They pilfered the on-demand food delivery market from Uber&rdquo;, just the type of technobabble you&rsquo;d expect to hear in a hipsterville coffee shop. Ed really just wasn&rsquo;t well equipped for such a place, he stood out like student reading in a library. Ed was no hipster, more like a... well I don&rsquo;t really know. He surely wasn&rsquo;t some culture appropriating, four-pound coffee purchasing, vaguely fashionable, special snowflake, citizen of the world.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Ed was just Ed: one father, mother, no siblings and pasty white British skin matching his straight brown hair that was about eight days overdue for a trim. Ed was far from unique. In fact, he was in the presence of twenty-five hipsters who weren&#39;t even aware of his existence. Not Ed&rsquo;s fault though, the poor bugger was simply underwhelming; masking into the background much like an old Woman&#39;s Day in a waiting room.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">There was nothing to Ed, nothing worth noting in particular. Ed, however, would disagree; he made quite a fine bangers and mash he thought to himself quite regularly. The echo chamber of his lonesome life led him to believe that he had in fact made the best bangers and mash in existence just last Monday. However, after producing such fine quality bangers and mash he was often left contemplating their importance within the universe. Primarily because he didn&rsquo;t have anyone to show off his incredible mashing skills to. Not that he was so inclined to the idea of having someone in his house late evening on a Monday.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">One thing in Ed&rsquo;s life was certain, his bangers and mash held superiority to those sleazy cardboard box meals you could buy in the frozen aisle of Tesco for a mere three-pound on a Monday. Today was a Monday, Ed had bangers and mash for dinner on Mondays. Today would be a great day.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Glancing across the room it almost appeared as if his food was coming. To quite the disappointment of the menu, Ed had scrolled right past the Apple Turnover, </span><span class="c1">Quesadilla, Quinoa Pilaf, Eggs Benedict and &ldquo;Sal&rsquo;s Breakfast Treat Pizza&rdquo;. Right at the bottom, Ed found Pancakes with bacon or blueberries: &pound;6.50. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take pancakes with bacon please&rdquo;, Ed ordered with a smile to the unconcerned waitress. &ldquo;That&rsquo;ll be 15 minutes, a drink with that?&rdquo;, &ldquo;Tea.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Whilst he&rsquo;d waited Ed pondered who Sal was. &ldquo;Sal&rsquo;s&rdquo; was the name of the diner but Ed hadn&rsquo;t seen anyone with an &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Sal&rdquo; T-shirt. It was doubtful the waitress&rsquo; name was Sal.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was the waitress coming back a mere five minutes later - impressively prompt. She tidily placed Ed&rsquo;s tea to the right of him and slid over the plate of pancakes and blueberries. The waitress had correctly assumed that Ed was right-handed like most people but had brought out a plate of pancakes and blueberries. Ed was certain he had placed an order for pancakes with bacon. He wasn&rsquo;t going to make a fuss about it though - he had just had two seamless interactions with another human being and was quite proud of his small success.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Having never been to Sal&rsquo;s before Ed was not quite sure what to expect but, he never would have expected this; the pancakes glistened in the soft light gleaming down from the oversized light bulb above. Slightly overfilling his mouth with the incredibly delicate pancakes, Ed could see why people would come here and buy a four-pound coffee.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was at the moment that Ed had reached the peak of his enjoyment that a woman entered the room, not that Ed would have known - too distracted by the sweetness of the blueberries. In the exact way Ed remained unnoticed by everyone this woman was not. Heads turned towards the new arrival, she was not beautiful but she had the walk of someone on a mission. She rather unnecessarily came in through the window. Glass shattered down around her pair of rugged brown workman&rsquo;s boots as people exited out the smokers&rsquo; door towards the back. Really causing quite the ruckus.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After a personal moment indulging in the pancakes, Ed glanced up and noticed the large figure of the woman rushing towards him, struck by mild panic he did the easiest, and least preferable option available - launching the plate piled with pancakes towards the assailant.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ed attempted to get up and run, to very quickly find he was out of shape and could not breathe due to the fluffy pancake gently lodged in his oesophagus. Lacking oxygen Ed&rsquo;s brain quickly shut down and the world went black as he hit the floor beside the rather nice porcelain plate he had quite inelegantly flung off the table.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moments later Ed would regain consciousness to the woman carrying him fireman-style out the front door down towards a motorcycle - inconsiderately waiting dead centre of the public walkway. He would also hear muffled sirens in the distance before seeing a police car squeal to a halt, the front left tire on the curb. Ed suddenly noticed the muffling was due to a rather uncomfortable helmet lodged on his head, tilted slightly off to the right. The helmet restricting movement in his jaw he would be unable to speak - inhibiting his ability to ask questions such as: &ldquo;Why they were on a motorcycle?, &ldquo;Is bangers and mash a significant part of the universe?&rdquo; And finally, &ldquo;What was in the backpack he was suddenly wearing?&rdquo;, It was rather heavy. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7">Ed pondered these inquiries as he mindlessly wrapped his arms around the mysterious motorcycle woman, setting in motion a series of events that would undoubtedly cause Ed to miss the latest instalment of Top Gear and fundamentally change Ed&rsquo;s Mondays forever.</span></p></body></html>
