# Crisis of Identity? The Mission and Managemnet of Universities in New Zealand
Wilf Malcolm & Nicholas Tarling

In writing this book, it is our hope to encourage all thise involved in the continuing life of universities to develop an informed understanding of the essential concepts within the idea of a university. Then, as they participate in the inevitable processes of change and deveopment they can help to ensure that the critical distinguishing funcvtions of a university are maintained  and enhanced.

The different size position history and discipline mix of universities means Michael Shattock suggests that an ideal academic organisational structure cannot be prescribed as a result university organisation driven as much by fashion by received ideas arriving from industry of the public sector as coherent thought about the organisational fit it is very rare the organisational changes driven by educational much more frequently organisational changes based on unresearched ideas about management. We agree such as too often been to practice we do not however think that it results from the different attributes of particular universities so much as the failure to consider what they have in common.

"Neither persons nor institutions  can steer a proper course in the face of diverging influences unless they have a firm grasp on their own identity" K.R. Minogue

## Origins
- NZ Uni origins in British, American and Australian standards
- NZ Own features
	- in part due to scattered population
	- priority on access
	- inadequate funding
	- emphasis on professional education
	- Large role in NZ, supporting sciences, liberal, creative and performing arts (often other countries have seperate institutions)
- Australian emulation 1950s Hughes Parry Committee (Labour) emulates Aussie Murray Committee. Set up the University Grants Committeee and quinquennial funding for 25 years. Abolished in 1980s
- 1980s 'New Right' Ideology reforms not redily accepted by unis, staff, students or alumni. Auckland and Canturbury take govt to court 1988/89 and modified 1990 education act.
	- However the ideology has pervailed, even in unis themselves

## Corporate and Academic Models
- [[Simon Marginson]]'s view is a 'collapse of academic identity' which is 'occurring more quickly' in australasia 'than in some other countries'.
	- The US has degree mills, but very seperate are the doctoral universities which 'retain a more robust sense of themselves embodying an academic mission and [the distintive social purposes conferred by that mission, moreso than our own universities]. In these insitutions coporate development is not necessarily persued at the expense of academic development'
- Governance and Management diverges between the corporate and academic models

## The idea of a university
- based on J.H. Newman's 1852 lectures and eventual book.
- Newmans primary notion: University should teach universal knowledge, truth is the objectof knowledge, truth means facts and their relations.
	- Sciences (disciplines) are the partial views of abstractions by means of which the mind looks out upon its object.
	- Viewed altogether they approcimatge toa representation of subjective reflection of the objective truth.
	- the sciences brought togeather wpi;d contribute ot an understanding of the whole, and students put inc contact with them would acquire a philosophic turn of mind. It is a great point to enlarge the range of studies which a University professes, even for the sake of the students, who, unable to study them all gain from being surrounded by those  who represent the whole circle.
	- Particularly he notes the value of collaboration and aid.
	- A student profits form intellectual tradition, apprehending the great outlines of knowledge and the principles oin which it rests. Hence it is that his education is call "Liberal". Such an education forms habits of mind of freedom, equitableness, calmness, moderation, and wisdom. This is the main purpose f a university in its treatment of its students.
	- Such a university gave a man a clear conscious view of his own  opinions and judgements, a truth in developing them, skills of expressing them, and a force in urging them.
	- University training aimed to raise the intellectual tone of a society, at cultivating the public mind, at purifying the national taste, supplying true principals to popular enthusiasm, and fixed aims to popular aspiration, enlargement and sobriety to the ideas of the age, facilitating the exercise of political power and redefining the intercourse of private life
	- Knowledge is still the outcome of human minds.
	- Intellectual formulation humans seek to make sense of the world in which they find themselves: physical, biological, phycological, social and spiritual realities as encountered by also interwoven with conceptual ways worlds constructed in the processes of knowing.
	- Such universal learning may compliment professional education an application of knowledge to the needs and interestes of society, but primarily concerned with advancing knowledge on a comprehensive basis.
	- Treatment of Copernicus (1473-1543) and Galileo (1564-1642) is evidence of conflict between approved views by authority such as church and state, and the findings within various disciplines emerging from the developing academic endeavours. Similar conflicts continue today but the context has developed from political and religious to commercial, economic and social issues brought into focus through the competitive character of market economies. Threat comes form from increasing pressures to secure commercial and economic benefits the societies and groups that financially support their existence. "Is it certain that a modern university can take risks in support of the intellectual adventure of its members?"
	- In the context of Karl Popper's words "our attempts to see and to find truth are not final but open to improvement", the inder of the university's two cheif aspects are that of the university as a community of scholars including both teachers and students and that of academic freedom, supporting and protecting the ongoin intellectual endeavours of the university and those within it. Both require but also justify the institutional authonomy of the university
	- Essential to a university's responsibility for the maintenence and advancement of knowledge is the collegial folr of this academic community.
	- Academic freedom is importatn due to the competing interests seeking control of their outcomes.
	- Academic freedom requires commitment ot the integration of teaching ad research
	- The outcomes of the persuit and attainment of knowledge include enhancement of professional, career and social responsibilities. Knowledge is critical to social, cultural and religious identity, capable of transforming societies and economies.

- Reconsidering the academic mission is essential for us [nz] and important for others.
- the idea emerged and developed over time
- early 20th cent. widely accepted idea of 'the university', idealistic
- The values and concepts we believe essential to the idea of the university are in danger of being undermined by unexamined consequences of operational and organisational changes. Some might be indeed claim that the univeristy is being changed by stealth rahter than as a result of rational argument, even though it is the very place where that should lest be expected. The insitution still claims adhearence to the idea of the university, but – admi all the other challenges it faces – its own practises may be undermining the realisation of the idea.
- The idea and institution of the university co-exist and influence one another
	- the emergence of the idea has come with a variety of of legislative prescriptions regulations and procedures specific to particular times and circumstance that have had an impact on the idea of a university
- New styles of Governance and Management may have something to offer, as long as it is in support of the main objective
	- However styles have been borrowed without sufficient forethought, impeeding the universitys objective.
	- if the governance and management do not back it or work against it and practice does not accord with principal and the character of the institution is changed though its name remains the same
		- what are sometimes called the collegiality of the system may for example be hollowed out bypassed merely nodded to this may seem to lead to efficiency in the short term reducing all those committees providing for prompt responses to government in the market and longer term it may be more damaging for collegiality is connected with shared responsibility and willingness and opportunity to speak out and those connected with the concept of freedom and that in turn with the capacity to offer objective criticism and pursue unfamilar ideas.
- we readily acknowledged that the idea of a university we shall expounded strongly based on European traditions and developments in the western world but the idea is based on human intellectual capacity and the desire to know and understand it is open to the intellectual traditions of all human societies and cultures continue to be shaped and developed with legitimate intellectual aspirations of all human bei that is indeed the first key components
- the emphasis on the community of scholars students and teachers became another key component of that idea
- main purpose of mediaeval institutions with to be useful and sense of professional training it was not this whole purpose
- the idea to keep alive educational breath and promote education as a lifelong processes means of affecting human qualities has been around every generation
- the use of the word university comes from that period. Then academic persons organise themselves into community commonly called a university university test make a storeroom at school or the whole body of teachers and students oxford english dictionary
- convenience asked in his Pedia PAMPAEDIA what is an Academy? One permanent assembly of wisemen two central library for books of every very available kind three factory for wisdom is occupied and earnest realistic continuous exercises. National province should have such an institution with residences or colleges where all students concentrate on wisdom segregated from craftsman and merchants and the general public\
- in 1988 representative of several hundred universities attended celebrations to the 900th anniversary of the university of Colonia. The magna was drawn up signed on 18th of September and which writers vice identified fundamental principles which now and always support medication of universities

	- teaching and researching universities must be inseparable their tuition is not very changing needs the demands of society and advances and scientific knowledge
	- freedom and research and is the fundamental principle university and governments and universities as far as in wise must ensure respect for this fundamental requirement rejecting intolerance and always dialogue universities and ideal meeting crown for teachers capable of imparting knowledge develop research invasion and students willing to enrich their minds with their knowledge
	- is the European tradition constant is to attain universal knowledge to fulfil its vocation transcends geographical political frontiers and firms the final different cultures to know and influence each other

- concept of research is now understood as much to the growth development of the natural physical  sciences especially from the 16th century onwards universities of 18th and 19th centuries developed to focus on research as an essential part learning especially but not solid graduate studies and scientific disciplines
- in those he is the chief concern of universities and such disciplines with the pursuit of knowledge and enlargement a few standing rather than logical consequences
- perspective was to change and it has changed particularly rapidly sometimes the technological developments made possible through increased understanding of creative strong education even challenged the idea of university for research often became very costly despite the fact that many of the most significant discovery super into speeded appreciate the merely curiosity driven and place focus on prescribed outcomes
- HELMHOLTZ insists that a teacher must have worked on the boundaries of human knowledge and concord new realms for it to impact convictions that are not sufficient for students to be directed by authorities of the knowledge but it is not for such as those who foundation for the conviction down to the very last fundamentals
