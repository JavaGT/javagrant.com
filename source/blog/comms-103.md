I am the tutor for Communications 103. It was a class I took myself in 2020, however it was a third-stage course at the time: Communications *301.*

The course was reworked into 103 in order to fill a new spot within the fresh [Bachelor of Communication (BC)](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/study/study-options/find-a-study-option/bachelor-of-communication.html) and is a core course of the major of [Communication and Technology](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/study/study-options/find-a-study-option/communication-and-technology.html).

In 2020, there was a teaching assistant who was also a student of the course. They were a computer-science student there to help debug our twitter bots and support out other class projects.

As I had experience with programming (specifically Javascript) I reached out to [Ethan](http://www.ethanplaut.com) and inquired about the teaching assistant role for the future. Next year Ethan got back to me with the position. I was co-teaching assistant for a 2021 with another student, then took on the role individually in 2022. In 2023 I became tutor for the course and am continuing tutoring for 2024.

Students do really well in this course! It has a very flexible and forgiving rubric and allows people to include their passions to enhance their projects. However, approaching computers and programming for Arts students it is certainly scary‚Äìbut those who give it a go come out much more confident in their abilities to learn and problem solve. Hopefully this encourages students towards a *Growth Mindset*.

> **Growth Mindset**
> 
> A student with a growth mindset tends to believe that learning and growth are possible in all areas tackle tasks with confidence that they can manage them explore new subjects and interests relish challenge, struggle and hard work because they believe this means they are improving acknowledge and reflect upon errors and mistakes as a means for improvement withstand setbacks, stay on track, and apply more effort when they face difficulties understand the value of effort and using strategies to overcome challenges see school as full of opportunities to learn.
