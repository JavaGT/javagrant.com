## What is enjoyable about the reading group?
We had a discussion today, in preperation for potentially more members (and inspired by [the reading](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-95834-7_10))
- Not attached to ideas we present and similarly not attacking people for ideas – addressing the ideas themselves.
- Good faith discussion (we loving having a critical discussion, even if prompted by something dumb)
- Learning more than individually
- Being comfortable in silence, explicitly no pressure or anxiety about contributing
- Knowing each other as people, beyond our identities within the university
- A topic we all care for, a shared passion for the university
- In and about a place that we love (and maybe loves us?)

To consider in future:
- Other locations
    - Still allow hybrid in person-online
    - Connect with more of the place
    - Sharing kai
- Non-reading based meetups – potentially time and space to realise our university ambitions
