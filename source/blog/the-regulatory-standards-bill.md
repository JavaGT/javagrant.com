# I/We wish to make the following comments
The Regulatory Standards bill is designed to impose a specific value set over all government policy going forward. Not only is this too much scope which would undermine the power of democratically elected representatives, but it also removes the autonomy of our country and hands it over to foreign capital. Decision making is core to our humanity. The imposition of free-market values that automate decisions based on outdated economic abstractions at every fork in the road means that we, the humans of Aotearoa, are no longer the creators of our own destiny. Our communities will suffer and the 'wealthy and sorted' will solidify their power against a further atomised and isolated New Zealand population who have had their steering wheel stolen by the ACT party and handed right over to international capital to colonise and privatise the common land, wildlife and beauty of the country we all share under Te Tiriti o Waitangi.
Our founding documentâ€“Te Tiritiâ€“is undermined by this bill, and given the limitless scope of the revisionist power of the bill, will be attacked in every component of our nation's policy and history. This will embolden the worst of us to make this country less safe for partners to that sacred agreement, and will discredit our nation amongst the most dignified in the world.
The regulatory standards bill and its proponents seek to undermine New Zealand's autonomy for their own private gain. May they fail at every turn.

# I/We wish to make the following recommendations

The Regulatory Standards Bill should be rejected fully and immediately.
