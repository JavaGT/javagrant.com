- Try contacting science advisor of the apporpirate organisation.

- [Public Policy Institute @ UoA](www.ppi.auckland.ac.nz)
    - [Policy Commons](www.policycommons.ac.nz)
    - Designed to be a knowledge hub across disciplines which disseminates evidence informed and policy relevant knowledge.
    - Amplify policy impact.

- Siloing across different disciplines. 
    - Science advisors meeting regularly has countered this.
- Wicked problems need multiple analytical lenses.


## Research impact
- Research impact is different to Academic impact
    - Academic impact is things like, number of citations etc.
    - Research impact is the contribution research makes to society, the environment and the economy (UoA Research Impact and Engagement Framework)
- Steps to impact
    - Plan for it
    - Capturing
    - Communicating


## Reasearch Impact Academy (Australia)
[RIA Impact Logic Model](https://www.safe-up.eu/news/knowledge-translation-road-safety-innovation)
- Co-create relevant research (collaboration is important! Other reseachers and communities)
- Output and activities (more than just academic outputs)
- Next users/receptors (who will deliver to)
- Outcomes & Early Impacts (Potential uptake and adoption/use of your output)
- Impacts (Potential long term consequence of using your output)


## International School on Research Impact Assessment

## things
- Anti-intellectualism in New Zealand can make things difficult.
- Engaging 'stakeholders' or next users.
- See yourself as a 'knowledge broker' whi gets it to where it needs to be
- Outputs don't necesserily create impact.
    - Think about activites that will creat impact (citizen assemblies?)

## Engagement
- Posts on social media != engagement
- Engagement involves
    - Influencing policy
    - Influencing public opinion (can lead to influencing policy & more)
    - Influencing voting (can lead to influencing policy)
    - Influencing industry (...)
- Building up relationships is the core to engagement
    - Relations with media
    - Relations with public
    - Relations with decision makers

    
## Barriers
- Power imbalances (who gets to speak)
- Differences in priorities
- Lack of transparency
- Unequal sharing of credit
- Communication barriers
- Politically or ethically sensitive
- Engagement fatigue
- Capacity and capability to engage

## The Policy Cycle (The Policy Process)
(Not a hard ruleset, an ideal model)
1. Agenda Setting
2. Polcy Formulation
3. Decision Making (most narrow perspective point)
4. Implimentation
5. Evaluation (Back to 1)
– Credit Curtis Warner

In reality, it's intricate interpay back and forth between the steps.
Evidence (our work) *can* fit into every step, but you don't need to be everywhere. Find your space.

## Whitepaper
(similar to a manifesto?)
Blank sheet of paper that is used to propose a bunch of things. 
Fits into the first two steps best.
Public document which often outlines and evaluations some options on the table.

## Decisions making
1. Who are the actors
2. What are their interestes
3. What constrains apply to the polcy problem
4. What constrains apply to the solution

## Implimentation
1. Clear solution details
2. Clear allocation of resources to organistaions
3. Clear delegation of decision makign authority

## Government Budget Cycle (Where in time should we set things up)
- Budget priorites are a representation of value systems
Build and find your moment. Start small if needed to find your space.

## Electoral Cycle

## NGO & Big-four Policy Influence
New Zealand doesn't have a developed NGO sector like other western nations. We have a centralisation problem. This leads to a large reliance on 'big four' consulting firms.


## Communication
- Triple Writing
    - Academic
    - Industry
    - Media (news, social)
- Evidence-based
- Clear, concise, engaging
- Pūrākau/Storytelling
- Explicit policy suggestions/implications

Consider how to take blue-skies research to explict steps and reccomendations

How is data presented? Make it tell a story so the steps of implimentation make sense. How does the story get formed after the data is presented? (Visual components help)

UoA PPI creates policy briefings (good examples)

## [Fast Track Impact Planning Template (Mark Reed)](https://www.fasttrackimpact.com/post/2019/03/18/research-impact-planning)

|Impact goal|Relevant parties|Activities|Impact indicators|Impact risks |Risk mitigation|Organisational comments|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|Describe the benefit that will be delivered|Name of organisation(s), group(s) or individual(s) who will benefit from these impacts, who may be able to help us to deliver impacts or who are interested in these impacts for other reasons (see your 3i analysis)|Identify activities that could enable these parties to get the benefits described in the impact goal, or enable them to deliver these benefits for others|What would success look like, and how would you capture this for communication to others? Identify indicators that you could measure (either qualitatively or quantitatively) to demonstrate that your impact goal(s) have been achieved|Identify risks that could prevent impacts from being achieved and/or that could lead to negative unintentional consequences|Explain how the identified risks can be mitigated|Who will be responsible for delivering the impact goal? Identify any other organisational needs e.g. funding, training or other resources that may needed, and proposed initial actions and timings|
|Articulate your goal as specifically as possible. This can include goals of other organisations whose impacts we want to help achieve|Write the name(s) here|Write the activities here|List relevant indicators and means of measurement here|List risks, explaining the nature and magnitude of each risk|Provide risk mitigation narrative here|List anything else necessary to achieve the impact here|

## Discussion
Really interesting discussion on feeling hopeless in the face of large detrimnetal forces (e.g. economic dependancy on harmful products).
- Slow work is good work
- Making change to just a single person is important.
- Understanding that even just a delay against the damage is progress.


## My thoughts
This workshop got me thinking about my research in terms of the policy cycle. I think the policy cycle provides a good framework for understanding the role of this project. Considering we know step 5 is well established re: the current insitutions – so now is time for Agenda Setting, Policy Formulation & Implimentation (Decision making less relevent because of the democratic and paticipatory nature of the research workshops), and then hopefully evaluation.

1. **Agenda Setting**
2. **Polcy Formulation**
3. Decision Making (most narrow perspective point)
4. **Implimentation**
5. ***Evaluation***
