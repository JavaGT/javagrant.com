As a part of the [reading group](/blog/critical-universtiy-studies-reading-group), I am contributing to a pamphlet for 2024 Semester 2 *Disorientation*. The purpose is to get people–new students particularly–considering the university insitution critically. Our priorities include:
- Grounding it in place (Tamaki Makarau, Aotearoa)
- Connecting people to organisations on and around campus who do good work
- Developing a critical conception of the university and it's administrative structure, similar to the prior [*We are the university* movement](https://www.facebook.com/WearetheUniversityAkl/).
