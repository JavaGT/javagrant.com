Placeholder for my notes on ["The University and The Undercommons" in The Undercommons: Fugitive Planning & Black Study by Stefano Harney and Fred Moten (2013, p.22)](https://www.minorcompositions.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/undercommons-web.pdf)


"THE ONLY POSSIBLE RELATIONSHIP TO THE UNIVERSITY TODAY IS A CRIMINAL ONE"

"it cannot be denied that the university is a place of refuge, and it cannot be accepted that the university is a place of enlightenment."

"In the face of these conditions one can only sneak into the university and steal what one can. To abuse its hospitality, *to spite its mission*[?], to join its refugee colony, its gypsy encampment, **to be in but not of** ‚Äì this is the path of the subversive intellectual in the modern university."


*the subversive intellectual came under false pretenses*[?], with bad documents, **out of love**. Her labor is as necessary as it is unwelcome. The university needs what she bears but cannot bear what she brings. And on top of all that, she disappears. She disappears into the underground, the downlow low-down maroon community of the university, into the undercommons of enlightenment, **where the work gets done**, where the work gets subverted, where the revolution is still black, still strong.


"What is that work and what is its social capacity for both reproducing the university and producing fugitivity? If one were to say teaching, one would be performing the work of the university. Teaching is merely a profession and *an operation of that onto-/auto-encyclopedic circle of the state*[?]‚Äù that Jacques Derrida calls the Universitas. But it is useful to invoke this operation to glimpse the hole in the fence where labor enters, to glimpse its hiring hall, its night quarters. The university needs teaching labor, despite itself, or as itself, *self-identical with and thereby erased by it*[?]. It is not teaching that holds this social capacity, but something that produces the not visible other side of teaching, a thinking through the skin of teaching toward a collective *orientation to the knowledge object*[?] as future project, and a commitment to what we want to call the prophetic organization."

- Interpretation: The subversive potential of teaching lies in its ability to challenge the normative functions of the university.

"it is teaching that brings us in. Before there are grants, research, conferences, books, and journals there is the experience of being taught and of teaching."

"The moment of teaching for food is therefore often mistakenly taken to be a stage, as if eventually one should not teach for food. If the stage persists, there is a social pathology in the university. But if the teach- ing is successfully passed on, the stage is surpassed, and teaching is consigned to those who are known to remain in the stage, the socio- pathological labor of the university. Kant interestingly calls such a stage ‚Äúself-incurred minority.‚Äù He tries to contrast it with having the ‚Äúdeter- mination and courage to use one‚Äôs intelligence without being guided by another.‚Äù ‚ÄúHave the courage to use your own intelligence.‚Äù But what would it mean if teaching or rather what we might call ‚Äúthe beyond of teaching‚Äù is precisely what one is asked to get beyond, to stop taking sustenance? And what of those minorities who refuse, the tribe of moles who will not come back from beyond (that which is beyond ‚Äúthe beyond of teaching‚Äù), as if they will not be subjects, as if they want to think as objects, as minority? Certainly, the perfect subjects of com- munication, those successfully beyond teaching, will see them as waste. But their collective labor will always call into question who truly is tak- ing the orders of the enlightenment. The waste lives for those moments beyond teaching when you give away the unexpected beautiful phrase ‚Äì unexpected, no one has asked, beautiful, it will never come back. Is being the biopower of the enlightenment truly better than this?"

- Interpretation: Critiques the socio-economic conditions of university teaching where teaching is reduced to a means of sustenance while researching is the end goal ('ideals of the enlightenment'). Challenges that true enlightenment comes from transcending "teaching for food." and proposes value in collective labour of resisting normative structures of the university.

"*the life stolen by enlightenment*[?] and stolen back, where the commons give refuge, where the refuge gives commons. What the beyond of teaching is really about is not finishing oneself, not passing, not completing; it‚Äôs about allowing subjectivity to be unlawfully overcome by others, a radical passion and passivity such that one becomes unfit for subjection, because one does not possess the kind of agency that can hold the regulatory forces of subjecthood, and one cannot initiate the auto-interpellative torque that biopower sub- jection requires and rewards. It is not so much the teaching as it is the prophecy in the organization of the act of teaching. The prophecy that predicts its own organization and has therefore passed, as commons, and the prophecy that exceeds its own organization and therefore as yet can only be organized. Against the prophetic organization of the undercommons is arrayed its own deadening labor for the university, and beyond that, the negligence of professionalization, and the professionalization of the critical academic. The undercommons is therefore always an unsafe neighborhood."

- Interpretation: 
    - **Fugitive Enlightenment**: Enlightenment escaping normativity of traditional enlightenment & institutionalized knowledge including instead marginalized and criminalized identities and acts of reclaiming life.
    - **Undercommons**: where traditional norms and professionalization are challenged. stands in opposition to the professionalization of critical academics.
    - **Prophetic Teaching**: Teaching in the undercommons is not about completing a set curriculum but about fostering a visionary and transformative form of collective knowledge and existence.

"As Fredric Jameson reminds us, the university depends upon ‚ÄúEn- lightenment-type critiques and demystification of belief and commit- ted ideology, in order to clear the ground for unobstructed planning and ‚Äòdevelopment.‚Äô‚Äù This is the weakness of the university, the lapse in its homeland security. It needs labor power for this ‚Äúenlightenment- type critique,‚Äù but, somehow, labor always escapes."

- **Elusive Labor**: Labor power required for critique is resistant to control seeking autonomy and freedom in their work. A tension where the university needs this labor but cannot fully contain or control it.

- **Enlightenment Paradox**: Principles of critique and rationality, foundational to the university, also question and demystify which cannot be fully contained within any institutional framework.
