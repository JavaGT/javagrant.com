Doing some research here for an RSVP system to support [Whakatipu Mana Kai](https://www.instagram.com/whakatipumanakai/).

|Option|Price|Comments|

|[Google Forms](https://www.google.com/forms/about/)|Free|Used by [TPM](https://www.tepunahamatatini.ac.nz) for managing their events. Can email you when people fill the form and put data into a google spreadsheet and can provide the atendee a confirmation email for submitting the form (not custom I think)|

Considerations: RSVP desired, but not stricly necessary for every participant. Importantly, people can come if they have forgotten to RSVP, but don't want to encourage delaying or avoiding RSVP. Perhaps an "I'm interested" option to sign up for updates to the event or a reminder beforehand to RSVP closer to the date (if they aren't yet sure if they want/can attend).
