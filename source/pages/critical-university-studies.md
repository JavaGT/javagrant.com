        - the undercommons is a space of activity invisible to capitalism as it cannot be exploited or be 'productive' in terms of capital accumulation (or be measured at all). 
        - capitalism has a sensorium, it can 'perceive' some things (exploitable), while other things escape its senses ("Bad debt is senseless, which is to say it cannot be perceived by the senses of capital"). 
        - Lots occurs beneath the perception of capital (M&H probably say most things).
        - M&H use vocabulary of legibility or comprehension: "Governance is a way to make it [social life] more legible to them in certain ways". 
        - Problem for capitalism (and the state): how to capture all this activity? Translate undercommon sociality to be percieved and rendered productive on terms used and exploited by capital? Debt! (debt understood in terms of credit). 
        - M&H distinguish between 'bad debt' and debt in terms of credit.
            - Debt is often a means to establish relationships (anthropology): people maintain debts to maintain relationships: debt circulates perpetually so that one never pays it off (think about buying rounds of beers among friends). Paying it off, 'calling it even', is a way of ending a relationship.
            - Debt relations among the Tiv of Nigeria (David Graeber):
                - "It would be entirely inappropriate to simply accept three eggs from a neighbor and never bring anything back. One did not have to bring back eggs, but one should bring something back of approximately the same value. One could even bring money - there was nothing inappropriate in that - provided one did so at a discreet interval, and above all, that one did not bring the exact cost of the eggs. It had to be either a bit more or a bit less. ... To bring back an exact equivalent would be to suggest that one no longer wishes to have anything to do with the neighbor. ... Tiv women, [writes one anthropologist], might spend a good part of the day walking for miles to distant homesteads to return a handful of okra or a tiny bit of change, "in an endless circle of gifts to which no one ever handed over the precise value of the object last received "- and in doing so, they were continually creating their society." (u/Streetli's emphasis).
            - "Credit is a means of privatization and debt a means of socialisation... debt is social and credit is asocial" (M&H).
                - Debt creates sociality. What destroys it, is equivalence. "Creditors ... try to calculate [debt] ... Credit keeps track ... Credit pursues the student, offering to match credit for debt". 
                - Debt of sociality is never a matter of equivalence: it's meant to be kept in circulation, "either a bit more or a bit less", to maintain relationships. Dis-equilibrium is the point.
                - Debt of sociality is is the kind of debt that M&H call upon: "It is not credit we seek nor even debt but bad debt which is to say real debt, the debt that cannot be repaid ... excessive debt, incalculable debt, debt for no reason, debt broken from credit, debt as its own principle."
        - Governance tries to 'capture' this social, excessive debt, by means of 'credit', ammounting to privitization of the social.
            - "Credit is a means of privatization". 
            - Establishing of relations of equivalence between debt and credit destroys the social links forged by debt.
            - Social debt always 'escapes' this attempt at capture, is always a 'fugitive': "But debt runs in every direction, scatters, escapes, seeks refuge. ... This refuge, this place of bad debt, is what we call the fugitive public".
            - Fugitive debt cannot be 'perceived' by capital and governance, it runs 'beneath' it, always in excess of it.
                - Harney uses the vocabulary of 'prospecting', as in, to 'mine beneath the ground', where the 'ground' can be understood to be that which capital can see, perceive, or read.
            - M&H think we are almost always OK with bad debt
                - only under conditions of governance and capitalism is bad debt is seen as bad at all. 
                - They place emphasis on 'forgetting': we simply forget debt.
                - The sociality of debt is default.
                - Graeber's book on Debt, develops 'baseline communism'/'everyday communism', which makes up a huge amount of our everyday lives, even through we never think about it in these terms.
                    - "Almost everyone follows this principle if they are collaborating on some common project. If someone fixing a broken water pipe says, "Hand me the wrench," his co-worker will not, generally speaking, say, "And what do I get for it?" .... First among [those we treat this way] are those we love, with mothers being the paradigm of selfless love. Others include close relatives, wives and husbands, lovers, one's closest friends. These are the people with whom we share everything, or at least to whom we know we can turn in need, which is the definition of a true friend everywhere. ... One could go on from here to various forms of sharing, pooling, who gets to call on whom for help with certain tasks: moving, or harvesting, or even, if one is in trouble, providing an interest-free loan. Finally, there are the different sorts of "commons," the collective administration of common resources".
                    - almost all our interactions are not held to account (measured debt). Everyday sharing, help and community (time and resources shared and spent with family, housemates, friends, and colleagues, even strangers) do not place us in credit-relations with each other. It's just circulating debt that is forgotten as soon as it is incurred. Forgotten and not, importantly, forgiven. 
                    - "Debt cannot be forgiven, it can only be forgotten to be remembered again. To forgive debt is to restore credit.
                - 'bad debt' is already everywhere:
                    - "debt runs in every direction, scatters, escapes, seeks refuge. The debtor seeks refuge among other debtors, acquires debt from them, offers debt to them ... Here [in the undercommons] they meet those others who dwell in a different compulsion, in the same debt, a distance, forgetting, remembered again but only after. These other ones carry bags of newspaper clippings, or sit at the end of the bar, or stand at the stove cooking, or sit on a box at the newsstand, or speak through bars, or speak in tongues".
                    - I read these lines as M&H getting at the 'everydayness' of bad debt, it's being everywhere, and people being OK with it because it's simply the default. What's to be explained for M&H is less how we are OK with bad debt, but how we ever came not to be.
- There's a deep Nietzschian strain among all this
    - "To be incapable of taking one's enemies, one's accidents, even one's misdeeds seriously for very long—that is the sign of strong, full natures in whom there is an excess of the power to form, to mold, to recuperate and to forget (a good example of this in modem times is Mirabeau, who had no memory for insults and vile actions done him and was unable to forgive simply because he—forgot)" (Genealogy of Morals).
