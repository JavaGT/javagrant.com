    - A video about disposable vapes, and how addiction became the goal of every single company on the planet.
    - Written, directed and presented by Tom Nicholas.
    - Disposable vapes have taken over. In just two short years, Elf Bar, Lost Mary and their various competitors have become a ubiquitous part of modern life. The popularity of these devices among children and young people has led many governments to ban (or consider banning) them. But, I want to look beyond the minutiae of vaping legislation and instead ask what it is about our society that has led these devices to prosper.
    - In this first episode: we're looking at addiction, and how companies across our economy have begun to borrow tricks from the vaping industry to design consumer choice out of the system.
