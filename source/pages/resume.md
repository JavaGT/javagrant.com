[Successfully ran a campaign](https://sites.google.com/view/social-sciences-open-letter/home) to garnish student awareness and engage with faculty over funding cuts to the Social Sciences, despite an increase in enrollments.

## First in Family
Beginning my degree, I was surprised by many aspects of the academic system. I was unfamiliar with even simple elements, for example, correctly referencing sources in my essays. While I may not have had access to experienced family members, I substituted for another resource - my friends. I’m proud of my success at university, and that much of it is due to my ability to engage with both students and faculty to problem-solve and overcome difficulties in the new environment.
