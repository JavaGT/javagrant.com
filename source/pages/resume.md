“The Arts Scholars courses consider important subjects in-depth and explore alternate perspectives. Learning and curiosity are the ultimate goal. Also, the people are pretty cool.” - _Java._ {.quote}

During my final year of the programme, I'm undergoing a research project into the educational pedagogy of social science YouTube videos to understand how to effectively use videos for scalable, accessible, and engaging education.

## Kerikeri High School

One of my most rewarding roles was that of Kiwi Buddy. Tasked with making international students welcome in their new school and culture, I befriended 50+ incredible people from all over the world. Directly I was assigned to students from Switzerland, Japan, and the United States.

This programme hugely influenced my life and led me to travel the world in 2018.

## 💰 Social Sciences Funding Cuts
I [successfully ran a campaign](https://sites.google.com/view/social-sciences-open-letter/home) to garnish student awareness and engage with faculty reguarding funding cuts to the Social Sciences, despite an increase in enrollments. I handed off this social momentum to the Arts Students Organisation at the university.

## 📜 Student Consultations
Involvement in the organisation, participation and management of various forms of student consultation at The University of Auckland, working with AUSA, the Arts faculty, and the Arts Scholars programme.

## 🖼 Visualiser.js
I constructed a framework for generating live audio visualisers in the browser. Using JavaScript, the HTML Audio API and HTML canvas, this framework enables anyone with even a small amount of programming knowledge to create an audio visualiser in 2d, 3d or both!
The framework allows the use of customisable plugins and layers to generate graphics on the fly.

## 🧑‍🎓 First in Family
Beginning my degree, I was surprised by many aspects of the academic system. I was unfamiliar with even simple elements, for example, correctly referencing sources in my essays. While I may not have had access to experienced family members, I substituted for another resource — my friends. I’m proud of my success at university, much of it due to my ability to engage with students and faculty to problem-solve and overcome difficulties in the new environment.
