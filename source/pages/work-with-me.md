Kia ora!

I'm interested in all kinds of cool things. If you think I can help you, [send me a message](#contact)! No harm in asking ðŸ™‚.

I have skills of various capabilities accross a wide variety of things. I'm generally happy to provide some basic consultation of how to solve problems for free for anyone doing interesting work with good intentions and if I've got the time (and you've got the cause) I might be able to offer more.

## Skills
### Research
#### Interviewing
#### Workshops
#### Analysis
#### Examining Literature
### Critical Thinking
### Communication
### Events
#### Hands-on-deck
Need someone who can problem-solve on their feet and support your event? Let me know.
I've even build custom software for events. Want live photo screens for instagram posts of your event? I've done it before!
### Networking
I know heaps of cool people.

Probably my greatest skill is getting to know great people doing great things. If you've got an interest in anything from [origami](https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/e-plaut) to [unionism](https://www.linkedin.com/in/xavier-walsh-94a665231/), I probably know someone you should talk to!
