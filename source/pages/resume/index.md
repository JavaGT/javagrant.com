[The Arts Scholars programme](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/arts/study-with-us/study-options/arts-scholars.html) has been the defining aspect of my university experience.

“The Arts Scholars courses consider important subjects in-depth and explore alternate perspectives. Learning and curiosity are the ultimate goal. Also, the people are pretty cool.” - _Java._ {.quote}

During my final year of the programme, I'm undergoing a research project into the educational pedagogy of social science YouTube videos to understand how to effectively use videos for scalable, accessible, and engaging education.

## 🏫 Kerikeri High School

# 🗳 Student Representation
I have presented the interests of students to the university on multiple occasssions, in various formats, including through the creation of feedback sessions between students and faculty.

## 💰 Social Sciences Funding Cuts
I [successfully ran a campaign](https://sites.google.com/view/social-sciences-open-letter/home) to garnish student awareness and engage with faculty reguarding funding cuts to the Social Sciences, despite an increase in enrollments. I handed off this social momentum to the Arts Students Organisation at the university.

## 📜 Student Consultations
Involvement in the organisation, participation and management of various forms of student consultation at The University of Auckland, working with AUSA, the Arts faculty, and the Arts Scholars programme.

Issues covered include mechanisms of communication, university–student relations, and the responsibilities of the university in creating a safe and effective educational space for all students.

## 🖼 Visualiser.js
I constructed a framework for generating live audio visualisers in the browser. Using JavaScript, the HTML Audio API and HTML canvas, this framework enables anyone with even a small amount of programming knowledge to create an audio visualiser in 2d, 3d or both!
The framework allows the use of customisable plugins and layers to generate graphics on the fly.

# 📄 Assignments
I have completed a number of assignments I am particularly proud of. In order to not overwhelm this page, I have placed them on their own part of the website here

## 🤦‍♀️ Facelist
As a submission for [Comms 301](https://artsfaculty.auckland.ac.nz/courses/?Subject=COMMS&Number=301&Year=2020), I created Facelist, a Facebook satire that you can access [here](/static/facelist).

Tip: try clocking in with "Harry" or "Frodo".

Mark: 10/10

"Amazing work. This is really biting in its critique, and your reflection as you walk through your project is really insightful. The amount of detail you have taken in altering Facebook is incredible." _-Tutor_ {.quote}

"Ahhhhh facelist is amazing!!" _-Lecurer_ {.quote}

[You can explore facelist here.](/static/facelist)

## 🚫 Anti-bullying Programme
For [Sociol 326](https://artsfaculty.auckland.ac.nz/courses/?Subject=SOCIOL&Number=326&Year=2021) I designed 'Got what it takes', a violence prevention programme targeting bullying behaviours in New Zealand high schools.
The assignment was grounded in role strain theory, included methods for evaluating the programme and acknowledged potential limitations of implimentation.

Mark: 39/40

"One word: Sophistication 
If you explicitly talked about the interconnection between the Role Strain and HM, it would be even better." _–Tutor._

## The Past, Present and Future of Labour Facilitation
This essay looks into the shifting role of labour and capital in labour relations under the uber model of production. The obligations of labourers are increasing while their job stability, incomes and rights are all shrinking. Adittionally, labourers are now expected to front capital in order to sell their labour, while recieveing none of the traditional capitalist rewards.

Mark: 25/25

"This is a well researched and well written piece of work. While you present a wide array of technologies and businesses as examples, you manage to package them in a clearly structured and coherent essay that works to analyze technological progress through an economic determinist view. You demonstrate a wealth of knowledge and understanding when it comes to the processes of labor and the impacts caused by the systems that facilitate these processes. Also how technology and the 'Uber' model could be playing into those ideas under capitalism and the exploitation of automation.  I am deeply impressed and highly commend you on your work and efforts with this assignment. Well done!" _-Tutor_ {.quote}

[You can read the essay here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vR-RxTAxTY_eRFZABN_VAb38Xx2wETsmTDluaxlQgHjmrm1RS-L2zLfIQ_HMq1ErEf6gM_CM5ZYmtSk/pub)

## Ethnicity & Place Stratification in Auckland

This essay uses Spatial Assimilation and Place Stratification theories to model the effects of race and ethnicity. Specifically how these factors effect actualising socio-economic status into real attainment, for the minority Māori population in the Auckland region. The arguments are supported along the way by quantitative data collected from NZ.Stat.

Mark: 20/20

"Well done Java on an insightful paper. This is the type of data analysis that is important to begin conversations on discrimination and racism. Congratulations on an outstanding paper." _-Lecturer_ {.quote}

## Autobiography – My Role in Gentrification

Mark: 30/30

"Thank you for sharing your experiences with me Java. As always, you have written a wonderfully critical paper. Your ability to weave not only the personal with theory but also Auckland city with broader national concerns is to be commended. I have enjoyed getting to know you this semester through your writing, and I look forward to having you in my classes again in the future." _-Lecturer_ {.quote}

## Marxist Theory for Ihumatao

Mark: 19/20

"Well done Java on an intellectually stimulating analysis of Ihumātao. I look forward to reading more of your work." _-Lecturer_ {.quote}

## Anti-Union Rhetoric and Structure: It’s time for unions to re-brand

Mark: 28.2/30

"Good use of examples, excellent work, moves a bit fast at points and could benefit from slower more methodical explanation, but otherwise a very strong essay. Well done!" _-Tutor_ {.quote}

## Analysis of Intimate Partner Relationships in The Tattoo

Mark: 18.5/20

"Java, excellent job. All 3 of us (Tutor1, Tutor2 and me) read your essay. Tutor2 described it as "beautiful" and although we assume you put a good deal of work into it, they said it read as if it was written effortlessly.
Our only critique is you cut back on digging into one theoretical perspective. Your application of the theories are great, but a bit more describing selected theories would have helped. You do a good job with hegemonic masculinity. With coercive control, you introduce and bring out a detailed aspect of Starks' perspective with safety zones. But you don't define it thoroughly and you had some word count space to do so. Still, your application of CC and HM is great. Good job also bringing in Foucault. Overall, a very sophisticated analysis." _–Lecturer_ {.quote}

## Data Gathering Instrument

Mark: 25/25

"Kia Ora Java,
I enjoyed reading your assignment as it eloquently offers a refined data gathering instrument and literature review. Your literature is insightful and offers nuance to your research question. Great incorporation of graphs. Well done!" _–Tutor_ {.quote}

[You can view the instrument here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSHCPAlBcfdgPAESn58VvbAis2-J0Q-L383pSfpwJdAerFzGV-BJSHrkf4hJC4Fz3uHgYavMDOP-qBA/pub)

## The Contested Definition of Culture
This was my first university essay! 

Mark: 17/20

"Kia ora Java,
This was an interesting and well articulated essay, which followed a clear narrative progression, however this could have been outlined more clearly in the introduction.
Discussion of the conservative scholars covered some important aspects of their work, and engaged well with critiques. 
This is contrasted well with that of Williams, however the discussion included the perspective of so many scholars that the essay could not address these in detail. Nonetheless, as the different definition are discussed, the implications are acknowledged for most of these. Narrowing the scope of the essay to allow for more detailed analysis would have allowed for a higher mark, but nonetheless this was great work." _–Tutor_ {.quote}

[You can read the essay here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRVrDKpsPdKN9dIuO1Cu66s7YDoLYnIfnplx6ySSIR5qjgr3mdvVOHWIDAFPY1ckb2YJNdfaD_9iD6F/pub)

## The Right to Remix: Lessons from _Pirate Cinema_.

Mark: 27/30

"Kia ora Java,
This was an engaging project essay, with the cultural text and essay question chosen aligning well.
The discussion of the text is contextualised well within debates around copyright law, acknowledging the differing perspectives on this. While this is important contextual information, a lot of the essay was dedicated to exploring this issue, meaning that there was less opportunity for focus on the analysis of the cultural text at hand, or the work of Jenkins as the subject of the essay question.
Nonetheless, when these subjects are explored in the essay they are done so well, demonstrating a good understanding of the appropriate theory. Overall, this was an excellent essay." _–Tutor_ {.quote}

## Meme Twitter Bot

Mark: 15/15

"This is SO GOOD. The Tracery grammar developing the text, as you note, could be improved, expanded, developed in different directions, but even in this kind of raw dadaist version, the mashup is great! Would be curious to hear about that bug and why you chose url.me instead of memegen? Holler!" _–Lecturer_ {.quote}

## Review of _In the Age of AI_

Mark: 25/25

"Kia ora Java,
This is a very well-written and insightful review that delves into the complexities of your text while also addressing the ways in which an audience can absorb this information.
I particularly enjoyed the way in which you infused your own background in sociology to articulate how the documentary comments on the economic impacts of automation. You've also interestingly pointed out the documentary's shortcomings in how it frames its subject through the consequences of misusing technology to hard company profits, while rightly pointing out concern for those same companies to suffer no backlash under the pretense of creating jobs.
I found this to be a very thought-provoking piece that explored the various facets of technological determinism and the ways in which it can lead to an increase in unemployment with the rise of automation.
Well done!" _–Tutor_ {.quote}

## Postmodern Advertising: The role of brands as a cultural resource for identity signalling.

Mark: 17/20

"Java,
Your essay shows a good understanding of the essay question and Holt's discussion on cultural resource versus cultural blueprint. The approach you have taken in focusing L&P as a brand is a great strength to your essay and indicates a great-level of engagement with course content. The main point of feedback I have for you is your application of concepts. While you have identified and included a number of key terms, they are needing some further unpacking in order to consider their significance and the effect upon the ad itself in taking this approach. By doing this you will be able to strengthen your argument as a whole and allow for a smoother flow of ideas. This essay is a great start and clearly shows your strong understanding of the content and ability to successfully undergo independent research. Nice work!
If you have any questions or if any of my feedback needs clarifying please don't hesitate to let me know." _–Tutor_ {.quote}

## 🧑‍🎓 First in Family
Beginning my degree, I was surprised by many aspects of the academic system. I was unfamiliar with even simple elements, for example, correctly referencing sources in my essays. While I may not have had access to experienced family members, I substituted for another resource — my friends. I’m proud of my success at university, much of it due to my ability to engage with students and faculty to problem-solve and overcome difficulties in the new environment.
