Selfdecribed on my home page, I am a...
"Student, brother, friend, teacher, programmer, surfer, skater, sun-bather, boardgamer, researcher, adventurer, streamer, tweeter, hopeful do-gooder."

So let me explain...

## Student
I am a student. I hope to carry the spirit of learning and open mindedness with me wherever I go. I am also the dominant understanding of student, enrolled in the doctorate programme with the University of Auckland School of Social Sciences.

I'm very serious about learning though. I like problem solving, and my problem solving skills are entirely founded upon what I know about the world. What people think of as 'learning' is often a limited and sad view of education as a means to some specific end, and too often that end is unsatisfying, such as the persuit of wealth. A shame it is so difficult to see the value in anything, including learning, beyond it's service to capital. But once you can see the value beyond that framework, learning beceomes so much more enchanting.
