Selfdecribed on my home page, I am a...
"Student, brother, friend, teacher, programmer, surfer, skater, sun-bather, boardgamer, researcher, adventurer, streamer, tweeter, hopeful do-gooder."

So let me explain...

## Student
I am a student. I hope to carry the spirit of learning and open mindedness with me wherever I go. I am also the dominant understanding of student, enrolled in the doctorate programme with the University of Auckland School of Social Sciences.

I'm very serious about learning though. I like problem solving, and my problem solving skills are entirely founded upon what I know about the world. What people think of as 'learning' is often a limited and sad view of education as a means to some specific end, and too often that end is unsatisfying, such as the persuit of wealth. A shame it is so difficult to see the value in anything, including learning, beyond it's service to capital. But once you can see the value beyond that framework, learning beceomes so much more enchanting.

## Brother
## Friend
## Teacher
I love to teach, but I wish to be better at it. Generally my teaching is a passionate rant about a topic of my interest. It's much more fun when it is a conversation or a problem solving session with someone who is overcoming or finding a solution to a problem they have.

I find teaching hardest when I don't have immediate feedback. It is really hard to decide to keep developing ideas or backtrack and rearticulate something differently when you don't know if the message is being recieved effectively. This makes teaching to a sea of disabled cameras on zoom basicaly my nightmare (less so with an active chat).

## Programmer
Starting off with MIT's Scratch when I was a kid. I quickly learned how to make a youtube video proxy with PHP in order to get around the content filter of my highschool when they introduced wifi for our devices. From there I learn some web design (shoutout [DevTips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJhhLvW-Xvg&list=PLqGj3iMvMa4KeBN2krBtcO3U90_7SOl-A)) and eventually jumped into NodeJS.

Lots of my technical skill come from being too poor to afford anything and learning to do it myself–making things work or accessing things like movies and music. Particularly videogames. I learnt how computer programs are structured and how file/code patching can modify the apps on your computer by trying to run games my friends that I couldn't access. I learnt what RAM was by having a laptop too crappy to launch Minecraft, and then how to upgrade RAM through the extra RAM slot accessable at the bottom of my laptop (could you imagine this now??). Dealing with conflicting mod class files when pacthing my minecraft.jar or digging into my router in order to try portforwarding so my friends could access a server running on my laptop which would burn my leg running Skype, Minecraft Client and Minecraft Server with a whole 3 players. Trying to automate resource collection in Runescape. Controlling Turtles in [ComputerCraft]. Building a computer from TradeMe parts and avoiding a whole $100 on Windows 7 (total budget was $250ish). Trying to learn digital art, or modify a Mincraft Texturepack needed tools like Photoshop CS6. I spent more time figuring out how to get things to work than I did actually listening, watching, using, or playing them.
