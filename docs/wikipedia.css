/*
  Cleaned and readable stylesheet for the static site pages
  Focused on the structure used in docs/index.html (header, nav, information block,
  infobox/right-data, wiki content and tables). This file intentionally uses
  clear selectors, comments and responsive rules for maintainability.

  Notes:
  - Many pages contain generated `gen-style-*` classes. This stylesheet uses
    semantic selectors (elements, ids and utility classes) to style the page
    consistently. It will override most inline/generated rules where needed.
  - Keep this file small and readable; add additional component-specific rules
    below rather than expanding `gen-style-*` coverage.
