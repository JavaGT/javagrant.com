    Research participation invite: Seeking Hopeful Futures for the Universities of Aotearoa
</h1>

<p>
    Kia ora,  <br>
    I am a PhD student conducting a research project which aims to collaboratively develop visions of university futures with university adjacent activists in Aotearoa. The purpose of this study is to develop grass-roots understandings of universities’ futures, measuring what their communities see as possible, probable, and preferable. This project amplifies and reflects upon the experiences of community leaders in order to develop resources for agenda setting and continuity of grassroots activism. Participation in this project involves a roughly 1 hour long interview, led by myself Java Grant, a PhD student researcher. These interviews are open-ended and are guided in collaboration with participants.  <br>
    I am reaching out for your participation as I believe you are or have been involved with university-adjacent activism around one of New Zealand’s universities and your contributions would be highly valued. Please be assured your participation is voluntary, and any identifying information will be held in confidence with the researcher. If you are interested in participating, and meet the following criteria, please contact java.grant@auckland.ac.nz with any questions. I have attached the participant information sheet. Some snacks and drink will be available during in-person interviews and a small koha provided to all participants as a token of appreciation.
