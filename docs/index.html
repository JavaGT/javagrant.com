            A Critical Case Study of the University of Auckland Administration

        This research critically examines the University of Auckland's (UoA)
        administration's response to a staff strike in October 2022, set against
        the backdrop of wider challenges facing New Zealand's universities. It
        portrays the UoA as a neoliberal entity employing unreliable narratives
        to sustain its power and diminish the intrinsic social value of higher
        education. The study links the well-being of students, faculty, and
        society to the broader mission of universities, highlighting the adverse
        effects of capitalism on academic integrity through the commodification
        of education, the perpetuation of social hierarchies, and the
        commercialization of knowledge. It sheds light on the exploitation
        inherent in precarious academic employment and argues that
        neoliberalism, by promoting competitive pressures, leads to exploitation
        through reduced pay, increased workloads, and minimal contractual
        protections. The research also suggests that the strike serves as a
        significant challenge to neoliberal dominance in higher education,
        advocating for a reevaluation of market-driven practices in academia.
