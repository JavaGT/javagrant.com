    <p>2024/06/12</p>
    <p><p>I’m incredibly proud of my friends <a href="https://www.instagram.com/taiwrightt/">Tai Wright</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/christinavdvelde/">Christina van der Velde</a> on their most recent project(s), <a href="https://www.instagram.com/whakatipumanakai/">Whakatipu Mana Kai</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C6gKisApZ77/">Marama o te wero kai</a>. A natural extension of both their studies in <a href="https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/el-sharp/teaching#:~:text=%2D%20MSc%20(GEOG)%3A%20Tai%20Wright%20%2D%20Indigenous%20Food%20sovereignty">indigenous food soverignty</a> and Te Reo Māori.</p>
<p>As a part of their series of Wānanga, guest speakers <a href="https://www.alternativeendings.co.nz/about">Annette Lees</a> and <a href="https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/sd-wright">Shane Wright</a> shared their respective expertise of the night-time and caring for native New Zealand plants in a-typical conditions for their species! All shared over increible hospitality and kai.</p>
<p>Observing Tai and Christina’s challenge and their growth in this space, as well as the absolute gifts of knowledge they have recieved, shared, and developed with their community is amazing. Such an amazing experience to be a part of. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/whakatipumanakai/">Watch this space!</a></p>

<p>This kaupapa includes three interwoven elements…
• Whakatipu Mana Kai wananga - gatherings to share kai and knowledge
• Awhi ki te taiao - be in good relation with te taiao
• Marama o te wero kai - for the month of May, we’re planning to only eat food from the garden, forest, and ocean</p>
