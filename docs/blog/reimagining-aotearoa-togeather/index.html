    <h1>Reimagining Aotearoa Togeather</h1>
    <p>2024/06/13</p>
    <p><p>Today I attended a hui with the <a href="https://union.org.nz">Council of Trade Unions</a> as a member of the <a href="https://teu.ac.nz">Tertiary Education Union</a>. Called <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reimagining_aotearoa_together/">Reimagining Aotearoa Togeather</a></p>
<p>Was awesome to hear that people are cosidering the future of Aotearoa bottom-up just as I am working to create a space to reconsider the future of our universities bottom-up.</p>
<p>The process was fund and got to talk to people who are very invested in how we can improve our country, particularly for workers. I am particularly fond of the goal of “good work”. Because I’ve done shit work–and it sucks–but I find many forms of work very rewarding and would do it for freeeee (if I could still live).</p>
