    <h1>Theory of Change</h1>
    <p>2024/06/13</p>
    <p><p>Today I attended the second <a href="/blog/tags#Ng%C4%81-Ara-Whet%C5%AB-Advocacy-Workshops">Ngā Ara Whetū (Centre for Climate, Biodiversity and Society) Advocacy Workshops</a> for doctorial students.</p>
<p>Introduced today to the concept of having a Theory of Change.</p>
<p>Had three great speakers; <a href="https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/n-curtis">Neal Curtis</a>, <a href="https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/a-longley">Alys Longley</a>, and <a href="https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/j-frost">Jennifer Frost</a>.</p>
<h1>Connection &amp; Relationships</h1>
<p>The key take-away I had was about how making progress can happen at various scales and the importance of finding the things you can do well, and working collaboratively to make that work useful for others, or working with others directly to develop it into meaningful change.</p>
<p>My current theory of change for my work at the unviersity is one of preparation–establishing networks and communities which care deeply for the institution. By having a network of people who are familiar with one another and have affirmed their mutual respect as carers and nurturers of the idea of the university I hope we will have a network prepared for solidarity when the time comes that it is needed. My PhD work supports this mission, identifying ideas of the university which bring people togeather and can become rallying points directing the future of our universities in Aotearoa.</p>
<p>The key approaches I have to making change at the moment are through collaboration with some university peers, as well as facilitating the <a href="/blog/critical-university-studies-reading-group">Critical University Studies Reading Group</a>. The reading groups has so far been successful in connecting a small cohort accross faculties at the University of Auckland. From discussions today, we hope to expand to include a more diverse group, including more undergraduates and disciplinary backgrounds (currently, it is very sociology &amp; education-heavy).</p>
