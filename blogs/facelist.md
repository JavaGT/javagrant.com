So I got put on google's phishing list, which meant that anyone who came to this site saw a big red screen that warned them I was trying to steal their password.
Thankfully, I've managed to fix that, by putting in alot more effort to my class prject than I would have hoped, anyway you can access this project [here](/facelist/) (try clocking in with "harry" or "frodo")
