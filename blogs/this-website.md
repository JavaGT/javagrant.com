# This website

This site has some pretty neat things going for it.

The creation of this blog is automatic from a folder of markdown (.md) files, with some custom little additions.

[The photography page](/photography) is generated similarly, from a local folder on my computer, lower resolution copies are created for the site, and then they are grouped in the webpage by folder structure, no text file changes needed, simply change the folder structure and run a command to generate the webpage.

The code that makes this site so easy to publish from is available [on github](https://github.com/JavaGT/javagrant.com)!
