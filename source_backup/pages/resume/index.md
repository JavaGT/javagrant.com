#### 🧐 Arts Scholars

[The Arts Scholars programme](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/arts/study-with-us/study-options/arts-scholars.html) has been the defining aspect of my undergraduate experience.

“The Arts Scholars courses consider important subjects in-depth and explore alternate perspectives. Learning and curiosity are the ultimate goal. Also, the people are pretty cool.” - _Java._ {.quote}

During my final year of the programme, I'm undergoing a research project into the educational pedagogy of social science YouTube videos to understand how to effectively use videos for scalable, accessible, and engaging education.

## 🏫 Kerikeri High School

I completed NCEA Level 3 with excellence endorsement, university entrance and a [photography scholarship](#scholarship-%E2%80%94-nzqa-photography).

### 🗺 Leadership

As a KKHS prefect, I worked with career building and pathway discovery for year twelve students. I also represented the school at community and cultural events.

#### 👩‍👦 Peer Support

As a KKHS peer support mentor, I introduced the year seven cohort to the school and made them comfortable in the new learning environment.

#### 🇳🇿 Kiwi Buddy Programme

One of my most rewarding roles was that of Kiwi Buddy. Tasked with making international students welcome in their new school and culture, I befriended 50+ incredible people from all over the world. Directly I was assigned to students from Switzerland, Japan, and the United States.

This programme hugely influenced my life and led me to travel the world in 2018.

# ⚙️ Projects

## 🎨 Art Jam

![Young Creatives at Shore Junction](/static/images/artjam2.jpg){.pad}
I host the YANZ Art Jam on behalf of Youth Arts NZ and in collaboration with [Shore Junction](http://www.shorejunction.nz/). The event was a three-hour social and artistic meet-up for local creatives to develop and collaborate on personal projects in a supportive environment.

## ✏️ Illustrations

I enjoy illustrating things in my downtime. I use Procreate on an iPad to make them happen.

## 🖼 Visualiser.js

I constructed a framework for generating live audio visualisers in the browser. Using JavaScript, the HTML Audio API and HTML canvas, this framework enables anyone with even a small amount of programming knowledge to create an audio visualiser in 2d, 3d or both!
The framework utilises customisable plugins and layers to generate graphics on the fly.

[See on github](https://github.com/JavaGT/Visualiser.js)
