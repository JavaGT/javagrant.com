I'm Matthew Gweiver, and in this edition, I'm looking into the world of private prisons. Radio, Mr. Are you filming? Are you radio in? You're radio and I just... You can interview me if you want. I'm inside Park Prison in South Wales. 25 years ago the UK's first privately run prison opened its doors, following the example of the US. It was a controversial experiment in public policy, allowing profit-making businesses to take charge of locking people up. When I was object today, we introduced the first one, Wals Prison, and it was regarded as a flaming political issue. We had crossed the Rubicon. With that river well and truly crossed, today England and Wales has not only the highest imprisonment rate in Western Europe, but also the highest percentage of prisoners held in private prisons in the world. The plan back in the early 90s was to deliver new modern prisons that could be built quickly, operate cheaply and deliver a better service, forcing failing, overcrowded public prisons to reform. In this program, we ask whether the private sector has fulfilled that promise. GFOS is all about money. It's all about three quarterly month payments from the government to keep us in this prison. Can you say across your estate what your margin is? No. No. Why not? Well because that's for us to know. And we examine how recent riots have brought public attention to privately run institutions. They haven't got no control, they haven't got no discipline with any of their cons in there. So who runs that prison? The boys who's running at the minute or the boys who's got the keys. The primary purpose of a private company is to make money. They are not there for altruistic reasons. Does incarcerating people for profit work, or does it lead the sect to cut corners, sacrificing safety and security in the pursuit of profit? And what are the pioneers over the other side of the Atlantic? We explore the US model. I was stationed in a unit of 350 prisoners, and just me and one other guard were responsible for managing them. First, we need to take a step back to understand why the British government embarked on this experiment with private prisons in the first place. I remember hearing about it and thinking, oh yes, that some bright young spark in a think tank who wants to show just how far outside the box they can possibly think, and it won't survive contact with reality for five minutes, but I couldn't have been more wrong. Julian LeVay is the former finance director of the prison service. Now retired, for years, he held the purse strings to a $2.5 billion prison estate. In other words, all the prison services property and land. In the 1980s, prisons were a public disgrace. Prisoners were held two or three to a cell, which had originally been designed for one, and often held in there for up to 23 hours a day. And in that time, they had to use as a toilet a bucket, which was within inches of somebody's bed. And you can imagine in summer what that is like. The then conservative government looked across the Atlantic for answers. Julian LeVay again. Private prisons had been around in the United States for best part of a decade by then. There was a push and a pull. The pull was a Thatcherite ideology that the private sector would always deliver better and cheaper services. But there was also a very powerful push, which was that the public sector prisons were in an appalling state and seemed incapable of improvement. What was it that the government wanted them to do specifically that was different from the way prisons were in an appalling state and seemed incapable of improvement. What was it that the government wanted them to do specifically that was different from the way public prisons were being run? Amongst the aims that have been suggested was a much quicker building of new prisons, lower running costs, of course, innovation, reducing reoffending, better service all round, and forcing reform in a public sector. That allowed a powerful anarchic and reactionary trade union to effectively take decisions in prisons, particularly on staffing. And so the experiment was born. Competition from the private sector was seen as the answer to reform a dysfunctional system and to win back power from the prison officer's union. Privatization, it was thought, would strengthen the government's hand. The first private prison was opened in 1992. In many respects, the Wals doesn't look all that different from other modern jails. It's built on the principle of separate house blocks, which gives it a less monolithic feel than older establishments and minimizes the impact of any disturbance. Private prisons really took off later in the mid-90s. We've got the fastest, most sustained rise in prisoner numbers in our history. The private sector showed it could build prisons in half the time and half the cost. Today there are 14 prisons contractually managed by private firms in England and Wales and two more in Scotland, accounting for around 15% of the UK prison population. They are run by three multinational companies, G4S, Circo and Sodexo. One of these prisons is G4S's Park Prison in South Wales. It's the second largest prison in the UK, holding up to 1,700 inmates and the only privately operated prison in Wales. As I walk into the communal area of A-block, a modern open planned space with cells towering above me on three floors, one of the first prisoners I meet is choosing his lunch on a touch screen. Simple cheese bagged bag, a tomato wrap, a vegan salad sub, the tuna me and a butter, tomato soup which is powder soup, fresh fruit yogurt, a bit of fruit jelly and a fresh fruit or sorted crisps. It's new technology, unique to the private sector. Personally, I'm a vegan, so... You're vegan? How long have you been a vegan? Five years. Five years is also the sentence he received for drug dealing. When I ask him about the prison and how it compares to other establishments in the public sector, he's pretty forthcoming. GIF is all about money. It's all about three quarterly month payments from the government to keep us in this prison. But Janet Walsgrove, the director of Park Prison, the equivalent to a prison governor in state-run institutions, doesn't see it like that. I don't sit awake at night worrying about the competitive edge from a business point of view. What keeps me awake is what can we do to make the prison safer no matter where you sit, whether you sit in a private sector, whether you sit in a public sector. This is about delivering good, decent, safe regimes that help people and send them back out into the community better than they came in. Janet joined the prison service as a graduate trainee in 1983. She spent most of her career in the public sector before joining Park as director in 2006. I get given my budget, just as if I were in the public sector, I've got a budget to work to. So my job is really making up budget work the best possible way for me. But with one big difference, she says. There's a lot more accountability on me as a private sector director than there was when I worked in the public sector. We have two permanent members of the Ministry of Justice on site. They're called Home Office controllers and they are responsible for monitoring the contract and have got access to anywhere on site and can look at anything that's going on, really. This includes a hefty fine if a single door is left unlocked by one of her staff. Is there anything that you couldn't do in the public sector that you can do here now? Generally, working in the private sector, it gives you a little bit more opportunity to innovate. And I think that you are almost like a chief executive of your business. You have to have an eye on recruitment. You've got to have an eye on commercial issues. If you want to change things, you can do things more swiftly. It gives me some opportunities to run projects, to try things. And if I wanted to stop doing one thing and to try another small project, the company is incredibly supportive of that. And are you a shareholder? No, I'm absolutely not, no. So you're not incentivised any way by share options? That's not what motivates us here. You know, we need to do a job, we'd need to look up to prisons, but no, I'm not. In its most recent inspection of Parks' adult facilities, the Chief Inspectorate of Prisons, the independent body charged with monitoring UK jails, noted high levels of violence and drug use among inmates, but overall found the service to be good and praised the institution for its innovation. One project in particular has gained widespread acclaim. We're now on the family intervention unit which has a markedly different feel from Block A where we were before. Now the idea behind this is that family bonds are used to promote the rehabilitation of fathers in jail and I'm about to go upstairs to meet Jonathan who's serving a sentence for fraud. Hi Jonathan, here's your cell. Welcome to Cell 36 on T4. Jonathan's cell isn't what you might expect. It's more like a modest student's dormitory room with a phone, shower and TV, except it's got barred windows and an industrial lock on one side of a door. The walls are covered in photos of his family. It's as comfortable as it can be here, but we are in prison. We're taken away from our family and society, and we have to deal with that stigma and the shame that we've brought on our family and ourselves. So it is punishment being here, regardless of a television, a kettle, and a PlayStation. Jonathan has been sentenced to 12 years and is expecting to serve six. Thanks to Park's family intervention unit, he's been able to see and interact with his children on a regular basis. They can even come in to do their homework with their father. I've got six children, three older daughters, one of my first marriage, but then three young sons. And I've been on the unit now for two and a half years since October 2014. Now how much easier does it make serving a long stretch like that for you, actually having regular contact with your family then? It's been invaluable. It really has been. It's really the hardest thing imaginable. But each month, if there's a homework club or there's a family day, it just gets us through that month as a family. What difference does it make to you that this is a privately run prison compared to what it might be like if it was an orthodox publicly run institution? Do you think there's a marked difference? There was because I was at Wandsworth prison for several months before I came down here. There's a definite difference in the way the staff are to prisoners, in the facilities available. You know, if you didn't finish school or expelled from schools, you can start again. Those are available in some of the prisons run by the Ministry of Justice, but much less so than some of the private prisons. And your cell here, how does that compare to the one you were in initially in Wonsworth? Well, probably the age of the building. This building is probably 15 years old. Wonsworth was, I think, early 19th century. So it was very little money spent on it. It was very damp. We had cockroaches and rats. It was pretty grim. So how do private prisons compare to prisons run by the state? Turns out it's not that easy to find out. One of the most striking things from my study of the subject is how little effort government has put into answering that question. Julian LeVay again, former finance director of the prison service. In fact, government has not only failed to produce any answer at all to the question of how well is the experiment worked, but has made it more difficult for observers to form their own view by withholding information that you need in order to make comparisons, particularly on costs. Frustrated by a lack of comprehensive data, LeVay took it upon himself in his retirement to pull together all the analysis that's available into a book, competition for prisons, public or private. I think if you take the various aims governments have put forward over the years, there is enough evidence around to bring in a verdict. Quicker building. Yes, the private sector built much more quickly and much cheaper. Operating costs, yes, the private sector runs prisons at much lower cost. The margin between public and private sector in the 90s was about a third. The public sector has narrowed the gap but it hasn't closed it. Quality of service is pretty clear that neither sector has consistently outperformed the other. They both improved in the 2000s, they've both gone to pieces in this decade. The private sector do deserve some credit for developing staff attitudes more respectful of prisoners simply because they recruited people who had never come across prisons before, so they hadn't inherited the kind of punitive culture of the old public sector. His overall conclusion? Although the information is difficult to interpret, I think it's pretty clear that the private sector continue to operate prisons more cheaply than the public sector do. In terms of quality, I don't think there's very much to choose between them. One thing he says has worked in this experiment is reform of the public sector. The threat of competition has helped force reform and improvement in a public sector which, when I was there in the early 1990s was a byword for widespread inefficiency, union obstruction, weak management and appalling quality of service. So if I was trying to persuade the general public that has been worthwhile, I'd say that's been the main benefit. And I suspect that there are those in government who think that competition has done its job. It's had its effect. it's got the prices down, got the staffing down in the public sector, what do you need competition for? But while the private sector may have successfully helped government drive down the cost of state prisons, some believe it was competition that led to a current crisis in UK prisons across the board. Francis Crook, the chief executive of the Howard League for Penal Reform. The deterioration across the prison estate over the past three, four, five years was as a result of the low staffing levels in the private sector prisons, which introduced the idea of benchmarking against them, which has pulled the public prisons down to their level. In her view, private prisons have not driven up standards. In fact, they've driven down against them, which has pulled the public prisons down to their level. In her view, private prisons have not driven up standards. In fact, they've driven down standards. The Justice Secretary has been told repeatedly that the prison she presides over are dangerous and volatile. Richard Bergen, the opposition Labour Party's spokesman on justice, in November 2016. Staff shortages are stark and morale is low and both officers and prisoners alike feel unsafe. He concludes, this is a service in crisis. Like the public sector, in recent years the private sector has also run into trouble. You don't have to look very far to uncover a string of scandals that have caused the sector considerable reputational damage. A riot in a G4S-run prison in Birmingham in central England in December of last year, where inmates seized control of several wings. A BBC undercover report of a private prison run by Sodexo in Northumberland in the north of England revealed widespread drug use, security breaches and a lack of control by prison staff only a few months ago. But perhaps, most damaging of all, in 2013, G4S and Circo were found to have continued to charge for electronic tagging of prisoners even after some had died, left the country or were back in prison. They billed government for £200 million worth of work, which is now admitted they did not do. The serious fraud office must be coming soon to a decision. If the decision is to prosecute, and the prosecution is involved two of the three competitors, it looks to me as though the market's dead. I would have thought it would be very, very difficult to award new contracts to two contractors while a trial is going on in relation to serious fraud by staff employed by those contractors. In fact, since this scandal emerged, no new prison contracts have been awarded to either Circo or G4S. So could this be the end of the road for private prisons in the UK? With such a high-risk business, what's left in it for them? Do the profits make it worth their while? Margins initially were very generous, close to 20% in some cases. Today, it looks to me a pretty unattractive business because prisons, public or private, are sparring right out of control and front of a rise. And the margins, of course, are now very much tighter than they were. Various sources suggest to me that margins are now around 5%. For a business that's so risky, so expensive and difficult to break into, that's not an attractive return. I don't think it's done G4S, Sodexo or Circo, any good being involved in running prisons. When the state takes away somebody's freedom, it is the most awful thing that we can do to a citizen. And for private companies to profit from that, I think, is unethical. I think the privatisation of prisons has run its course. The experiment has not been a success. We should move on. I wanted to get a sense of what the private sector made of these claims, so I went to meet Rupert Soames, the boss of Serco, who run five prisons across the UK. I start by reminding him of a quote by his grandfather, none other than Winston Churchill, speaking in the House of Commons as Home Secretary in 1910. The treatment of criminals is the mark and measure of the stored up strength of a nation. That paragraph is still in the training manual that we use to train custody officers. I think it is the mark and measure of a society is how you look after people who are compelled to be under your care and supervision. What do you say to those people who are very suspicious that the simple idea of outsourcing the prison service and that it's actually fundamentally wrong, what is your answer to those people who don't think there should be any private involvement at all? I think that that has been answered by 25 years of generally successful operation in the UK. So I don't see any difficulty with having private companies being tasked by government and being given a very clear specification of what they are meant to do, being held to account. And on the riots, widespread drug-taking and security breaches? Sometimes prisons go wrong, as they do in the public sector. And they are very difficult communities to pull back. public sector and they are very difficult communities to pull back. So these are complicated and difficult businesses to run, but I think we're all faced by the same issues. Now when you came in to take on the job of running this company, it had suffered considerable reputational damage, hasn't it, dating back to 2013. You were charged by the government for the tagging problems where you were receiving money for something that hadn't been done. How do you anticipate that's going to end up? Well, I have no idea. There is an SFO, serious fraud office inquiry into the events back in 2013, and that will be what it will be. What the public saw was a crisis of confidence from our largest customer, who was the government, who felt very cross, very angry and very severely let down, and with some good reason. The model appears to be on the rocks in the UK, but could there be lessons to be learned from elsewhere? One place where private prisons do seem to be thriving under President Trump's new administration is the US, which pioneered the idea of locking people up for profit. Shane Bauer, a reporter for Mother Jones magazine in the States, spent four months undercover as a prison officer to reveal what goes on inside privately run prisons. In 2014, he filled out an application for the Corrections Corporation of America, or CCA, the country's second largest private prison company. Bauer was surprised at how easily he got a job. I didn't lie in my application. I said who I worked for and I didn't really think that it was going to work. But within a couple weeks, I started getting phone calls from prisons across the country. It felt as though they were trying to convince me to take the job. Shane Bauer accepted a job for $9 an hour in a private prison in Louisiana, which holds a massive 15,000 male inmates. The majority are there for violent crimes. After four weeks of training, he was thrown in at the deep end. I found myself in a situation where I was stationed in a unit of 350 prisoners and just me and one other guard were responsible for managing them. His description of the prison conditions are reminiscent of every prison gang movie you've ever seen. They were, for the most part, housed in dorms of about 44 men. They spent most of the day in those dorms. The toilets are in the open, the showers are in the open. They're just kind of living on top of each other 24 hours a day. All this stuff comes down to efficiency. And by efficiency, I mean, in the cost sense. You know, it's cheaper to have a giant room where 40-some guys each have a bed You know, it's cheaper to have a giant room where 40-some guys each have a bed in a locker than it is to have a bunch of cells. The guard towers were empty. There used to be guards in the towers, but the company cut those positions to save money. And while it was there, someone escaped in the middle of the day. One of the things that people might find extraordinary is that CCA and the other prison companies actually have got written occupancy guarantees in these contracts. Oh yeah, I mean, the company gets paid per diem rate. So for every prisoner, they get a fee at this prison. It was $34. So they want to keep the prison full for sure. But like you said, the contracts generally have occupancy guarantees. So if the prison is below 96% capacity, they're still going to be paid, which means taxpayers are still going to be paying for the incarceration of people that aren't even there. A few weeks after Shane's story came out in August 2016, the US Department of Justice released a report comparing private and public prisons at the federal level and found that they were more violent and offered less opportunities for rehabilitation. The Department of Justice then announced that they are going to discontinue their use of private prisons. However, during his presidential campaign, Donald Trump made it clear that if he got the top job, he would expand private prisons. And on the morning of his surprise victory, CCA's stock price skyrocketed and the Attorney General announced that he is reversing the Obama era decision to stop using private prisons. So that has essentially been canceled and we're back to where we started. It seems that in 2017, the pioneer of private jails has few lessons to offer the rest of the world. Back in the UK, public or private, one thing is for sure, the system at the moment isn't working. There's widespread agreement that the prison service has reached crisis point, with overcrowding, violence, self-harm and drug abuse rife. And worse, currently 46% of all prisoners will re-offend within a year of release. The British government shows a little sign of getting prison numbers down from record levels. Indeed, it's recently announced plans for four new super-sized prisons as part of its commitment to build up to 10,000 modern prison places by 2020 at a cost of $1.7 billion. In a statement, the Ministry of Justice in London told us that privately run prisons play an important role in the estate and that decisions on who will operate the new prisons have yet to be made. But hopes are not high that the private sector will get a look in with new contracts. Maybe now they have forced cost down, they've done their job, and the experiment will be wound up.
