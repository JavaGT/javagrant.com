Well, I've gone back to pedal power. Not that I have to say I'm very good at it. It is, however, part of my attempts to do things a little differently and a little better, I suppose, and of course to keep off public transport during the pandemic. Now it's forced me to realize I can make a change to my routine that's good for me, it also happens to be good for the planet as well. Now the COVID crisis and the resulting economic recession has led to widespread calls to recognize that we now have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to rethink how we can put the economy back together and whether we can do it, of course, in a more environmentally friendly way. So, in this program, that's exactly what we're trying to find out, how we can build back better. The first stop, I suppose, is to find someone with a plan and you'll have to excuse the panting. I said, I'm on my bike. I think so I was any good at it. to excuse the panting. I said, I'm on my bike. I think so I was any good at it. The United Kingdom and in fact the world finds itself in a time of unprecedented economic hardship. That requires significant government investment to enable a recovery. Brian O'Callaghan is one of the authors of an Oxford University report into how to build back better. It's the phrase of the moment and means rebuilding an economy that is both greener and fairer. In this program, we'll be focusing on the environment. We found that green-type initiatives outperformed traditional alternatives on both economic and environmental characteristics. In other words, their research claims that investing in environmentally sustainable recovery projects creates more jobs, produces more profit per pound spent, and saves the government money all at the same time. So, what kind of policies will help with our green recovery? One idea is encouraging more cycling and building bike lanes. The advantage many claim is not just environmental. A report by Transport for London quotes research which claims encouraging walking, cycling and public space improvements can increase retail sales by 30% as consumers can spend more time shopping. It says that £1 spent on walking or cycling projects delivers £13 of benefit to the economy. Okay, and before we set off, always good to check your tyre pressure. Creating more bike lanes would create more construction jobs and could help a whole new industry bloom, that of electric bikes. I've come to meet Tom McPhail, whose company is primed to take advantage. That should do it. So Tom, tell me about the business. A pure electric was founded around two years ago with the express purpose of decarbonising transport, providing the means for millions of people to travel around the country without causing environmental damage. So we sell electric bicycles, electric scooters, and partly as a consequence of lockdown, and partly because the demand already existed were growing at a phenomenal rate. Well, you very kindly are gonna lend me a bike today. This one right in front of me, it is called a cargo bike, never heard of that. What is a cargo bike? It's a bike for carrying goods, so typically they'll carry up to a couple of hundred, maybe 250 kilos of goods. You've got an electric motor, so it makes it easy to ride. It's very like riding an ordinary bicycle. You've got the same brakes, same gears, the pedals. But that electric motor makes it feel like you're crisproo. You can pedal those goods around the city without getting too tired. Right, so this bike is going to perform a miracle. It's going to make me look good. That's amazing. And the cargo goes on the back, it looks like here. So on this one, yes, you've got the cargo goes on the back it looks like here. So on this one yes you got a cargo rack on the back that can be have child seats on there if you want you can also put a rack on the front to carry goods on the front as well. Okay we're going to give it a go see if it does really make you look good. Let's go let's go. So I just like it and it just decides you will feel the motor kick in as soon as you start to pedal. Okay, lovely. Yeah, about aggressive drivers. Okay, I think we're good. Okay, right, heading off forward. It's a bit difficult when it starts. I'm going to get a bit of motor assistance any second, I think. Come on, motor assistant, maybe I'm in the wrong gear. But feels like something's happening now oh no it is I turn it off let's don't know what I'm doing oh no I just turned my I thought to turn the engine off I just turned my monitor off something's off it says off God knows what's off I'm doing okay know what I'm doing. Okay. Just try to select the right gear. Not sure I'm doing that particularly well. There we are. It just starts to show how unfit I am. So I'm just checking, I can't have turned off the battery. The battery... You might turn the power off. Okay, so that's why I'm just checking, I can't have turned off the battery. The battery... You might turn the power off. Okay, so that's why I'm saying... Suddenly it feels a bit stronger. Okay, so now I'm going to feel the difference of the actual battery. Oh my goodness, yes. That's much easier. Just try pushing the... Can you see the plus button up and left? Yeah. Try moving it up to a more powerful setting. Oh! Tom! I'm flying! Tour mode. Right, okay, let's have a look. Sports mode. Oh, I can feel it. We're going. Doesn't have a supersonic mode. It does's called turbo look at that we need to slow down hold a second oh oh so before we have a chat tom i'm going to regain my breath right so just taught me through this bike then that i'm going along i mean the obvious difference is I've got a little chip meter here which seems to have lots of power switches. So explain to me what is basically different about the bike I'm riding to a normal one. It's defined as an electrically assisted pedal cycle. You have to pedal to make the motor work, but when you start pedaling, the motor will deliver power to the wheels to help you along. So if you're in this case carrying a cargo on the back or if you're trying to get up a hill, it will help you get that. Right. This classifies as a hill, doesn't it? You know, for me, Tom, this classifies as a hill. We're a Regent's Park, Adam. It's not a big hill. Okay, all right, fair enough. All right. So it can carry fairly substantial cargo. But crucially, so if you want to get stuff around the city, if you want to deliver goods to shops, if you want to deliver goods to customers, the idea of last mile deliveries, so you could have large amounts of freight delivered to hub points, either by road or by rail, and then unloaded from there and then distributed from there on cargo bikes so that you take the vans and the cars out of the city. So do you think this actually has the potential to make a big difference to small businesses doing these deliveries or is this, I mean it's even like maybe large delivery companies? Absolutely so we're running trials with some large delivery companies at the moment, and we fully expect to see the big delivery companies embracing this kind of technology. If you think that a typical cargo bike will cost low thousands of pounds, but, of course, the running costs are very, very low. You've got no fuel costs, you've got no road tax costs, you've got almost no spare parts costs relative to a conventional car. So not only does it cost less money to buy, but your operating costs are far lower. And for small businesses, the big appeal as well is that your delivery times will be pretty much the same as with a car. In fact, very often in London, particularly, you'll be quicker on a bicycle than you would in a car. Right. Once you pause, I'm just going to put this into tall mode. Give me a bit of a bit more boost up here. I mean, I can see why all of this is good for the environment. What difference do you think it makes to the economy? Well, the government has this legal obligation to be carbon neutral by 2050, that's already set in stone. In order to achieve that, it has to change our transport habits, so that means building out cycling infrastructure, and it means encouraging people to ditch the car and buy bicycles. So that creates retail activity and it creates construction activity, all of which will stimulate the economy at a time when we desperately need that. So we've taken a little break because our producer, Phoebe, seems to have broken a rather expensive bike. I think a couple of grand. She claims she didn't break it. It just happened to stop working while she was cycling it, which is an interesting spin on things. It's not big brake. It's just wobbly handlebars. And Tom, the amazing Tom, has got a tool which is fixing it all. So we'll be on our way. We'll just do an edit here and you'll hear me back on the road. Thank you. Environmentally, of course it's good if lots of people ditch their cars and go on ordinary bikes. What difference does the battery-assisted bike make to that? We know that physical inactivity is costing the NHS billions of pounds a year. It's estimated at nearly eight billion pounds a year. An electric bicycle works particularly well for people who perhaps not been doing any physical exercise for a while, maybe older people, pensioners, people who are perhaps a bit overweight at the moment, who might be daunted at the prospect of riding a conventional bicycle. For them, the battery power, the assistance, the help getting up hills, just makes all the difference. They're still getting exercise, but it's not quite such a daunting prospect. Everybody wins. You're right, you know what? My brother-in-law is a super keen cyclist and keep saying I should go out with him and there's no way I go out with him because I go within five minutes, I would be, I just, I mean, I'd just be two miles behind you, but here I feel like I could go go out I could almost not tell him because it's not immediately obvious just hope he's not listening to this and then I'll come up for ride with him next week and you'll be impressed with your physical prowess what happened to you Adam I know it's this lockdown exercise you're working hard in lockdown yeah that's what it is nothing to do with the battery it's all Adam's thighs that's what it is. Nothing to do with the battery. It's all Adam's thighs. That's where the magic lies. Of course, there are always dangers in putting huge numbers of inexperienced cyclists on the road like me. Partly to help reduce those risks, building back better will include investments in a huge number of new cycle lanes and wider pavements. And what is needed in those and in other construction projects is a lot of concrete. Few would consider concrete a glamorous industry. It's just one of those things which surround us, but to which we give little thought. And there's a problem with concrete, one that Conor O'Rean at Ecosem is trying to solve. Concrete is the most consumed substance on earth after water. For every person on earth, there is a cubic metre which is about two tons of concrete poured every year on earth. Now, the carbon footprint of concrete principally comes from the manufacture of the cement, which is the element that allows us to bind all the ingredients of concrete together. Now, cement is responsible for up to 8% of CO2 emissions. And this is a huge impact on the environment, a huge impact on global warming. So it's something that we obviously have to do something about if we want to reduce our impact on global warming. So it's something that we obviously have to do something about if we want to reduce our impact on the environment. It's worth repeating that cement is responsible for 8% of all the world's carbon emissions. If it were a country, its emissions would be the third largest in the world, only behind China and the USA. So Conner's company has come up with a product called Ecosem, an alternative cement. So a big truck has just arrived. Explain what is going on. Well, this is 30 tons of the world's most environmentally friendly cementitious material arriving. The truck driver is connecting the pressurized truck which will be able to then blow the Ecosem product to the top of the silo. So I would say would you say that's about 20, 30 meters high? Yeah, about that very high. In this truck there are 30 tons of Ecosem that will be used to replace 30 tons of traditional cement. Now if you take the carbon footprint of EcosEM being 40 times less than that of traditional cement, this truck is saving almost 30 tons of CO2 emissions. The reason for that is that to make traditional cement, the first part of the process is to get your raw material, which is to quarry limestone. The second part of that process is to cook that limestone at very high temperatures. So there we have two sources of CO2. The carbon that's contained in the limestone that will be released during the cooking process. And then we have the second cause of CO2, which will be the energy needed to get that limestone up to the temperatures needed. So that's between 1,500 and 1,500 degrees. So 10 times more than you need to cook a pizza oven. Okay. And you've managed to get round that process. Well, we replace the limestone with a byproduct from the production of steel. So we buy that off the steel industry and do a minimum amount of processing. The carbon footprint of our product is 16 kilos at the end of its lifespan versus the 7 to 800 kilos of traditional cement. It's a lovely idea, isn't it? Using waste product from one industry to actually create a new industry. Love it or hate it, and that's exactly what Marmite does, isn't it? It's the waste product of the brewing industry to create, what I think is a fabulous spread. Well, I'm on the hate side of that argument on my brain. We'll have that argument later. So we've come into the building. Fabulous spread. Well, I'm on the hate side of that argument. I'm afraid. We'll have that argument later. So we've come into the building. It's very dark, huge amounts of machinery around us. We feel almost as if we're in the machine here. Explain to me what's going on. Now, if you can picture a giant kind of washing machine on each side of us, those washing machines are fed with all the different elements that make up the concrete and then they're spun around mixed for a prescribed specific amount of time and then they'll be dropped down into the manufacturing process underneath. And we can hear that happening right now so the mixer has just stopped and so that liquid is going to leave the floor we're on and go to the level below now. Exactly. So the minute you add water to the cement the concrete process starts hardening so we have to work within a certain time scale because we don't want the concrete to get too hard before we've actually managed to manufacture the pieces that were that we're making in this factory so there's a clock ticking right now the clock is ticking okay and so we better keep up with the cement where does it go from here exactly let's follow it down well we're going down some very steep metal steps, which is taking us from those big mixing machines all the way down to the factory floor and I'm being very, very careful so that I don't trip. It's a sort of willy wonker of cement this factory., machines going everywhere, wild staircases, mixing machines. I just need a crazy man and a top hat. So now that concrete is being turned into bricks. Every 12 seconds we're making a new wrap of bricks. I can just see them coming out of the oven, little brakes. And what's this pile here? Well, this is the blocks that haven't quite made it. Unfortunately, they weren't good enough to make it to the yard. I can't actually tell why this one hasn't passed the inspection. But if you look at the other ones, they are kind of cracked and black stone. Your stronger arms than mine, I thought that was lighter. I'm trying to get that one to the radio. Look at that. I picked it up. Oh my goodness, okay. I don't know if you can hear how heavy this is. Hold on. No. I tell you, it's a lot heavier than that sound. There we are. That's how heavy that is. I'm not, I'm not that, but you're a strong man. Anyway, there's another reject block coming on its where I can see an unloved bit of cement there it goes onto the cement heap it is a bit like grown-up Lego and they've all left so I can play I can I can build myself with a tutor train out of rejected concrete bricks. More environmentally friendly cement could be very important in the construction of new projects. But actually trying to improve what we've already got can be a lot more economically and environmentally efficient than building something from scratch. So another path to a greener economic recovery is all about the road to retrofitting and replacing. In his summer statement, the Chancellor Rishish Sunak agreed to invest £2 billion in grants to make properties more energy efficient, with help towards the cost of insulation and other energy improvements. There's a specific grant aimed at lower-income households, which should not only help reduce carbon emissions, but reduce social inequality, by cutting energy bills for those most in need of help. Econic is a business that hopes to benefit from that renewed retrofitting market with a new kind of insulation made from a more ecologically friendly kind of plastic. We're focused on the polyurethane industry and polyurethanes are used in a vast range of products. That's insulation in our homes and offices. It's insulation in appliances like refrigerators. It's used in memory foam for mattresses, in foam in most of the furniture that we're used to, the soles of our running shoes. So a massive array of materials with very different properties in different applications. That's Rowena Sellon's Econics Chief Executive. How has her product changed the way these plastics are made? The best way to describe these types of products, these plastics, is like a string of beads. And if you imagine the old way, every individual bead is an oil-based chemical unit. With our technology, we're enabling the manufacturers to replace every other bead in that chain with a unit of waste carbon dioxide. It's chemically bound in there. It's not floating around. It won't escape. We're reusing, recycling that carbon in that waste carbon dioxide into the chain of those beads. They're taking waste carbon dioxide, which causes global warming, and locking it into their product. And in the process, they're reducing the harmful carbon emissions of other industries. So by reducing the amount of oil-based chemicals that we need to use, you don't have to drill for that oil. That's a huge benefit to the planet. And in this one product area alone, it's the equivalent of taking millions of cars off the road a year if this technology is adopted and used. It's often the case that a more environmental option is more expensive. Is that the case with you? No, it's not. That material, even once captured, is still significantly lower cost than the oil-based materials that it's replacing. So really, a win-win. So there is a realistic opportunity for a revolution here. That's not too big a word for it. I think you're right. It is a revolution. And I think to resolve the climate crisis, we need a number of revolutions of different scale throughout all areas of industry, as well as our personal lives. So we do hope this will lead the way and be a positive example that creates the momentum for others to make change. Building with more environmentally friendly cement or improving insulation are very visible ways of trying to create a greener economic recovery. But perhaps less immediately obvious is what's going on in the world of big money investing. My name is Sarah Melvin and I lead BlackRock's business in the UK. BlackRock is the largest professional investment company in the world. It controls huge amounts of money and our pension funds and how successful companies like it are will largely determine how much people's pensions are worth. What it does with its billions of pounds of assets also has huge influence on the shape of the world economy. Removing investments from polluting industries puts pressure on them to change their ways, whilst investing in environmentally friendly industries gives them the capacity to expand. How significant a role, therefore, do investors like BlackRock have in creating a greener economy? I think we have a very positive contribution to make to the recovery and to the recovery being sustainable. What's very clear to us is that climate risk is an investment risk. What that means is that if climate change damages the environment, it also damages a company's ability to operate properly. In other words, as well as an ecological concern, climate change puts the economy in peril. As a result, this year BlackRock made a huge change in the way it does business and how it invests its billions. Traditionally, when we're selecting companies to invest in and add to our portfolios, we would assess things like profit and loss. We'd look at their balance sheet. We'd look at the strength of their board. We are now assessing climate risk as part of that assessment as well. So we're applying a score to companies based on our views of how sustainable their companies are. So if, for example, it's a manufacturing company, we would look at the carbon emissions from their transportation, we would look at their energy management and bizarre last resort, we've actually voted against management. And we did that at a range of companies this year on climate votes at Exxon or Volvo or Lufthansa. So-called ethical investing has been around for a long time. But in the past, many have feared that to be green, investors have had to accept lower profits. BlackRock research shows that's no longer the case and that at the start of this year, sustainable investments did better than traditional ones. Of course, if you're right, if this is actually just a good way of investing and making money for everyone, surely soon everyone will be doing this. We have seen an enormous shift in client demand towards sustainable investing. In the first quarter of this year, we have seen really unprecedented flows. So if you look at, for example, the clients who've invested into sustainable funds in the first quarter of this year, it was about £33 billion, which is over a 40% increase on last year. So we're seeing a real sea change in demand, and I think quite a profound shift. And I think globally we can expect billions, if not trillions of pounds, to move to more sustainable investing. Even BlackRock is still investing in fossil fuels through some of its tracker investment funds, where it's impossible to avoid such companies. But their turn towards more environmentally friendly investments clearly marks a significant change in approach and one being taken by many others in the finance industry as well. There's no doubt that the pause created by the COVID crisis gives us an opportunity to rethink what sort of economy and society we wish to rebuild. But what's at stake if we go back to business as usual? Economist Brian O'Callaghan from Oxford University again. If we support the status quo now and we pump more investment into supporting the economic system as it stands today. Our trajectory continues as before. That trajectory is not one that reaches our net zero emissions targets and it's one that quite frankly puts the British population at risk, at risk of the harmful implications of climate change. The second part is that if we don't spend now on these green initiatives, I'm not sure when we will. Because coming out of this pandemic, budgets would have been stretched quite thinly. And so in some ways, the question is if we're going to spend now and versus if we're going to spend at all. Well, I'm back on my battery powered bike. I've got to say this is not something I'd have ever tried before the crisis. And I think I think I might just keep it up. Now the recession, of course, that we're facing will need to be dealt with. But our government has a choice. Will they choose to return to business as usual? Or will they take this opportunity to help new shoots flourish into a greener economy? The world of business was presented by Adam Shaw and produced by me, Phoebe Kean. And don't worry, I didn't actually break the bike. Sorry again, Tom."}
