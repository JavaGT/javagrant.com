This podcast is supported by advertising outside the UK. BBC Sounds, music, radio, podcasts. Flight shame. It's a thing. If you are suffering from it and are considering doing something about it, then you've come to the right place. In this episode of the World of Business, we'll tell you where your money goes if you choose to the right place. In this episode of the world of business, we'll tell you where your money goes if you choose to offset your flight. There are lots of projects to choose from, but we've focused on a project that protects forests in Zimbabwe in southern Africa. I'm the producer Phoebe Keene, and when I got there, I couldn't believe how beautiful it was. The forests are absolutely stunning and well worth protecting. But how does it all work? Here's Charlotte Ashton. Oh, sorry, you're all right. Let's take this big spiky palm leaf out the way. I'm fighting my way through a forest in Zimbabwe. Thorny bushes, golden spiky grasses, Mopani trees with leaves shaped like the wings of a butterfly. The colour of these leaves is so vivid. It's almost lying green. And every now and then you get these fantastic palms. What sort of... Oh, ow, sorry. I just got a spike. This journey began when I started thinking seriously about my carbon footprint. The problem is, we live here in Zimbabwe. Our friends and family are in the UK. Sailing back to see them is not an option. We've got two small children and neither the time nor money to spend three weeks at sea each way. If we want to see our family, we need to fly. So I'm looking into offsetting, buying carbon credits that cancel out the damaging greenhouse gases released by my flight. It's been criticised as a distraction from the real work of reducing what we emit in the first place. But for those of us with no other option, I want to understand the business model. Which is why I'm in this forest with Rory Mule. He's project's area manager for a company called Carbon Green Africa, who produce carbon credits. This bird song really is fantastic. What can we hear right now? There was a cuckoo calling a lot. There you go. That's a cuckoo. Really? He heard you. And then there's a lot of white-brought sparroweas. Yeah, they're the ones that nest on the western side of trees. Oh, okay. So is that there sort of a compass then? You know what you're going? Yeah, it's a guide's question. If you have a overcast day and you're on flatland, how do you determine a direction? And that is one of the answers. Rory and I are walking a very specific distance through the trees. My seat alone on a return flight from Harari to London leads to 3.4 tonnes of carbon dioxide getting pumped into the atmosphere, trapping heat leading to global warming. That's the same amount of carbon stored in little over one hectare of this type of forest. Okay, hectares 100 metres by 100 meters. Uh-huh. It's not going to be quick. You pick the best route. We've got a little bit of a ravine. Jump across here. Okay, we made it. 100 meters to the top of the hill. That's one side of a hectare. There's still the other three sides. It takes this amount of trees to remove the carbon that I emit on my own as one passenger on the flight back to London. Okay, there's four of us. We're a family of four. That's quite a lot of forest. Yeah, it is. That's huge. In the biggest scheme of things, that is huge. Yeah, yeah. How many planes are in the sky at one time? In this program, we're going to find out how a business like carbon green Africa turns the carbon stored in these trees into a carbon credit. One ton of carbon absorbed and stored by the trees equals one carbon credit. So I need to buy 3.4 credits to neutralise the damage done by my flight. One ton of carbon is equal to one credit. We sell those carbon credits for money. And how much does that cost at the moment? How much do I need to spend to get one carbon credit? You are looking at that part, say you $1.50. Charles Andondo is the general manager at Carbon Green Africa. So what do they do with the money I spend on carbon credits? Well, first things first, they don't plant new trees. These types of forests, if you come up and you see like this tree, how big it is, this tree must have been near for almost over 100 years. So it means it's storing quite a lot of carbon dioxide that is actually taking off from the atmosphere. But they are getting into threat. Right. So this type of forest is under threat in this part of Zimbabwe. Precisely so. The wall of Zimbabwe is losing about 330,000 hectares of this forest every year. So if no one actually takes a position to try and preserve these natural forests, we head in towards the desert. 330,000 hectares of forest. That's an area the size of Cornwall, lost every year in Zimbabwe alone. The Carbon Green Africa business is about protecting those mature trees that suck up and store so much carbon. Scientists say that halting deforestation is critical if we're going to limit global temperature rise to no more than 2 degrees. The United Nations mechanism for doing this is called Red Plus. That stands for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation. The plus bit denotes added benefits for the local community. Carbon Green Africa runs the biggest project of this type in the world. They call it Cariba Red Plus. Charles and Rory are going to show me how it works. We hit the road with our translator Kuzai. The project covers a huge swath of northern Zimbabwe. It's vast. You'd need two days to drive from one side to the other. We've stopped in a village called Machemwa, which is a collection of small round brick-thatched homes, arranged in clusters, one for each family. There's a fire pit in the middle and a hen coop. There's a load of goats running middle and a hen coop. There's a load of goats running around and chickens plucking away. And I'm standing in the shade very gratefully because it's so hot, the shade of a Mpani tree where some children and women are sitting around talking. There's a lady braiding her daughter's hair and some other women who've obviously returned from church. They're all dressed in white. I'm going to go and have a word with them. There are many reasons people here cut down trees. But the main one is so-called shifting agriculture. That's when farmers move fields every few years because the soil has become infertile. Kariba Red Plus teaches farmers how to keep the soil good so they don't need to move. Through Kariba Red, we were taught to farm digging holes in our land, which is called conservation farming, because every time we farmed, our crop would die and die all the time. Precious Muzenghazer is a small holder farmer. Instead of planting her seeds in plant, our crop would die and die all the time. Precious Muzenghasa is a smallholder farmer. Instead of planting her seeds in plowed ridges, the team has taught her to dig dinner plate-sized holes which trap the rain and prevent topsoil washing away. Then they add cow dung and mulch, that's old sticks and leaves, to provide nutrients and trap moisture. And what difference have you noticed now that you've switched to conservation farming? Pama'amagery, my own conservation farming. I've got a few people, because of my own, I said it. Since we started conservation farming, we had a filled day, and that year we got 19 bills of cotton, 15 bags of small grains. Wow. Okay, so it's making a difference? There's a huge difference. We no longer farm one piece of land and then move to the other. So now we can farm on the same piece of land to keep the soil intact with nutrients. And before when you had to move, were you cutting down trees to get new land? Yeah, yes, wherever we went, when there was trees and weeds would cut them and then bring them at the same time. Not everybody in the village has moved to conservation farming. How many children do you have? Oh, you are a brave lady. which has moved to conservation farming. How many children do you have? One, eight. Oh, you are a brave lady. You are stronger than me. What do you grow? What did you plant in your field? Last year I farmed a maze and I did not get anything at all. We are experiencing hunger. Right now we are struggling as a family. The consequences of climate change remain abstract for many of us. But here in Zimbabwe, hotter, drier weather means food isn't growing. It's making life even harder in a country reeling from economic crisis. Millions of parents are struggling to feed their children. Pada, Zai, what's going to pay this? What's happened here, Rory? Okay, this guy's cutting a field and he's cut the tree down and it's fallen in the road. So is this shifting agriculture in action? Absolutely. This is all brand new fields here. Really? Yeah. So they're cutting these trees down to make way for new fields, new soil. Gosh, you really see, watching these guys drag these lovely hardwood trees out you see that that must have been old that tree that's the big one yeah yeah so this yeah i mean there's a huge old tree trunk just fallen down here it's obviously cut down and then burned yeah totally wasted just to clear his field now his only source of energy here is Now his only source of energy here is wood. His only source of energy. But he's burning it. And his wife now is going to have to go and walk three kilometres to go and find firewood for dinner tonight. Yet, meters from the house, he's burning down big old trees. Just makes you realize the scale of the challenge here, isn't it? Yeah, it is. It's huge. It's huge. It's absolutely huge. Tons and tons and tons of tree disappearing through our very eyes. Yeah. Literally. Another major cause of deforestation in this region is fire, naturally occurring, but also started by poachers who burn the trees to drive the animals out. Often they lose control of the fires, so Cariba Red Plus use revenue from carbon credits to train and equip firefighting teams. And then there's the need for firewood, for curing tobacco, for keeping warm and for cooking. At one local hospital alone, they were cutting down six hectares of trees. That's nine football pitches every year just to keep the kitchen going. So Charles's team spent carbon credit money on an alternative. We've got a big basin of cow dung here which surprisingly doesn't smell. Cahdang doesn't smell. I didn't expect that? Yeah, so it's a metal mixing it. Just like what I'm doing. And then, just put in your water. Just take the cow dung down and throw it into the fiddle. Then, just put in your water. Just take the cow dung down and throw it into the feeders slot. They've installed a biogas digester. It uses manure to produce methane gas that then powers the ovens in the kitchen. The hospital has even started accepting cow dung as payment from patients who couldn't otherwise afford treatment. A maternity ward. How many patients do you have here, Dr. Magotty? Currently we have five patients. Makadu, a little girl. Hello. What, five patients? Makadu, I'm a little girl. Hello. It's a tiny, tiny baby girl. I think that little lady's crying because she's waiting to be fed. Her mother's had twins and the other one is feeding. That's why. Mara-di, hello. Oh, what old is I'm going? The biogast digestive that we've just seen, what difference has that made here to the hospital for you from a doctor's perspective? Yeah, it's really important that our sick patients here get food, especially those three meals per day. It helps in their recovery. But is the financing of the hospital difficult? Is it a challenge? Yes, it's a challenge. It's difficult to get all the things that we need. It has saved us a lot of money on firewood because the cost of getting that firewood was high. So with the money we are saving on firewood, we can have more money to buy drugs for these little babies and their mothers. The journey to our next stop takes us north through kilometres after kilometre of beautiful Miombo woodland, we stopped with Mya the view. Just making our way to the edge of the to the edge of this little view point and gosh what a view. It really is splendid. To my left is a sweeping range of mountains coming in across there in Zambia, covered in this beautiful lime green carpet of trees. And in front of me is the wide river valley, with the Luangua coming in, meandering its way in from Zambia, meeting the Zambizi, which sweeps round to the right into Mozambique. It really is beautiful. And Rory, you've been working in this part of the world for your whole life, haven't you, for all your career? Yes, since 1989 I've been up here. And has this view changed in that time? The big changes here are the wildlife populations really. They've dwindled dramatically. In the early 90s there were free-range rhino here. Plenty. Yeah, we used to encounter rhino probably three times a week. Really? Yeah, absolutely. And are there any here now? Nothing, not week. Really? Absolutely. And are there any here now? Nothing, not one. Really? And what about other wildlife? The other... Even the other big four, the buffalo, elephant, lion, leopard, even they've dwindled a lot because their habitats have been encroached. And their habitat is the forest? Yeah, yeah. And it's gone. Rural Zimbabwe is among the poorest places on earth. People are desperate for jobs. Cariba Red Plus are harnessing that need for a good livelihood as an incentive to protect the trees. To find out how we've come to visit Nelson, who's got a new job as a beekeeper. One can die from bee stings, so it's a dangerous job. Do you get stung all over? In the hands, but I'm used to eat now. Oh, gosh, okay, it's not for the faint-hearted. Bees mean honey which Nelson can sell. The pollen the bees use comes from flowers on the trees. No trees, no honey. No honey, no money. My life has changed. With the money I'm left with, I can now buy other things in the city. I can manage to pay school fees for my children and buy food for my family. Okay, and how many children do you have? Three. Money used to be a problem for me, but now it's easier. Now that you're earning a lot more money, money that's coming from the forest, has it changed the way that you see the trees? It's changed the way you view the forest? Yes, it has changed my way of thinking on trees. Long back, people used to come and cut down trees. But now I stop people cutting down trees because I want to look for a strong and healthy tree to continue with the beekeeping. I really say you're literally going up to your fellow villagers and saying, stop, don't cut it down, I can hang a hive in there. They now know I do not tolerate people coming to cut down trees and burning down trees because I now protect trees. So you've become the kind of tree bee man, the tree bee guy? Yes, they know me as the tree protector, the beekeeper. To get a better price for his honey, Nelson puts it in a 25-litre bucket and carries it on his head for three hours to the shores of the Zambezi River. The boats are coming in across the river, 300 meters or so from Zambia, across the mighty Zambizi. They call them banana boats because they are shaped just like bananas, a long canoe. And this guy's got a load of fish. Tiger fish, I think, quite big. He's showing his catch of the day to a lady who's looking to buy. The river's calm, full of crocodiles and hippos, I'm told, so we're keeping a safe distance from the edge. At first we would cross to Zambia and sell to anyone. But as time went on, we started having relations with the University of Luanga and Luanga High School. And that's when we started selling to the local university and the high school. Is it a good business? Yeah, that's a real rate. At the moment, yes. So, now I know where my money goes when I buy a Kariba Red Plus carbon credit. It's spent on helping people earn money from the forests, on providing them with alternatives to chopping down trees. And it's bringing this remote corner of Zimbabwe into a global market, providing them with new income. The business pays nearly a third of revenue from the sale of their carbon credits directly to district councils in exchange for permission to operate. Cash for local services. Central government gets nothing. It's an incentive to protect the forest, as Charles explains. They realise that they can earn revenue or income out of it, which has made the business model actually successful. We managed to show them that there's far much better value that they can derive from this forest. It's late now and we're back at the camp, sitting looking up at this blanket of bright stars, stretches all the way down to the horizon. Listening to the night-time sounds of the forest just coming alive. And after everything we've seen and learnt on our journey with the Kariba Red Plus team, climate change and the climate change struggle really has never felt so immediate. It's a new day and our mission is to understand how all that work to reduce deforestation is turned into a carbon credit that I can buy online. Well first they need to measure how much forest they've saved. Okay so basically an independent verifier auditor will give us the randomly selected GPS points. Rory heads off carrying a tape measure. Within the nine-meter circle, whatever occurs in there, whether it's six inches tall or 30 metres tall, we record that tree. Every year they count and measure the trees at plots which are representative of the whole project area. Charlotte, can you take that? Keep going. I'll stop you at nine meters. Keep going. I'll stop you at 9 metres. Oh, run out. It's going to take my run out. Okay, so should I bang this peg in to the ground here? Yep, yeah. Okay. This allows them to work out how many trees they've lost this year and compare that to how many trees would have been lost if the project didn't exist. The difference between the two tells them how many trees they've saved. In the case of Zimbabwe's Miombo forest, for every one hectare of forest saved, 2.9 tons of carbon are stored, and that means 2.9 credits. Then when the auditor arrives, he will select which plots he wants to go. We are not pre-informed of any plot prior to their arrival. This whole process is overseen by one of a handful of international bodies that issue carbon credits. In this case, VCS, the verified carbon standard. They confirm the project is working to a United Nations framework and has been verified by an independent auditor. It's a seal of approval that the whole thing isn't a scam. We submit all the data to the auditor who then submits it to VCS and VCS, validates it and issues the credits. So it'd be pretty difficult to fake a carbon credit. It's impossible. It's impossible because if they pick up a discrepancy, they will immediately put a stop to everything. If all the boxes are ticked, VCS issues the carbon credits. Each one has a unique number, so they can't be sold twice. Carbon Green Africa then hands them over to another company called South Pole, who do the sales and marketing. So South Pole has sold more than 170 million of tons of carbon. Christian Danica is a senior expert in forestry at South Pole. That is about equal to the emissions of the US state of New York in one year. Christian was part of the South Pole team that helped get Carriva Red Plus certified, and I've got a list of burning questions for him. First up, the measuring process, which is all based on the assumption that a certain deforestation rate would have continued if carbon green Africa hadn't set up the Cariba Red Plus projects. Isn't that just pure guesswork? This is by default a little bit counterintuitive, because the project is having an impact on the area, of course. So to take a historical average deforestation rate from an area that is socio-economically infrastructure-wise and so on, similar to the project area, is probably as good as it can get. I'm personally convinced that the carbon science around Red Project has advanced a lot in the last years. I mean, both satellite imagery and on the groundwork have been improving quite a bit. Next up, the price. South Pole sells Cariba Red Plus credits on the voluntary carbon market for less than two US dollars each. That just about covers the project's running costs. But given the urgent need for us to take more carbon out of the atmosphere, shouldn't carbon credits be more expensive? Perhaps even so expensive that air passengers like me think twice about coming home. Sorry, Mum. I think it is important to have a global price on carbon. There have been studies done by Aita and others that suggest that if you really have global cooperation on emission reductions, you can save huge amount of money. So it would definitely be welcome to have a global scheme. But with the experience from Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement, and the recent COP in Madrid was a utter disaster, you should not wait for this. We need leadership by the private sector to drive this forward. With deforestation rampant across swathes of Southern Africa, there is huge potential for more Red Plus and other so-called nature-based solutions. But who are the real winners here? Westerners like me who get to assuage our flight shame for a fraction of the cost of our air tickets. Western companies like South Pole. Or the Zimbabweans who are actually changing their lives to protect the trees we all so badly need. I mean we measure this actually in the projects. We do surveys on the socio-economic situation and how poverty and how income locally develops. So I think the reply is fairly easy. We have this as part of our auditing process for all projects. And if we do not reduce poverty, if we don't bring social development that is positive, then we would not be certified. So it can be a win-win? It can be a win-win. And I think the certification schemes we use are measuring this and showing results. But of course we have to be selective and and where to get involved and we're not. When I set out to understand carbon credits, I did not think I'd end up on the Zambizi River with a honey cellar, or in a hospital where patients pay for treatment with cow dung. The business model is about helping people change the way they live, breaking old habits and adopting new greener ways of living. Meanwhile, all I'm doing is paying a few dollars online, and that just doesn't feel like enough.
