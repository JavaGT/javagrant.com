It's a soggy Saturday in Seoul, and I'm at the headquarters of SM Entertainment, the biggest K-pop company. It must be party time. There are dozens of young people. They're looking a little bit nervous, I have to say. Some of them look very young. They're queuing up for the weekly auditions to be the next K-pop star. Here we go. K-pop, South Korea's take on pop music, is proving to have global appeal. There's someone here who stands out because she doesn't look like she's Korean. I wonder if she speaks English. Where are you from? From Ukraine. From Ukraine? Yes. And you want to be a K-pop star? Yeah, why not? And do you live here in Korea? No, I came here for auditioning. So you came all the way from Ukraine for the audition. Yes. I'm from Russia. I went today for audition. Why do you like K-pop music? It's fun, it's positive and it's, I don't know, like very bright and colorful. K-pop isn't just inspiring wannabies from thousands of miles away, it's also selling across the globe. This is BTS, who earlier this year became the first K-pop act to top the U.S. album chart. And it doesn't stop with music. Korean TV serials, known as K-dramas, are also spreading far and wide. This tide of South Korean pop culture has become known as the Korean wave, and has already saturated much of Asia. Now it seems to be growing into a tsunami, breaking over the lucrative markets of the West. So, I want to find out what are the secret of its success. I'm standing outside a shopping mall in the middle of Seoul and there's a group of French tourists standing in front of a statue which is a pair of golden hands and they're held in the style of the dance aside from his song Gangnam style where he did this dance where he's pretending to ride a horse they're now all doing the dance in front of the statue and they've asked someone to film it for them that song Gangnam style which went viral around the world about five years ago was probably the first time a lot of people had ever heard of K-pop that's quite enough of that. For a beginner's guide to K-pop, I turn to Stacey Nam, a Korean-American who works in Seoul on international marketing and PR for the music industry. I help people abroad fall in love with K-pop artists and spend all their money um some of the bigger groups right now that are popular of course you do have bt s o you have exo xo xo is a group by this entertainment agency called s m entertainment right s m stands for su man and he was actually a singer himself before founding his own agency. A lot of the top agencies in Korea are actually the initials of the names. So YG Entertainment is the name of a person who was a singer and then founded another entertainment agency, of which Big Bang is a big group. And then Y-Y-Y-Y-Py-Y-P And then, Y-YP, which is Jinjong Park, He was another singer that founded his own group. Is it right that those three, they dominate the industry, they're the big three? So those, yeah, you could say those are the big three, but what happened recently that kind of, you know, made everyone take note was that BTS comes from this company called Big Hit which is a very small company and it's not a group that had anywhere near like the budget you know or like the ANR team or that the kind of resources you know that the big three would have but then that group is the one that made it what are these companies are they just record labels what role do they play so Korean entertainment is very very different in the one that made it. What are these companies? Are they just record labels? What role do they play? So Korean entertainment is very, very different in the fact that, like, if in America, like, let's say you take someone like Justin Bieber. Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself. He was found on YouTube, and someone recognized his talent and was like, you know what, I want to make you a star. Basically, he just goes into the studio, but he doesn't get that much training before he puts that an album. In K-pop, once you are cast by a company, they do everything. So if you need some kind of touch-ups like you want to fix your teeth, you have bad skin, you want to get plastic surgery, they'll pay for that. They'll pay for language lessons. So normally by the time they call them idols nowadays, right? The members of a boy or girl group band are called idols. They'll pay for their language education. So usually when they debut, they have someone that can speak English, someone that can speak Chinese, someone that can speak Japanese. Wow, so let's say that it's a boy band. Right. They're kind of training them for the international market. Right. So yeah, they'll get language lessons and they'll get acting lessons. They'll learn how to talk on variety shows, dance lessons. So by the time you debut, there's already been tons of money poured into making you who you are. You might have noticed Stacy talking rather casually there about plastic surgery. That's because she says it's seen here as no different to getting a new hairstyle. This group, Six Bomb, even wrote a song, Getting Pretty, about their cosmetic enhancements, with the video featuring before and after versions. Image is as important as the music, if not more so, and that means age isn't just a number. You can't be too old nowadays. How old's too old? You are probably too old. My friend. I'm past it. Maybe in your next life. If you ever desire to, because you're cute, right? So if you ever desire to be a K-pop idol in your next life, you know, come to Korea earlier. Yeah, in this life, a little bit too late, a little bit too late. Yeah, so younger, anywhere from 15 to like I would say 19, 20. They may start young, but would-be idols can be training for as long as nine years before they're finally unveiled to the public, or debut, as it's described. They're expected to work long hours, often living in accommodation provided by the company. Boyfriends and girlfriends are a big no-no. That's highly discouraged. So why is K-pop such a hit beyond South Korea? I think with K-pop it's definitely the whole package. So of course you have the music in itself which is very catchy, very bright. Although nowadays you have more genres like hip-hop and rap. But it's also like the outfits that they wear, the choreography that's really, really catchy. Usually the faces themselves or the people that are in these groups, that whole package together, I think, makes K-pop very, very unique and very, you know, very likable. K-pop is actually not Korean-style music, but it's more like breed or, you know, American pop. Kyeonghi Hanna Choi works for the Korean Foundation for International Cultural Exchange, which is funded by South Korea's Ministry of Culture, Sport and Tourism. For her, K-pop's global appeal is down to it mixing familiarity with something new. Asian people think that it's quite westernized and modernized music, but performed by Asian. Maybe the UK or US audience, they need, maybe they just want to try to some different thing. She says the success of South Korean pop culture as an export has been something organic, with the government acting merely as a facilitator. It is said that Korean Wave is just a success without design. It means nobody designed the kind of strategies, nobody has the kind of plans, but governments just tried to make market stable, so they put the kind of intellectual property or make more market-friendly policy, the kind of things. Do you as an organization try to quantify the economic benefit of the Korean wave? Yes, actually our research team. They research every year the kind of quantity and the kind of effects of the Korean wave. And this is the book of the results. So you're pointing at a very, very thick book. Yeah, it's very thick but. There's lots of tables and figures. And last year KUA brings about 18 trillion one to the Korean economy. 18 trillion one. So that's about 18 billion US dollars, about 12 billion pounds. And how does that compare to the previous year, for example? Compared to last year, it has 4% growth. Looking at this chart of growth over the past few years, it looks like there's a pretty steady growth. Yes, yes. Girls bring the Boys out I want to dance right now Make the speed of Come out It's Manas Organization closely monitors The Korean Waves Ebb and Flow So we're looking at a graph And on one axis it's This is popularity And the other It means Speed of Growth So We put Some countries Within the sector. I can see there's lots of countries in this middle section. So can you just say which those are? It's Thailand, Indonesia, China, India, UAE, Russia, Brazil, Brazil, the US, France, Australia and the UK and Turkey. So these are all in the middle sector, that means they're quite popular and growing quite fast. There are hundreds of millions of people in those countries, billions of people. There's a few countries here in this end section which means it's very popular and growing quite fast. Which are those? Malaysia and Taiwan. Whether by design or not, the success of South Korea's pop culture exports is sizable. And it's not just the content producers generating money from it. How long has this session been? I think I did about an hour and a half. You look quite tired, is it exhausting? Yes, I'm very tired. And how often do you do this kind of class? Except for the weekend, I come here every day every day. Every day? 18-year-old Kim Yersal's parents are paying 170 pounds a month for her exercise classes. The first goal is to make it to the audition, so I'm trying to lose some weight. How slim do you have to be? You already look quite slim, I have to say. At the entertainment companies, they usually tell you your weight has to be about 120 taken off from your height. So your height in centimeters minus 120 and that's how many kilograms you should weigh? Yes, that's right. So what's your height in centimeters? Kee is 1609. I'm 169, minus'm 169 minus 120. So 169 minus 120, so you need to be 49 kilograms. Yeah. How many kilograms are you now? I'm about 55 kilograms right now. Six more to go. If you're now trying to calculate whether you'd make the cut, I'll let you take a moment as D'Arsoult sheds a few more ounces. Yersal's current body mass index, the measure of obesity used by the World Health Organization, puts her at the lower end of healthy weight. Her target would take her into the underweight category. What's the dream? I want to be an idol singer. People make lots of sacrifices, even having plastic surgery. Is that something you'd think about? Because this is something I decided I want to do for my life. So if I make it to the company and the company asks me to do it, I guess I'll have to do it. That seems quite extreme to me to change your physical appearance permanently just for your job. Once you make it to the company, you have to prove your value to the company and you must sell. If you're not bringing any money in, then you're of no value to the company. And if this is what the people demand, a certain look, a certain face, then I don't think there's much you can do. It sounds like if you get a job like this, if you become an idol, that you, in a way become the property of the company that you're working for, not a person but property. Yes, I agree with you. But I did not enter this without knowing that. Very few people get into this without knowing the circumstances. So I think it's something that you must accept. Given this spirit of subservience, it's perhaps not surprising that South Korea's entertainment industry has had its fair share of abuse allegations. One star even killed herself, leaving behind a letter that claimed her agent had forced her to have sex with more than 20 VIPs. Yet such stories aren't enough to put off wannabies like Yersil, whose parents also pay up to $350 a month on Idol school. Someone like this, how often does she come here? She'll come here for a one-on-one lesson once a week, but she'll be here for her own practice almost every day, and they're preparing for their auditions, so they're not only doing vocal lessons, but they're also taking dance lessons as well. The school's director Li SoLim made her name training some of SM Entertainment's biggest stars, like Girls' Generation. We're actually one of the other students by selecting them through a lot of We're actually one of the smaller schools compared to the others that have more than 100 students because we take our students by selecting them through audition so we only take the elite and have about 70 to 80 students here How many would you say in Seoul are there? take the elite and have about 70 to 80 students here. How many would you say in Seoul are there? There are so many of them. The idol industry has been going in Korea for 20 years, and there are many schools that do similar things. And now even colleges are opening up classes that teach people to become idols, and I think this industry will keep growing. So they very genuinely let me try and join in one of the dance classes. Oh, okay, now we're kind of doing split. I mean, everyone else is. I'd barely get beyond the warm-up. Another sign I'm past it. The rest of the class move on to a complicated hip-hop routine. In the relative piece of her office, I have one more question for director Solim. Many people would see music as at its core an art form, but in this industry it seems that it's primarily a business. Is it fair to say that in K-pop it's business first? Idol music is dominant here, and we see it as a serious issue. Idle music is a planned music industry. It's a business that involves a lot of production, a lot of players. So it's inevitable that that happens. The money-making machine is very much in evidence back at SMTown, where the K-pop Hopefalls we met earlier were queuing for their auditions. On the first we've got Welcome Stage, SMTown Gift Shop, SMTown Museum, SMTown Cafe and Market, SMTown Theatre. Let's have a look inside. Well I'm in the gift shop now and it's quite overwhelming. There's pretty much everything you could want to do with a K-pop artist and more. There's clothes that they've worn, there's baseball caps, purses, there's crockery, jewellery, and over here there's a whole display of cosmetics where you can buy the face cream as used by your favourite band member with his face on the packet. As a group of school girls all wearing uniform we've just come in and one of them just ran up to a giant picture one of the, and thrown herself at the poster on the wall. They're very excited. XXO, no, BTS, you're the best. Okay. So there's a bit of rivalry between the bands. One of the girls is telling me that XO are the best and they're BTS, not so good. Exo best in them. They're actually fanning themselves with the posters. Who's in this poster? Beck-Hion. So he's from Exo? Yeah. Okay. And what's so good about him? Hey. Handsome. Good, good-old. Good night. Good singer and good boy. So that's funny. Wow, they're kind of overcome with emotion just talking about them. It's clear the fashion and beauty sectors are quick to cash in on any K-pop connection. And then there's tourism. It's not just Korean followers coming to this merchandise mecca. Where are you from? Russia. Why have you come to Seoul? Very interesting. And... K-pop. Why not? Man is very beautiful. Where are you from? Australia. What are you doing here? I really like K-pop. I like the sound and I think the stories are a lot better than sort of American pop music which I'm not really a fan of. In a lot of Western music, everyone sings about, you know, expletives and, you know, fast cars and getting drunk. Whereas here it's more, there's more a story to things, like love stories, depression, like actual things that sort of involve people, and I like that aspect of it. Like many big South Korean companies, SM Town's owner, SM Entertainment has numerous and far-reaching tentacles. One of its subsidiaries is behind the latest big TV hit, Something in the Rain. The show's producer Ma Zheng Hun shows me a clip on his office computer. There's a young man looking very forlorn, sitting in a bar, drinking on his own, and we've just cut to a young woman also looking quite sad, talking on her mobile phone outside. There's obviously some kind of romance going on here. Mom, let's just say you don't have to have a single 16-part series with episodes of 70 minutes. It's on South Korean TV on Friday and Saturday night and with its appropriately international theme music is available around the world on Netflix. Sometimes it's hard to be a woman. How long does it take you to make something like something in the rain a 16-part series? Pre-production is about six months of pre-production, three months of production, and one month of post-production, so in total 10 months. It sounds like quite a quick turnaround if you compare it to, say, a feature film, which might be 90 minutes long, and that would take a couple of years. Yes. He's nodding and smiling. It means we can check ratings from viewers online. And if they don't want a character to go away and it was scripted for that character to die, then we can change the script. That's how to get good ratings. So you actually, the fans, the viewers actually have some control over the plot. It's not all like that, but we do it with the very popular shows. Is the K-drama industry growing? It's nodding very confidently. How much? It's tripled in size since the early 2000s. How important are international sales to your business? Half of our income comes from international sales. Of that, 70% is from Asia and about 30% is from the US. Stand by your men and show the world you love him. Zhang Hun tells me he expects a bigger slice of their profit pie to be American as US production companies buy up the rights to remake successful K-dramas. He also thinks more collaborations with foreign companies are likely in the future. In the meantime, there's one crucial requirement for K-dramas to travel well. Good subtitles. Enter Vicky. Vicky is a combination of video and wiki. So combine them and get Vicky. So basically where that comes from is we are a video streaming platform, but all of our subtitles are crowdsourced, so that's where the wiki element comes in. So kind of like Wikipedia where users are creating the content or in your case they're adding to the content. Exactly, exactly. Christine Ortiz is based in Vicki's San Francisco office but has come to Seoul to meet colleagues here. They also have bases in Tokyo and Singapore. The company was bought for 130 million pounds in 2013 by Japanese e-commerce firm, Rackerton, and now has 40 million monthly active users. We're on a laptop here, and this is the homepage, vicky.com. So it's kind of sweeping along. There's different shows coming up. There's a show from Korea called Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok-Joe. This particular title is a really big hit, not only in Korea but also on our website. I've got to say I'm intrigued and the photo shows a young woman She's the weightlifting fairy. She's the weightlifting fairy. She's kind of showing off her biceps. What's a weightlifting fairy? In Korea the term fairy is often used for beautiful, feminine women. So it's kind of a contradictory having a weightlifting fairy. But essentially it's this love story between two childhood friends. One is a swimmer and the weightlifting fairy, the girl Kimbuktu. So if I, as a user, wanted to watch this show, not speaking Korean, what happens? So if you click play and your subtitle settings are set to English. Yeah. And then once the subtitles are completed by our volunteer community, they'll just auto-populate. So I noticed it said EN 100%. And how long would it take with a popular show like this from it airing and from it being 100% subtitles? The fastest we've seen a show completed or an episode completed is three to four hours. That seems pretty quick. That's a really a strong indicator of whether or not we have a hit on our hands is the subtitling speed. And let's just go back and see the number of languages. So... This show has been subtitled into 37 languages. Wow. English always gets done first. Then other languages use that as a base. This volunteer community, as Christine describes them, is of course providing Vicky with free labour, but they can earn rewards like access to the site's ad-free subscription service. Vicky has, like Netflix, started to produce its own content as well as buying from others. Drama world, in a rather meta-narrative, tells the story of an American K-drama fan who falls in to her favorite show. Taste of Love is the most popular drama on Korean television. Episode 13 comes out tonight and he still hasn't kissed his poor, spunky dishwasher turns Sochap. The storyline is a nod to the popularity of South Korean content on the site. The Korean wave has made Korean dramas really popular globally. But we've seen a really big surge in the US as well as in Latin America. I think the format of Korean dramas is very digestible. So it's 16 episodes, that's it. You only have one season. Pretty rare to have a season two. Really? Yeah. And also, the stories that they tell are very real in the sense that they're not super violent or hyper-sexualized. So I think a lot of users, especially in Latin American countries, find a lot of appeal in that. It's not like American shows where it gives nothing wrong. K-drama when a guy kisses a girl, that's it. That's true love forever. I think recently Korean dramas have found a way to showcase the best of the best of Korea, kind of selling like a lifestyle. So it's not only just the storyline, you see like the fashion, you see the beauty and you see the food, and it's all really idealistic and really attractive for a lot of people. That's part of the reason why I got into gay dramas like that. So it's quite a kind of positive, optimistic view of the world. Mm-hmm. Yeah. In its dramas and its pop music, South Korea's sparkling, synthetic, sometimes sanitized stories are an export success. A slick machine of many parts, its wheels lightly greased by government, is relentlessly pumping out content, which is then ruthlessly marketed, along with a whole lifestyle to go with it. Whether you're ready to ride the Korean wave, or it makes you want to run for the hills, it's probably heading your way. That's all from me, Simon Maven. Thanks for listening. The producer was John Murphy and the translators were Jake Kwan and Keith Park. It was mixed by Neil Churchill and edited by Penny Murphy. No producer's ears were harmed in the making of this program."}
