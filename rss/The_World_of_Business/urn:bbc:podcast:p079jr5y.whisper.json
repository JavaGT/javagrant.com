This podcast is supported by advertising outside the UK. Welcome to the World of Business podcast. I'm Caroline Bailey. And in this download edition of In Business on Radio 4, we're talking about a material that's everywhere in raw materials, in packaging, and most worryingly in our oceans. It's plastic. I'm asking how companies, large and small, are responding to the public backlash against plastic. Below us, we've got a box full of disembodied arms, which have got a blue sleeve on them. This is quite bizarre, I have to say. Yes, I know. They're tiny, and they're shooting off the end of a conveyor belt in a highly automated factory, where robots beep as they glide effortlessly up and down the gangways. And the end product is slightly alarming. It'll look a lot better when the arm is attached to a body. Yes. As well as arms, this Danish company, known by children and adults all over the world, makes heads and bodies and millions of bright colourful bricks every hour. But this corner of the factory is different. This machine here is making little white pieces that look like spider webs, but there's something very important about how they're made. So these elements are made from our sustainable plastic. This is the plastic material that's a plant-based from sugarcains that we have started using. So this is quite remarkable. You might have guessed by now. I'm in a toy factory where they're making tiny pieces for one of the most recognisable brands in the world, Lego. Lego is using plant-based plastic in a few of its pieces such as trees, bushes and these spider webs. Like other companies, large and small, it simply can't ignore the change in the public attitude towards plastic. We'll come back to Lego in its tiny hometown of Billund and Denmark later in the program. But first, how and when did this current backlash against plastic really take off? When we look back at 2015, 2016, and even 2017, there was very, very, very little conversation in the media or social media about plastic pollution. In fact, we compared it to climate change and we compared it to air pollution and it was basically flatlined. There was no conversation about it. This is June Ives, executive director of a campaigning organisation called Lonely Whale, based in the US. Their focus is on getting the public and businesses to stop using single-use plastic. They've run campaigns such as strawless in Seattle, where in one month, September 2017, 2.3 million plastic straws were permanently removed from outlets, and a citywide ban on single-use plastic straws was announced. And then, with the broadcast of one TV program, June Ives says the issue really took off. Sir David Attenborough and the BBC Ocean film and the conversation that ensued was probably one of the most influential pieces from a policy change standpoint. It was late 2017 when the broadcaster, Sir David Attenborough, highlighted the damage plastic in the ocean is doing to wildlife on his BBC series Blue Planet 2. Almost everyone I spoke to for this program talked about the Blue Planet Effect, being a trigger for public outrage across the world. Meanwhile, Lonely Whale was trying to make the movement against plastic straws go global. Their slogan, Stop Sucking. It was incredibly successful. It went into more than 40 countries and was natively localized in 25 languages in just three months. And I've got to be honest, like it really shocked us that our campaign went into Poland. Really shocked us. Our campaign went into Egypt. Our campaign went everywhere. Suddenly, after years of trying to get through to the public, campaigns against plastic were now getting the sort of traction they could barely have dreamt of in the past. The tide was finally turning against plastic were now getting the sort of traction they could barely have dreamt of in the past. The tide was finally turning against plastic. Governments and institutions were declaring war on single-use plastic and were even proposing bans. And any company that used plastic simply had to listen to the public who were now acutely aware of the damage it was doing and wanted real change. For the business world, this was potentially catastrophic for some, but a golden opportunity for others, as the backlash against plastic highlighted glaring gaps in the market, just waiting to be filled. Well, here we are at Istrid Munnach, half an hour's train journey from Cardiff, and we're waiting for the people from Trans-ZEN packaging, who are about to come and pick us up and take us to their shiny new factory where they're making paper straws. Oh, that looks like them. Hello! I'm Caroline. Hello. Entrepreneurs Lorenzo Angelucci and Mark Varney whisk us off to their new company down the road. Lorenzo founded TransZEN packaging in South Wales 18 months ago after a long career in a multinational packaging firm. Mark, a former colleague, was his first employee and he came on board as sales and marketing director. The idea was to offer environmentally friendly packaging. The original plan was to make paper cartons. But then came Blue Planet 2 and a wave of campaigns against plastic. One particular viral video was, in business terms, a bit of a light bulb moment for Lorenzo. When I saw the poor turtle with a plastic straw in the nostril bleeding, when I saw that, I realised that that was the end of the plastic straw and, as a consummate, plastic. This was a huge opportunity for his start-up. If it was all over for plastic straws, what about paper ones? And when it came to selling the idea, after 20 years in the business, he was able to go straight to the top. First customer I went is McDonald's. I know them very well from my past relationship with them. And I went to meet Paul Pomeroy, the CEO. And I offered him to produce paper straws in the UK, and he was very happy to have a product that he thought was very relevant. What brought about this sudden change? You've talked to me a lot about the environmental credentials of your startup, but what brought about this? Because you've all been in the packaging industry for several years, decades even. So the market has really changed in the last year. So if you were to propose environmental friendly packaging solution to companies before, the main barrier was price for a company to switch from plastic to paper. It would have cost lots of money. Number two is also the fact that, you know, there is an inertia coming from the general public? So is the general public really so keen to use a paper straw compared to the plastic straw? They're more soggy. They perform not as good as plastic straws. So what really change is that the general public perception has changed. Well, let's go and see the factory. I'd like to actually learn how these straws are made. Fantastic. Let's go and have a look round. Okay, so the paper straw manufacturing process first starts off with what we class as a mother reel. And this is a huge roll of paper. It weighs approximately two tons. We have to slit this down into size. So then we put the colour on it. So we've got everything from black barber stripe, green, red, blue. The three layers of straw get pulled in together and it just wraps it around this mandrel size. Now you know it reminds me of a spinning wheel almost. It's not too dissimilar. This bit here actually cuts it to the length that you want it. And then here we've got the straws coming off down a chute and being collected at the bottom. That's right. On average, each machine will make 140 straws per minute. So every day, this line should be able to make at least 4.5 million straws per day. Can you just tell me your name? Ms. Joanne. How long have you worked here? Roughly five months. What were you doing before? I used to work in a sewing factory. And we got made redundant. The factory closed, so about ten of us come here. Are you getting busier all the time? More busier every day, yeah. They want more and more. Transcend packaging is growing rapidly. They only moved into their factory building last summer with ten employees. Now there are 80, and they expect that number to rise to between 150 and 200 by the end of the year. They can't keep up with the demand. And as their customers in the catering world adapt to the new public mood, Lorenzo Angeloucci says priorities are changing. Some of them were caught unprepared. And obviously, when you are caught unprepared, you start panicking. And so all of a sudden the cost is no more the main problem. Is who's going to supply? Isn't this just a middle point moving from single-use plastic to paper? Isn't the end point people not using paper straws? So the paper straw or the straw in general is one of the you know simple and most used tool. It's nice to seep and it is an habit that we want, we have and want to keep. Do we want to keep it though? I mean public opinion has changed so quickly just in a matter of months, hasn't it, again, single-use plastic? Surely you could see the next wave coming and everything you're doing here could disappear. Potentially, I hope not, because I have just invested lots of machinery to do that here in Europe. The real alternative to packaging is your hands. So you will definitely need packaging. And our new generation, I have two young daughters, so I know them very well, unfortunately. They want everything fast and now. So they live on the present, not so much the future. And so if they want to grab a cup of coffee or a sandwich on the go they just want it but at the same time they are very very conscientious more than probably our generation on environment okay lovely so would you like some paper instead or it's okay? Perfect. Bananas can come out? Yes, definitely. They really don't need a plastic bag. Customers at this supermarket in Cornwall are tearing off the plastic packaging from their shopping. It's not just single-use plastic items such as straws and cups which are ubiquitous. When it comes to wrapping the goods we buy, the public's eyes have been open to the fact that plastic is everywhere. I think the trouble starts with the actual packaging companies. We never used to have this sort of stuff and we don't need it now. Far from it. I'm Sarah and I'm a volunteer for plastic free pensance. Today we're at the supermarket just doing a mass unwrap, so helping consumers get rid of unnecessary plastic packaging. And I think as soon as you start looking, people really become aware of just how much there is. Okay, so we've got a huge... Consumer action like this is obviously designed to make the retailers stop and think about their plastic packaging. That's also the job of Helen Bird at the Environmental Charity Rapp, where they've been working on tackling plastic waste for years. She says the Blue Planet Effect and the surge in public awareness has made it easier to engage big companies. Something that Rapp was working on previously, but was very much galvanised action as a result of this backlash, was the launch of something called the UK Plastics Pact. And what that's about really is about big businesses coming together, united behind some really ambitious targets to look at how can we eliminate unnecessary problematic, pointless plastic, how can we make all plastic packaging designs to be recyclable, reusable or compostable, how can we effectively recycle more of that material? And critically, how can we also help drive the market for recycled material through targets of stimulating recycled content back into packaging? And when we initially set up the UK Plastics Pact, to be honest, we weren't quite prepared for the response that we got from business, which was absolutely remarkable. So many of them are now signed up and want to get behind those targets and deliver that by 2025. How much bigger was it than you expected then? I think it was probably about double the amount of number of businesses that have come forward to be part of that initiative. Are there any businesses that you're aware of who are seriously concerned about the plastics backlash? I mean are they really, really worried, not about the environment, but about the fact that it's going to impact on their business? Well, I think that if they're not worried, then they certainly should be. But I think it really does present them with an opportunity for change. But there's a problem. One reason plastic is so popular with food retailers is that it keeps produce fresh and on our shelves for longer. And that in itself is good for the environment. Plastic does have a really vital role to play in making sure that we don't increase food waste. And actually in carbon terms, the impact of food waste is around 10 times greater than that of the packaging. So actually we can't take our eye off the ball in terms of food waste. It's a real dilemma for the supermarkets as they respond in different ways to cause for less plastic. One has pledged to get rid of all plastic packaging in its own brand lines by 2023, but it's proving challenging. Do you know I think about a casserole? Would you want to put that in a casserole? I think so, yes. I've come to a branch of the UK frozen food supermarket chain, Iceland, to meet managing director Richard Walker. He claims that they're leading the march against plastic packaging. But from where I'm standing here with fresh fruit and veg on one side and frozen ready meals on the other, I can still see an awful lot of plastic and it does look as if there's some way to go. Indeed, yeah. I mean, it's a wall of plastic. It's frustrating and I wish we could move quicker. I think the reaction we're getting from a lot of people is, well, why can't you just do it right now? But it's complex. We're dealing with hundreds of different suppliers, and often it's about the on-cost to them, allowing them to transition over, change their supply lines, and of course, trialling materials, because plastic is so ubiquitous for a reason. It's because it's fantastic. It preserves the product. It obviously prolongs shelf life, and that's why it's pretty much bagged, wrapped, coated, everything. Iceland produces 100 million black plastic ready meal trays every year. That's over 1,000 tonnes of plastic. Richard Walker shows me what they're trying to do about it. Okay, so we're at one of the frozen food counters. So actually this is a great example because it shows the transition we've got pretty much the same products. Some of them are in the black plastic trays. Some are in this board tray here. It's made from Finnish pine. I've actually been to the forest where it comes from because I think you know the integrity of the supply chains that we're replacing plastic with is so important because we need to make sure we're not just replacing one problem with another. You'll see on this, this shows the scale of some of the challenge that we face because it still has a plastic film covering the top. And like this is normal plastic? This is normal plastic. Are you doing it because you believe it's the right thing to do, or are you doing it for business reasons? If I were doing it for business reasons, I'd be a pretty dumb businessman because it's the right thing to do or are you doing it for business reasons? If I were doing it for business reasons I'd be a pretty dumb businessman because it's not directly driven sales and it has added a lot of cost into the business and you know it will eventually add millions. We're a private company so we can think long term and therefore we can make long-term decisions that you that may cost us money in the short term. But I genuinely think it's the right thing to do. I think we have a responsibility to do it and it should hopefully in the long term make good business sense as well. But will customers end up paying more? No, we can't pass a penny on to our customers. It would be commercial suicide in a market as competitive as UK retail. Richard Walker says Iceland is trying all kinds of alternatives to their traditional plastic packaging. But this is a process of trial and error with some surprising results. Things like our red cartons, we've moved them out of plastic and we put them into pulp packaging, which didn't cost as much and sales have gone up because the product looks more premium. But we learn as we do all of this. You know, our luxury chilled steaks, we took them out of plastic and we put them into a paperboard tray and stock loss went up, people stealing the product. And we couldn't work out why. And after observing that for a couple of weeks, we worked out that shoplifters were bending it and sticking it down the trousers and walking out which obviously you can't do with the rigid plastic so we're learning a lot sometimes it's good sometimes it's about removing costs not necessarily increasing cost and sometimes it just doesn't work Iceland has introduced reverse vending machines into some of its stores customers bring back their empty plastic bottles and can get money off vouchers in return. But Richard Walker says to have any real impact on plastic pollution, far more radical action is necessary. Recycling is part of the solution, but we are never going to recycle our way out of the plastic epidemic. And I'm worried, quite frankly, that customers are being greenwashed into thinking, if they recycle, that'll stop the scourge of plastic. It won't. My big worry with big plastic is they're closing ranks around plastic. They're talking about recycle content. They're talking about increased rates of recyclability. And that's all great. But all that will lead to is more plastic being produced. What we need to do first and foremost is reduce the production of plastic, and that's why we've taken our rather dramatic stance to get out of plastic, because unless we start consuming less plastic, we're never going to solve this problem. When we teach sustainability to our students, we teach them that there's a hierarchy of the things that you should address and those are the ours. Dr. Rhoda Trimingham is Head of Sustainable Design at Loughborough University. So the first is always refuse. The second is reduce, so we need to reduce the amount of materials or resources that we're going to use in order to provide a consumer with the product, then we need to reuse, and then at the end of that, it's recycle. So actually, recycle is the last thing we need to think about. It's the reduce and reuse that comes first. But when an issue like the backlash against plastic takes off at such speed, Dr. Rhoda Trimingham says businesses don't always think things through. What I'm worried about is that moving away from plastics in certain areas may not be the right choice at the moment because the alternatives may have what we call unintended consequences. So we may be able to say that we've reduced plastic by 25% within a company by 2025. But by doing that, we may have increased greenhouse gas emissions within that company. So I think we need to be really careful about the changes we're making and making sure that they're positive across all impacts that will affect us. Do you think that plastic has a future or has it become too toxic? I actually hope it has a future. There's an awful lot of research going on at the moment to ensure that plastic becomes a cyclical material so that it can be reused over and over again. But I really hope that we do get more tough on the big producers about only producing what we really need and reducing the amount of plastic tat that you see around everywhere. One of the alternatives to traditional plastic is bioplastic or biopolymers made from plants rather than oil. They're marketed as a more environmental, often biodegradable option, but in reality it's not that straightforward or easily understood by consumers. They're made of various things, mostly cornstarch or cellulose, which is sort of paper-based product, and they degrade, but they degrade under certain conditions. So they need to be in a hot mass of compost, basically, with the right mix. So if you're putting these products in your garden garden or if they make their way to the sea, they're not going to degrade. That's because they need to be sent to an industrial incinerator or composter along with food waste. A biodegradable piece of plastic is no benefit to the environment if it simply ends up in landfill with ordinary rubbish. I'm seeing a lot of coffee shops moving to coffee cups made from biopolymers, and that's not the right choice, because if you think you're going to walk out of a coffee shop into a town centre or into a park or take it to your place of work, very often they don't have those waste facilities for you to then send that cup in the right direction. Now you have to try and build a fish. And don't feel the pressure because everything you build will become a fish. Oh I see. I mean I'm being told that I really ought to try and be a little bit more creative and not be quite so intense about this whole process. A nice colours have got a sort of pale green, orange and red. You know, I think it looks a little bit more like a cross-channel ferry than a fish. But now I'm going to put my fish on here. Which one is the front of your fish? That's the front. Yes, of course. Sorry. Of course. Sorry. We're back in Billand, home of the Lego group on a tour of Lego House, the company's showcase activity centre. It dominates the tiny town square and you could be forgiven for thinking it was a modern opera house until you spot a pile of giant Lego bricks in the forecourt. Everything inside, from the 15-meter-high tree of creativity, to the rather uncomfortable chair I'm sitting on, is made of Lego. Sitting on an equally uncomfortable Lego chair opposite me is Tim Brooks, the company's vice president for environmental responsibility. We heard at the beginning of the program that Lego is making some of its pieces out of plant-based plastic. So its original source is sugar cane and a company that works with us takes the sugar cane and converts that into a material called ethanol and then that ethanol is then processed into ethylene and polyethylene from there on. So it's identical to fossil-based plastic. It's just the source is from a natural material from a plant and not from oil, from crude oil. Can you just show me what they look like? Open a box here. Let me just get them out of a bag. And we've got some little green trees. There's some trees and some bushes, whoops, and some leaves. The finished bioplastic Lego piece is the same as a traditionally made one. It feels the same, it's hard, and there's no question of it dissolving into mush. So we're in about 80 different shapes, so this bush is one shape, this tree is another, so about 80 in total, and we're growing that year on year. We're trying to make Lego bricks with zero damage to the planet. So by 2030 we say we want all of our bricks to be made from sustainable materials. That's our goal. That's our big challenge. Isn't the problem with the bioplastic that you're using at the moment for some of your Lego elements that it isn't easily biodegradable? I mean the problem is what do you do with plastic at the end of its life? So we don't want Lego bricks to necessarily be biodegradable. We want them to last a long time. That's the whole point around the fact that it can be clicked together with any brick made since 1958. You know, I have my Lego bricks from the early 80s, and I just gave them to my son the other day. And some of those bricks were my dads actually he had some of the original very first Lego bricks and so that sort of story of passing down from from one generation to the other is something that that's what we should be focusing on in terms of materials. We're sitting on plastic Lego chairs we're in a palace of plastic Lego bricks we're in the Lego house it's very impressive but it's all plastic. I mean, how do you justify that? How do you justify a business that is so based on plastic in today's world? Why I would justify it is because you can take each one of those bricks apart and you can make a different carpet or a different chair or a rocket or a spaceship. But essentially it's just for fun. I mean, you are a toy company. Can you really justify generating all these plastic products? If they are reusable and durable and long lasting and at the end of their life they can be recycled, absolutely we can justify it because at the end of the day kids need to play, they need to learn, they need to learn through play and that will turn them into the society we want in the future. But Lego will always be plastic. Lego will pretty much, probably, maybe always be plastic, but it will be plastic from a variety of sources. Plastic is a great material, but it just needs to be treated with more respect. And that is the challenge for businesses. As we've heard, some companies are responding by reducing their use of plastic and by looking for alternatives. But at the moment this is all voluntary, and they do have their reputations to protect in the face of public opinion, which is now acutely attuned to the damage inflicted by plastic waste. But June Ives of US Campaign Group Lonely Whale says customers and companies can take this to the next level. Individuals influence corporations, corporations and influence policymakers. And it's really a policy that helps to change the course of our future. And when governments from across the European Union to India and the UK turn pledges into legal bans on single-use plastics, then no one in the corporate world will be allowed to ignore the backlash against plastic.
