Now, northern Uganda is a very green place. Much of the land is undeveloped. But over the last couple of years, hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing South Sudan's bitter civil war have been put into giant settlements dotted across the region. They're clearing the land to make homes for themselves, and they get food rations from the UN. But a lack of international help means those food rations have been cut in the last year, and many refugees say that the monthly ration doesn't actually last a month. They grow some vegetables, but they also need to find other ways to survive, to get a better diet, frankly, to get anything. I'm John Murphy, and visiting refugee settlements like in VEPI, my colleague Ruth Alexander and I wondered how these refugees, who have so little to start with, actually make a living. We came across a number of small markets that have sprung up. What better way to find out than to talk to those who have set up small businesses. Here are their stories. And there's a woman here preparing somebody's hair, pulling it tight and then twisting it, it looks like, into tresses, little mini tresses. So this is a hairdresser, sort of makeshift hairdressers at the edges of the market. This is northern Uganda and Invepi refugee settlement, now home to around 125,000 South Sudanese who fled civil war back home. Uganda has taken in over a million refugees from South Sudan, the world's newest country. Some of them have brought their skills with them and have set up businesses. Gosh, what's happening to this lady's hair? We planted this one yesterday, she has not finished, huh? It was late. That's why she has come. These are hair extensions. Yeah, those are hair extensions. Those are like those ones. Oh yeah? Yeah. Blossom dreadlocks, you're showing me. I have to admit I'm not a great expert in hair care, nor dreadlocks for that matter. But Panina from Yeh in South Sudan is polite enough to forgive me my ignorance. I'm just looking. More extensions, yeah? being put in place. Panina opened her hairdressers here in Invepi three months ago. Her clients are both refugees and locals, like Juliet. Where you from? I'm from Arrua. Arrua. So you're Ugandan? Yes, I'm here. Arrua is the largest town around here,'re Ugandan? Yes, I'm a pure Ugandan. Arrua is the largest town around here, about an hour and a half away along muddy roads, at least in the rainy season. This is Juliet's third visit to Penina's Salon, which is in fact a shack covered in white plastic sheeting. And all around there are other shacks with other small enterprises. So for in businessbusiness, we wanted to know just how do you set up a business in a refugee settlement? But first, let's get back to Juliet and that hair. Well, now that sound you hear quite often around here is the grinding mill, and there's one that started up nearby, so there's quite a lot of noise. Just tell me what you've had done to your hair describe it to me my hair they first plate it free hand then after that they start weaving on weaving yes putting these weaved extensions on yeah and you've gone for a red look as well yeah it's red are you trying to make a statement why have you chosen this to make it look nice nice for me I just want to be short I don't want this crazy crazy hairs it looks a little bit crazy to me short but crazy at least sort and crazy but I don't like that one which goes up to here they don't like the shoulder length stuff. Yeah. You want the short hair. Yeah. So you have these curly bits of her hair, twisty bits of hair sticking up with red sticking out and it looks very fetching. Yes, it looks very good. Thank you. Can I just ask how much is a hair do like this? This one is 35,000. Yes. Which is 35,000. Yes. Which is almost $10. But this is three visits to get your hair sorted. Yes. Because it's a complicated business getting all these things. Yeah, so it's so complicated. Imagine how difficult it is to set up any business under these circumstances, in a refugee settlement, which not long before was wild bushland, and which the refugees had to clear themselves first. All this when you fled from war, leaving most of your possessions behind. The refugees do get some help from aid agencies, food, plastic sheeting, cooking utensils, health checks. The relief effort is funded mainly by foreign governments and the European Union. The British government's aid budget for the whole of Uganda is Â£72 million. But even with the help, refugees need to do a lot for themselves. It's clear Penina is a woman of strong character and energy. I was not going to live because I love my country and I love my home. But the worst thing is when I saw a woman being killed and a child, how I as a woman continue to stay in South Sudan if such things are happening like women are killed and children. That's why I've started this to help me at least supporting my children because I have my children how many children did you say you have I have four children four children and your husband where is he my husband is in South Sudan stayed in South Sudan why did he stay yeah when I was coming he said he was not coming. We were communicating, but I came with the children. He refused to come, but now it has taken me since I started operating this saloon. Three months, I'm not communicating with him. His phone number is not going, and I don't know what's happening. According to the United Nations Refugee Agency, the UNHCR, 86% of the South Sudanese refugees are women and children. Many of the people we spoke to had similar stories. Their husbands stayed behind, to look after the family home or business or their cattle. Or they joined the fighting forces, some willingly, some not. Many were killed. So in refugee settlements like in VEPI, the owners is chiefly on women to provide for their families, to be entrepreneurs. Starting any business is not easy because it's difficult to get money at the beginning, at least to design the business so that people come. And always it's not easy before you start gaining small, small back. A refugee come like this is not easy for the refugees to get even money. You see, they sell their own things like the beans. They measure for you, the oily, you see? So they're paying with beans and oil instead? Yeah, because there's nothing, there's no money. So where do you get the cash to buy all this material to get your business going? Those who come with little cars we can play and those ones who has nothing, if they come with the beans, we take, they come with oil we take, we sell these things. After selling, we are able to passage this. Do my friend who is the Uganda supported me with the little money at the beginning. And where does all this stuff come from? Where do you this from i buy these things from koppoko from the town which is both towns which are about maybe an hour and a half away by car from here you seem to be somebody with a lot of energy where does that come from that's god You're looking up in the sky. It's God. Is it? It's you too. Yeah. You have to use your brain. You see, if you're a human being, you're supposed to use what God wanted you to do. So God has given me all this, I have to use also my brain to do something. Then staying idle. Amid the hair extensions and posters of the hair extensions and posters of the body, I'm not use also my brain to do something. Then staying idle. Amid the hair extensions and posters of hairstyles, which hang from the wooden poles of her makeshift salon, there are various creams, anointments, hair food, avocado oil, as well as combs, scissors, and a large hair dryer. All of them have to be bought from the local towns. Profit margins are not big for most in this market. Hello. Here's a woman with a headscarf on her head and in a traditional African dress, blue, yellow and cream color. And I can see that you're selling some onions, some bigger onions, some smaller onions, and some tiny little chilies, which I imagine are quite hot. What is your name? My name is Lana Awate. She's called Lorna Awate. And where are you from? From here, Southern Sudan. Lorna sits still on the ground, on her plastic sheet, her few vegetables in front of her. With the help of my South Sudanese translator Paul Knight, she explains how she and her children arrived with just a few belongings in April. Her husband, a soldier with government forces, stayed behind. Life is hard here in Invepi, she says. She and her children are often sick. She had little choice but to start this small business, at least to try to vary the diet of beans and flour given by the UN. She said she started her business by selling few of the oil, the ratio that is given to them by the UN agencies. The oil ration that she was given, yes. And the cooking flour also. So she sells part of them. Then that's where she raised some small money to start this onion business and this whole tiny chili. And how is business actually going? She's saying the market is slow and sometimes in the whole day she can only raise 1,500 shillings. Which is less than 50 cents. And that's what she gets every day. Do you expect to make your life now here in Uganda or do you expect to go back to South Sudan? She's saying they want to go back. When there's peace? Whether there's peace or there's no peace, she wants to go back. She said it very quietly. She's, oh, she's crying. She's saying she has just talked. She doesn't want to talk about it. Okay. As I step away, Paul talks to Lorna before catching up with me. These are some of the refugees who have seen some horrible situations back home. It's a bit trauma about the situation and the loss of some of their family members. I think she has lost a lot and she feels being here is no different than being back home in South Sudan. So doing business in these circumstances, one, it's maybe a desperate move, but it's also incredibly difficult. Yeah, it's difficult. If you look around the market, you will see most of the businesses they have here. It's less than one dollar. They make only a dollar a day. They make less than a dollar a day. And if you can see, even, you don't have a lot of stuff to sell. No, not much produce, just a few onions and a few chilies. So you find someone sitting the whole day for eight hours on their hot sun and getting something less than. Not a great business climate for them or living climate. Yeah. And that can be true for local Ugandans too. This is a poor region in a poor country. The people around here are mainly farmers living a largely subsistence existence. But the arrival of so many South Sudanese, in a previously undeveloped part of the country, has provided some local Ugandans with opportunities, like when it comes to cooking fuel. Here you can hear this crunch. Yeah, this charcoal, yeah. Yeah, this charcoal. Which is essential here, yeah? It's very essential, yeah. And what's your name? My name's Abdul Karim Ali. Actually, I'm based in Arua. Are you Ugandan or are you South Sudanese? Well, I'm Ugandan. I'm Ugandan and I live in town. Major, I normally come here to purchase this charcoal from refugee. Okay. So the refugees are preparing this charcoal and you're coming to this settlement to buy it? Yes. Major, right now there's business booming here in the refugee camp, whereby they cure this one, and then we come and buy from them, and then we go and sell it in town center in urban areas. It's actually very expensive in town there. That's why you come all the way to this settlement, refugee settlement. Yeah, yeah. To get a better deal with them. You know, due to condition, they sell cheaply. Some even sell their own stuff. They sell items which the United Nations normally donate for them. And then you can sell them on at a profit? Yeah, we get profit, of course. Without profit, we cannot deal in such business. We get a lot of profit from them. But the problem, again, on the way sometimes government normally re-arrest, you know. Well, the government doesn't like you to make money off the refugees? Yeah, out of refugee items, especially refugee items. Like their food, oil, other items. So doing business with charcoal is okay, but doing business with the items that they're given by the UNHCR is not okay. It's a dangerous business. But we still insist. You know, in a business, sometimes you get, sometimes you lose. So we cannot stop because government, you know, arrest, no, no, no. We buy. We buy. One thing about all these camps is they're quite noisy. You probably can hear a generator that's just got going. So we'll try and plug on through that. Give me an indication of the price difference. For example, you're buying it here and then you sell it in Arruua in the main town. What's your profit? Well, I normally buy here like at 15,000. 15,000 is like Ugandan shillings. Ugandan shillings. I get as much as double. So 15,000 is about, let me just do a quick calculation. I think it's about four dollars. Close there. Yeah, like four dollars. Yeah. But you can sell it's about $4. Close there. Yeah, like $4.4, yeah. But you can sell it for maybe $8. Yes. So 25-year-old Abdul Karim can make a tidy profit from the refugees as they clear land and chop down trees to make the charcoal. It is controversial. There have been some clashes with local Ugandans worried that too many trees are being removed, though everyone around here, refugee and Ugandan alike, is trying to make a living. I have other job, but right now I lost my job. In Uganda life is not easy. You have to gamble here and there. Things are tough in Uganda, I tell you. There's no unemployment. Yeah, I'm a graduate, but there's nothing that I can do. You have to do petty, petty work for survival. Otherwise, you and your family, you have nowhere to go. Overall, your view of these refugees who've come here and who are now providing you with charcoal, it's a good thing? It's actually a very good thing. I'm so grateful for government, for the United Nations, all the companies who come to support you refugee in Uganda I'm actually so grateful for them you know I don't know what's wrong with other countries they don't want to welcome they don't give hospitality to refugees they come with a lot of ideas you get a lot of techniques from them now like us most of us don't know how to cure this fuel this this this charcoal but since they came in our country in good number now they have brought us a lot of skills you know right now I even know how to ban this charcoal. But since they came in our country in good number now they have brought us a lot of skills, you know. Right now I even know how to burn this charcoal myself. Okay, so you've learned how to cure as you say charcoal from from the refugees. Yeah. There's business booming in a camp. As you can see, we are mixed up. They are Sudanese and Ugandans. They all mixed up. They are coming together to do business in order for better survival. And what about anything negative? Is there anything negative about it? Well, yeah. You know, those refugees, since they came many, they didn't screen them very well. Some are sick. Some of them normally bring us contact disease, you know? Things like cholera. You know, the toilet here is not so sufficient. You understand? Okay. Not enough lose. There is no enough loose. You understand? Okay, not enough lose. There's no enough loose. People drop everywhere, you understand? People pee everywhere, which brings a lot of, you know, difficulties and sickness to our people. But for you, as a small-scale business man, the balance is a good balance. Yeah, it's a good balance. At the end of the day, I have a reason to smile. And you are smiling. Yeah, I'm a reason to smile. And you're all smiling. Yeah, I'm smiling. As some South Sudanese women load up large sacks of charcoal, 15 in total, sealing the tops with leaves, Abdul Karim has arranged for transportation back to town. But a word of warning, trading in charcoal like this is not strictly legitimate. Let me put it this way. It's like a black market. The government doesn't actually accept trading charcoal because of the side effect. You understand? Because of the environmental impact. The environmental impacts. You understand. So they expect you to cut lances. They expect you to have a license to do this? Yes, please. Okay. And you have to pay for license to do this? Yes, please. Okay, and you have to pay for the license? You pay for the license. I used to pay those days, but nowadays I have now realized there, you know. I cannot tell you the secret, but, I can't tell you. As you say, this is a black market? Yes, please. It's a black market. In black product? In a black product. With a black African boy. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. product. In a black product, with a black African boy. The thing to remember about these refugee camps is that they aren't camps, their settlements. The refugees are given plots of land, basically African bush, to clear and build shelters on and to cultivate. They have the right to work and freedom of movement. And local Ugandans too are free to come and go here, for example to use the medical center and to set up shop. Just a few steps away from Abdul Karim, I meet another trader. Hello, hello. So I've just come across a young lady here who's eating avocado. What have you mixed it with? Yeah, I'm now mixed it with sugar. With sugar. Yeah. Avocado and sugar. But she's got nice teeth at the moment. Don't eat too much sugar. Tell me, what is your name? My name is Aida. Aida. Yeah. And you're Ugandan. I'm in Uganda. You've got a stall of what is it, avocados? Onions and this seed, bananas. You're doing a sale. I shouldn't get in a way. Is she asking you the price? The price, yeah. I told her it's 500 only, Ugandan ceilings. 500 shillings for a bunch of onions. And how long have you been doing this stall here? It's three month. Where'd you come from normally? Where do you live? I come from Arua. So why did you come from a rural? And how long have you been doing this stall here? It's three months. Where'd you come from normally? Where'd you live? I come from Arua. So why did you come and do business here? No, I'm looking for school fees. Oh, you're looking for school fees. Yeah, I wanted to go for further studies, so that's how I can get the fees. But you've come here in VEPI to the refugee settlement especially. You think it's going to be better business here than in Arrua? Okay, in Arrua there there's also challenging paying rents so I can't afford whereby I have a small capital. So here it's cheaper to do the business? Yeah it is here because only here you're paying fee, market fee only. A market fee. And how much is a market fee? 500 only. 500 Ugandan shillings. And there are about 3,500 Ugandan shillings to the dollar, yes. So you can make good profit here. But now these days, the business is challenging. Sometimes you can spend the whole day with mine us buying. Okay. So you have competition. Look, there are some more avocados over therece buying. Okay. Well, you have competition. Look, there are some more avocados over there. Yeah. And there, actually, all around us, fruit and veg. Yeah, this is the challenge. You photo, you give 1,000. I don't have a photo. You photo is there. You give 1,000. I haven't got a photo. We're interrupted by a woman demanding money from me for taking photographs. She isn't easy to shake off. And nor does she buy any of 22-year-old Ida's avocados or onions. You cannot get a customer to buy. You can spend the day here getting 1,000 per day. So this is a bit challenge. Have you done any kind of business before? No. I was calling, actually, the person who was paying me had got an accident. He was a soldier. He was my uncle. I was actually an orphan. That's why he decided to pay him. I lost him. So after winning, he passed away. Have no one to take care of. That's why I decided to do this. So you have to make money yourself now? Yeah, that's why. I look for money to eat, to survival. That's for education. So this is how I start. The sun's absolutely beating down. It's really quite hot. And you can possibly hear some blaring music just about in the background. The volume turned up just that little bit too high, so it's distorted. But we've stepped away a bit, come to the edges of the market, and yet you can see that just down this dusty road there are all sorts of stalls, new stalls, that have opened up recently, people selling small knick-knacks, flip-flops, some eggs, maybe some vegetables, mobile phone cards, very important. And as we walk away from the market, there are newer tents going up. So this market is growing, it's spreading down the road, servicing the needs of not only the South Sudanese refugee population, but also the local Ugandan population. Just a bit along, we come across a man digging with a hoe at the base of a tree. Yeah, my name's Zam Duku Luka-Jun from South Sudan, particularly from Yei. From Yei? Yes. I came here in February and well I found somehow life better here because I don't listen to guns, I don't hear somebody being killed, I don't look at miserable things, probably someone slaughtered, someone, you know, being chopped. So now that I can sleep, even if the door is not okay, you can sleep, there's no problem. And what are you doing here? Why are you digging the earth? Well, I'm trying to pick this so that I take to that small house, you see there? Small house is actually a wooden frame with this UNHCR plastic sheet in here. So inside there are full of stones as you can see. Okay, so you're taking the soil inside. To make a better flooring. And what do you hope to do with this hut in the end? Oh well I want to turn it into a business kind of place. We started with some small printing. We make a bit of photocopying, probably charging. While charging, they put at 500, but we have reduced ours to 200 ceilings. So you're undercutting the competition. The competition so that I'll get something small for myself, probably my family. And do you get an impression that with these businesses setting up, is life getting better here? Well, in terms of town life, it's somehow getting better. But in other words, it's giving a big harm to our young children, especially young girls. It's harming the young... It's harming the young girls because, you know, they are vulnerable, they don't have their money, they don't have anything. Now at the end of the day, they exchange sex for money, and then the young boys end up, you know, spending their time over here in these disco places, so they forget real about their education and all this kind of thing. And what did you do when you were back in South Sudan? What was your life about? In South Sudan, I was running a business. At the same time, I was a lecturer at one of the institutions. Lecturing in what? In business management. Okay. Yeah. So he ought to know a thing or two about setting up a business. But he complains that the best local jobs are reserved for Ugandans, while refugees like him scrape by setting up these small, barely profitable enterprises. I also learned that his wife and two children who escape from South Sudan ahead of him are currently based in a different refugee settlement. But thank God I'm still alive. The only worry here is that I've not set a very good foundation for my children. So there's no way out. But do you feel that your business knowledge that you gained, is that going to help you here? No, there's no option. I just have to go like that because that's life. I cannot reverse me and try to, you know, go back, you know. Let's have a quick look at you all. Yeah, please. As we get a mini tour of his shack, you can hear the stony ground he's trying to smooth out with the soil. The rough soil we need to get those. So this is the house I'm trying to prepare. Oh it's dark, clothes hanging up. Yeah. And then this is where I sleep. This is my bed. It's not very big, is it? Yeah, it's not very big. It's just very small. You've separated it into two little compartments, one sleeping area, just a little bit wider than a single bed. Yeah. This is a printing machine. It's down here. At the foot of your bed is your printing machine. Yes. Your source of income. Everything is here. So. And how secure is it all here, having all your business here? Well, it is not somehow safe for us because there are other groups of people sometimes they come at night, they open up, but we just pray to God, you know. That is who we depend on now. But it means you have to stay here all the time to make sure. We have to make sure that we are all the times around. Whenever we go out or we go to some of the markets where the locals are, we have to transfer these things to one of our colleagues. Please let them be with you. Okay. Yeah, so that is it. Yeah. He returns to his hoeing, it's hot. Just imagine, digging up soil to prepare the floor of your small shack where you sleep and where you plan to run a photocopying and printing service. Hoping thieves won't simply cut through the thin plastic of your shelter to steal the few belongings you have. It's not an easy world in which to be an entrepreneur. But in these refugee settlements in northern Uganda, land is being cleared. Markets are sprouting up and small businesses are growing routes. South Sudanese refugees are making new lives for themselves. They have to. And some local Ugandans are benefiting too. It's hard work though. You want to try? No, no, thank you. Okay. Because if you can try, I'll do so much place because you might have helped me in one benefiting too. It's hard work though. You want to try? No, no thank you. Because if you can try, I'll be so much place because you might have helped me in one way there. But it's okay for it. Let me do my work. Bye. I'm John Murphy. My producer was Ruth Alexander.

But soon, that calm, welcoming atmosphere leads to something far darker, a journey that leads to allegations of grooming, trafficking and exploitation across international borders. I don't have my passport, I don't have my phone, I don't have my bank cards, I have nothing. The passport being taken, the being in a house and not feeling like they can leave.
