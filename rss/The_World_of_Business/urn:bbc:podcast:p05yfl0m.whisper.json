Thank you for listening to this BBC programme. Now, the starting point was when my colleague Estelle and I were discussing events in Catalonia, including the decision by some companies to move their headquarters out of the region. So we were wondering how we could explore this story from a business perspective. Estelle mentioned Carver and I was only too happy to follow her train of thought and this is the result. Okay, I'm just going to get some glasses out. So welcome to of all places my kitchen in south-east London. Now listen to this. Bubbles fill the glass. And all three of these bottles are sparkling wine. On the left here, champagne. And it can only be called that if it comes from the champagne region of France. In the middle, Praseco from northern Italy, which has become a very popular, cheaper party fizz. And the one I've just popped is the real reason for this introduction. It's Carver. Something like fennel or something liquidous. The freshness, but in a way a little bit of toasty nuts. Kind of bakery is the yeast. It's very rich. It has body. The bubbles are like a moose, but more soft. It's good, eh? Mmm, it's lovely. Cheers. Cheers. Cheers. The real point about Carver, though, is that while it can be made in other regions, 95% of the world's supply of Carver comes from Catalonia in northeast Spain, that part of the country which has been beset by political problems, and calls for independence. In this programme, I'll be exploring how the business of Carver has become mixed up in troubled politics, how its image has suffered, and how it's trying to reinvent itself as something more special. Now, I would invite you into my kitchen if I could, but for this story, we need a bigger space. And by the magic of radio, I can end up here in this echoy chamber, which is in fact a giant cellar. I'm surrounded by, I don't know how many, hundreds and hundreds of dusty bottles just lying here waiting and these cellars how many sellers are there more than 30 kilometers of cellars we are the largest on the world the largest wine cellars in the world that's very impressive with plenty of bottles in them millions and millions and one day they'll go pop pop Pop, open and are ready to drink. And cheers. Julia, the wine tourism manager, is showing us around the extraordinary tunnels under the equally impressive 19th century buildings of one of the largest carver producers, Kodonyu. The tunnels are so long that tens of thousands of visitors and school children who visit each year get an exciting ride on the winery's famous underground train. Obviously we couldn't miss out on the fun. Everybody remember the train. Perhaps you don't remember me in the future, but I'm sure that you remember the train trip. There are a few other points to remember, too, about that visit to this, the original home of Carver. And the first bottle of sparkling wine really arrived on 1872. So that was when Carver was really invented? When Caba was invented, yes. So we say that we are the first one that we made the bottle of Kava on Spain, on 1872. And in terms of Kava, Kordornyu, is it the largest, the second largest? The second largest. After Freshenet, which is the largest? Yes. Korni. En quantidad. Yeah. In no, no, wearnia. In quantity. Yeah. In... No, no, we say in terms of quantity. I mean... That was a kind of dig at some of their rivals and relates to that eternal debate about quantity versus quality and specifically about the fact that some wineries, and this is true not just in Carver, don't actually have their own vineyards. And when you have your own vineyards, you are sure what is of the quality of the grapes that we have got. Not everybody has vineyards. No, because that is the open secret that anybody who knows about wine knows that many wine producers buy their grapes from other people. And sometimes even buy the wine from other people. Or the bottle already. Yes. The question of how many grapes you buy in or not is a pertinent one when it comes to your image, especially if you want to sell yourself as a premium product. Before continuing, though, I needed to turn to an expert voice, a wine consultant, to give me a better insight into some of the issues surrounding the business of Carver. So standing by the walls of an ancient castle on an outcrop, looking out across the valley, there are some ridges, and I can see the hills in the distance. And next to me is El Belpucci and we're both wearing sunglasses because it's a bright blue winter's day. And you've decided we should meet here to show me what? This is the heart of Penedes which is the heart of the Kava region. Everything begins here. The history of Kava begins here. In this valley? In this valley, yes. How many producers are there of Kava here? Both. There are big, big, big companies like Cotorniou and Fresenet and Jubei camps and there are that medium-sized company like Gramona and Recarodon and this small, tiny, I mean, sometimes every little farm has a seller and produce their own caba to sell to the tourists and I was said, I mean, probably, I don't know, probably 100 of producers. And of course, CAVA itself means seller. Kava itself means seller. More than cellar specifically is aging cellar, where you put the bottles for the second fermentation and for the beginning of the aging process. That is aging seller. And that's the traditional method which they also use in champagne. Yeah, second fermentation in the bottle, and this is traditional metal champenoir. And that's what makes it different to other sparkling wines like Prosecco and other ones, which are made differently. The second fermentation is in a Vick tank. That's what we call the Grand Vass. But I think that two main areas in the world with that metal Champanoise, which is the second fermentation in the bottle, is champagne and cab and cava there are more but not well known as cava and champagne and the difference is the soil the the weather the great varieties the yields everything is different and everything is the same in terms of business cover how important is it to this region in terms of money it makes. I mean, from the farmers and the land and the wineries and all the industry around Kava, it's really, really important. I mean, Catalonia produces the 20% of food of all Spain because we have a traditional farming over here and Kava is one of the legs of the chair, I'm sure. But there's one thing at the heart of Carver that has complicated its image, especially when it tries to compete with champagne. Most Carver does come from Catalonia, however... The CAVA region is not a real region. That's the thing. I mean, you can make Cava, with the appellation of origin, in Extremadura. You can make Cava in Val mean, you can make Cava with the Appalachian of Origin in Extremadura. You can make Cava in Valencia. You can make Cava in other regions of Spain. That's it. I mean, it's one of the only applications of origin in the world that the name is not a name of a place. I mean, Borgonle is a name of a place. Champagne is a name of a place. But Cava is a seller. That's nothing. The point is, this makes it difficult to market carver as a specific product with specific attributes. Linked to that is the question of price. In its heyday in the early 20th century, carver, which was known as Champan at the time, used to compete with, well, champagne. And while you can certainly find more expensive top-quality carvers today, in more recent years, some of the big carver houses have competed at the lower end of the market, against the likes of Prosecco. And if one day the caber was competing against champagne, because they are two well-known sparkling wines and all that stuff, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Right now, they are competing against Proseco sect and all that different products. That they probably, they not make the second fermentation in the bottle. They made the fermentation in a grand vase. That's totally different. And it's a question of price because if you are doing cheap things, you will have the cheap market. But if you're doing good things you will have the cheap market but if you're doing good things you can ask for the for the high you can compete for quality or for quantity and if you choose quantity you're lost but the problem for you well problem for this region is that when i'm going around my supermarket in london where i live cover is not very expensive and I'd be shocked if I suddenly saw an expensive bottle and I probably you know think why why should I be spending that money I'm used to spending much less but if you want a good cover you will have to pay there are some covers that one 1.5 euros in the supermarket if you want to drink a good cover you have to pay I, probably less than a champagne. There are prices from 20 to 30, 40, 40, 40, 50, 60 euros. I mean, if there are good vineyards, very low yields, a long-aging process, really good varieties, really good yeast for the fermentation and all that stuff, you're doing the same that they're doing the premier grand cru class in in champagne. Price is a recurring theme in the Carver story. Alba's words about quality seemed an obvious invitation to visit a Carver house with a reputation for producing some top quality fizz. Before we get there though, let me mention something called CAVA de Parache Calificado. It's a new premium category, which has been introduced by the Carver authorities, an attempt to boost the image of this sparkling wine. There's no literal translation of Paragia, but to understand what it means, we should start at the beginning of the process, in the vineyards. There are three men here going up the lines of vines, pruning them right back. Hello. Hello. I'm periodista of the BBC. Ah, BBC? Yes. Ricaredo is one of just nine carver houses that's attained the new strict parahe qualification, in this case for two of its sparkling wines, including a costly one called Turo-denmota. Here they pride themselves on using traditional methods. And in 2014, these organic producers made the decision to use only local grape varieties, both for reasons of identity. And also, I'm told, since the grapes are more adapted to the climate in Catalonia, for survival. Noria, you're the winemaker for Recarredo. Yeah. Tell me about this particular vineyard. Is there something special about it? Well, we are replanted all of our vineyards again in the traditional system because we consider that it's better because of our climate trying to fight to the climate change that we have here. And indeed, I understand that in the last few years you've had a lack of rain. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We have several lack of water since 2015 and it's a big problem. So for that we are trying to think in the best way to manage our vineyards to try to win this situation. Walking into your offices earlier and there were some cover bottles in glass cabinets including one at the end for 108 euros, which was your latest cava de Parage. So it was your most expensive one. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And this is this new category. What's so important about that? What makes that one different? We always say that Trudemota, it's a very special cover, because it's only one vineyard. It's just one hect or less than one hectare, in fact. So you have three characteristics here. A single vinger, a single vintage and a single variety, local grape variety Sharello. And for us, we think that express the cheruard in a high level. And at the end, maybe it can sound very poetical, but it's like we feel what we do. We wanted to express in a bottle this singular place, this singular vineyard. The man joining in the conversation is Santee. He may have poetry in him, but he's also in charge of Recaredo's corporate image. Part of our business model is based on the laws of the nature. Now, I know that you didn't start in the wine business. You've come from outside. So do you not sometimes think this is a bit crazy, this model? Absolutely. I think it's very crazy, because we are 30 people working at Recaredo and two horses. 30 people in two horses? And two horses. Let's not forget the horses. Not forget them. They are part of the team. And yeah, the first time I have an experience here at Rokaredo and I saw the extreme philosophy of working with own vineyards, hand harvesting all the vines, dry farming, not irrigate, all the beneficiation is made on the property, all the aging is done with a natural corkestoper. I mean, everything is very extreme. On the other hand, I think that this kind of philosophy is what makes me feel that I'm working in a unique place. And we enjoy being extreme because we think that we are making not a sparkling wine, but an ambassador of our territory, of the Pannadesk County. And maybe the new qualified Parage category of Kava is a step beyond because first time in history, designation of origin, Cava, talks about a place. A specific place. A specific place, not only about the method. It focused on the place. It's easy to get lost in the poetry and romance of wine-making, perhaps more so if there are bubbles involved. But in the end, of course, it is a business. And that sense of place that Santi's talking about is at the heart of Parache. Up this one your staircase. And the man at the top of the stairs is Pirebonette. Up this one your staircase. And the man at the top of the stairs is Pire Bonnet. But English, I have a class now. You have an English class every day? I am a student. I am a student. A bad student. Well, we're not here to discuss English. I'm here to discuss Carver. Mr. Bonnet comes from the family that owns the. We're here to discuss Carver. Mr. Bonnet comes from the family that owns the biggest and probably best-known Carver house, Freshonet. I think that for the brands, the low cost is that we need more added value to survive in the industry, to survive in the market. Pere Bonnet wears another hat too, president of the Concejo Regulador del Cava, Kava's regulatory council, which laid down the rules for the new Parage Calificado. The objective was have better image, better image of the brand, Cava, because it's very, very important to have more quality. And why is it so important to improve the quality now? The quality of cover is very good in general. You can do a blind test against another sparkling, price by price. The cover is wonderful. But the cover is more known through the medium segment. Yes, it's not known as an expensive luxury product. It's at maximum $10 a bottom. That means that the consumer and the expert says Kava is cheap. Cheap, is what you're saying. Yes, yeah. But is that partly Kava's fault that in the past, Carver sold itself too cheaply? Yeah. Including your, your house, Fresh Annette, perhaps. Yeah, yeah, of course, but we have wonderful covers. There are some unique special covers, and I say this special covers can be the example of the excellence of the general carver. To produce these Parraje ultra-premium carvers, stringent conditions have to be met. Among them, the vines must be at least 10 years old. The grapes must come from a specific vineyard or a single estate. There are restrictions on grape yields and the carver has to be aged for at least three years in the bottle, which brings us to another stage in the process. This is a river. Ribba is the situation where the yeast are now living with the product. Oh yes, you've picked up bottled and you can see the yeast. You can see how the yeast are here. The yeast eat the sugar and make a second fermentation in a bottle. This is metachepenolus. And it has a bit like a sort of Coke bottle top on the top. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Giusepudge is the general manager and CEO of Sumeroka. And that co-called beer bottle cap remains as the pressures build up during the second fermentation. You know that the cover cannot put in the market before nine months? So the second aging has to be minimum nine months. Yeah, but in our case, we only produce reserves and grand reserves. So our cabas go to the market after at least 15 months. Do you keep some even longer than 15 months? Yes, yeah, Grand Reserves and Nourias are at least half between three and four years. This is the problem, the financial cost of the stocking. So this is quite different, imagine with Prosecco. They make second fermentations in a big tanks. In 20 days you have a Prosecco in the table. So your whole process is much more expensive than Prosecco? Of course. Our process is so expensive like Champagne. And yet in many shops and supermarkets, the price of a bottle of Carver is akin to the price of a bottle of Prosecco. Back above ground in Sumeroka's vineyards, we discussed the relationship between price and quality. What is quality? Quality is a perception. The problem of Kava is perception. It's not quality. The price of the Kava doesn't help for the perception. So you could just put up the price. Yeah, it's our job. And then that'll change the perception. No, my job is that. But at the end, if the price is low, that gives a bad perception. Then if the price is low, you don't have budget for promoting. If you don't promote, you find that perhaps a young man, young woman in the United Kingdom, for them, caba is something strange. So this is one thing in general. And what about the specifics of the Cava de Parrahe Calificado as a means of improving carver's overall image? Well, Josette Pooge isn't against the idea per se of having top-of-the-range carvers. But I think also that this will fall down. What, this whole plan will collapse? Yeah, because we must build a general image for cover, a general. And we don't have any unique selling proposition about cover. So how would you improve the image of cover? Much more budget. Riaja has 10 million euros. Kava has one million euros. What do you mean? Where's that budget come from? Promotional budget. Only paying 0.04 euros per bottle, we will have the same budget as Rioja. Without money, you cannot communicate. Without communication, you have this pretty stupid word that good relation, quality, price. A good relation between quality and price. Yeah, this is a typical that is said in cover. Ah, we have the best quality price relation. This is nothing. At the end, you need a very good unique selling proposition and you need money to have this very selling proposition. In your head, are you Catalan? Yeah. Are you from Catalonia? Of course. Why do Catalans say, of course? I ask that question. Yes. We're now entering the territory of politics. During the recent uncertainty surrounding the independence referendum in Catalonia, some companies announced they were moving their headquarters outside the region, that included Cordonius holding company. And although Carver is also made in other regions, for many Catalans and Spaniards in general, it is a Catalan product. included Cordonius holding company. And although Carver is also made in other regions, for many Catalans and Spaniards in general, it is a Catalan product. So some people in Spain, opposed to independence, called for a boycott of Carver. Albert Pudge, the wine consultant we met earlier, told me it had also led to some sharp practice. Because of the political problems, the production outside Catalonia has boomed for more than 100% every year because they sell... They're saying, this is CAPA, not made in Catalonia, to sell more. I mean, it's made from Spanish grapes, not Catalan grapes and all that stuff. And they said this, just to throw more gasoline, petrol, in the fire to sell more. So the producers from outside Catalonia boast that they make Kava from outside Kavana. And this is forbidden. You cannot put this in the label. And some of them, they put this in the label. Many of those we came across didn't want to discuss politics. But with the president of Carver's regulatory council, Perebonnet, the politics couldn't be ignored. Why did Cordorneu move the headquarters? What was the point of that? I don't know. Surely you have an idea. No, no, no. As Fricksonet, if Catalonia declares the independence, we need to move our headquarters because we need export. So are you discussing this in the family? Yeah, of course. If the independence, yeah. If independence happens? Happens. We need to be European because we export to Europe, to Belgium, to Germany, more Kava than in Spain. We need to sell that and not pay taxes. Catalonia might be outside the EU. Sure. So if Catalonia becomes independent, that could be a big disaster for the Kver industry here. For some of the brands, yes, as Codor Niu, as Frasinet, and the branch who are exported to Europe in a big quantities. For the small sellers, no, because they don't export. And then it's no problem. It's the domestic market always. But if they want to be European market, they need to be in Europe. So making Kava in the first place is a very difficult thing. And then the whole business is complicated by the fact that Kava doesn't have a strictly defined geographical region like champagne. And it appears to also be sending out a confusing image to the consumer. Is it a cheap, sparkling wine, or is it something rather more special? And the background to all this is that most of it is made in Catalonia, a region which is undergoing political turmoil at the moment. It is true there are some cheap carvers out there, but there are also some great carvers. The question is whether quality or quantity will come to be associated with this sparkling wine. Ah, it's your... Let me introduce you, Jordi Matta is one of the third generations. Hello, hello. And Sorin, English. He's from the family. Yeah, his grandfather was the founder of the cabas. So we put business aside and we're back in Recaredo with Nuria, the winemaker, and Jordi, who's going to demonstrate the final stages of the making of Kava. Oh look, he's doing it. The yeast have done their work. The bottles are gently shaken to encourage the yeast down to the neck. Here in Recaredo, they eschew mechanisation and do everything by hand. Then comes the disgorgement, removing the bottle stopper and the pressure inside expels the dead yeast. At least, that's the theory. Normally a disgorger needs two years to learn how to disgorge. They feel very bad when they lose a bottle. Let's go close. He's showing that the bottle is pointing downwards and where the cork is, there's a sort of mush of dead yeast. The exact moment. As he holds the base of the bottle against his belly, he's got his finger on top of the cork holding it in and he's got a pair of pliers in his right hand and he's smiling at me and the slow and fast okay finish gosh that was really quick slow and very fast. And he's now just put a cork on top. He's now putting the metal cage on top of the cork and squeezing that on. And there we are. There's a finished bottle of carver and it's clean.
