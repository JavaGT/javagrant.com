The first thing that hit me was the amazing sweet smell. And then the lines and lines of bright berries going along conveyor belts. There was a lot of movement. And I became intrigued by how the whole business worked. lines of bright berries going along conveyor belts. There was a lot of movement. And I became intrigued by how the whole business worked. So with my producer Sally, we went back there. Good morning. Okay. Nice to see you. Yeah, you too. Early hours. Yeah, that's fine. It's half past six on a warm spring day as we reached Tim Chambers' soft fruit farm in Kent in South East England, the start of the season and the pickers have been up even earlier than we have. Is this normal for you? Time? Yeah, it's fairly normal. It gets earlier actually. Does it? Does it? Early in the morning it's cooler, so fruits better kept and picked cool. There's so much to do, and a limited time, and so many people and so much fruit to pick. I've stepped away for a few moments from Tim's farm, and I'm in my local supermarket car park and I've got some berries here four packets of berries I remember when I was young much younger than now it was actually really exciting when the berry season began in the summer you could get the fresh fruit and super exciting as a schoolboy occasionally going to one of those pick your own farms and stuffing my face of strawberries with a juice dripping down my chin and onto my hands and uh-oh staining my shirt fruity fruity fruity fruity fruity fruity fruity fruity fruity fruity fruity fruity fruity fruity taking a look at these particular berries i've bought today i can see that the strawberries they're British strawberries they come from Kent but the raspberries are from Spain and the blackberries here from Portugal and these blueberries are from Morocco and I have seen blueberries that come all the way from Mexico and Peru nowadays you can find this fruit on your supermarket shelves 365 days a year. So how does this constant supply actually happen and at what cost and indeed at what price? Welcome to in-business. Tim Chambers inherited a 35-acre farm near Maidstone from his father. His business, W.B. Chambers, now has a thousand acres of berries spread across Kent. These days, much of the fruit is grown in polytunnels, vast metal frames covered with plastic, protecting the fruit from the elements, and allowing the growing season to begin earlier and end later. Get out. Let's see, look, here we are. Yes, I was going to put it. We're on a little track in between, well, loads of polytunnels, to my right, stretching off how far is that? That's hundreds of meters. 300 meters that way and another pretty much 300 meters that way. Yes. So you've got 600 meters lengthwise and width wise. Oh, width wise oh width wise probably another 300 meters and a lot of plants yes 900,000 plants in this field and this is just one of your 14 sites yes 900,000 plants and they all hopefully will yield one to 1.2 kilos each plant each plant so that gets our thousand tons you are a big producer. No, no, we're not. We're not. Relatively, we are relatively, we're a fairly small strawberry producer. On raspers, we are one of the larger ones, if not the largest one. And which makes better money? Margin wise, at the moment, strawberries. Let's go and have look at some of them. The strawberries aren't grown in soil anymore, but in metal trays. The plant roots are supported by a framework made of shredded coconut husks, and their drip-fed a cocktail of nutrients. The point of all this plant pampering is to get a better controlled environment to ensure a steady supply of tasty fruit with a longer shelf life and so satisfy the demands of the supermarkets. Tim's got banana in his hands but we're looking at these strawberries and this is an extraordinary site going off for we've decided about 300 meters in the distance i've got plants almost at shoulder height on my right and on my left and i can see i don't know well millions of strawberries just hanging down some of which are bright red many of which are still very, very green. So the trick is obviously to pick the right ones. Yes, I mean, the pickers are trained to pick strawberries which are fully red. So for example, if we turn this one round, you can see that underneath the colour is still a little bit white. So that's not suitable for picking yet. There is some skill to recognising all this. Yes, yeah, no, there is. And not squishing the strawberry whilst you're doing it. No, it is manual labour, but it's not low skilled. The people who come to work here, probably the skill they have is first of all recognising the fruit. And the second thing is the ability just to keep on going for hour after hour picking fruit. Yeah, how many hours a day do they do? Well, they'll do eight hours. Sometimes if we're pushed, we'll go to 10, 11 hours. Thank you. The berry business is labour intensive, with much of the picking done by women. In peak summer, Tim needs up to 1,500 pickers. 99% of his workforce comes from Bulgaria and Romania. They're here for the season, usually living in caravans on the farm and returning home again when the season's over. You can probably hear the leaves rustling as Eleanor, who's 23, hunts out the ripe berries, placing them into plastic punnets on trays, in the trolley she's wheeling along. How much are you earning, would you say? 354400 and 400 per week. Yeah, 350, 400 and 400 something pound per week. It depends on how much she works and what she does, basically. Okay. And what time did you start this morning? 5 o'clock. Wow. So what time did you get up in the morning? Wake up? 4 o'clock. 4 o'clock. Is that tough? No, yeah. It is difficult, yes. And I know it's about money, but explain to me, why have you come to England? Why aren't you back in Bulgaria trying to earn money there? Okay, I'm for money. Why are you about to be, why you're working in Bulgaria? Because in Bulgaria, I can't earn as much as I can earn here. Simple. How many strawberries do you think you're going to be picking today? More than 40 boxes maybe more which is how much oh it's about 150 kilos or something 150 kilos even more what about the work do you actually like it heresfully the she she likes the harvest in the most it's time for our translator an important member of the team, to introduce himself. Salih Hodghov is my name. So I come from South Bulgaria, from a very small village on the Greek border. Sally knows everything about the business. He came to us 18 years ago as a picker from Bulgaria, and now is basically running the farm. My first year when I came here, I used to pick strawberries and I earned in one day 68 pounds. I remember even the number because that's a very interesting number. And my father's wages were 50-something euros per month. So I remember this was the exchange rate. I used to earn for one day as much as my father could earn for one month in Bulgaria. It was crazy. Wow. Big, big, big difference. The workers here in Kent get the minimum wage but can earn more the more they pick. But there's uncertainty of a Britain's departure from the European Union. Meanwhile, the Bulgarian economy has strengthened and if the pound weakens Meanwhile, the Bulgarian economy has strengthened, and if the pound weakens further, fruit picking in the UK may become less appealing. The exchange rate is the biggest factor. When I came first here, the pound was 3 level 15, now it's 2.10. It's a big difference in the exchange rate. So it's less... It's financially interesting to come here? It is. For Bulgarian and Romanians, it's 210 it's a big difference in the exchange rate so it's less it's financially interesting to come here it is for Bulgarian and Romanians it's less attractive so this is why the next country which will be coming here should be in the similar stage the exchange should be really big so it makes it attractive for people to come but maybe in the next four or five years if if Bulgaria is going up then a lot of the pound doesn't do so well because I remember when I first came here we had a lot of Polish workers Slovakian Czech and now virtually there is one or two Polish and one or two of the Lithuanians and that's it quite a few of them are going back to Poland or Lithuania so the nature of the workforce in terms of the countries they come from changes with time? 10 or 15 years and then there's another country and then maybe another country and then it's another country. It's constantly changing, yes. With political pressures to reduce immigration into the UK, there are worries about where those seasonal workers will come from in future. Already the numbers from the EU have dropped significantly. UK agriculture as a whole needs about 90,000 seasonal workers. There's even talk of bringing them in from Nepal, as already happens elsewhere in Europe. The sector is absolutely desperate. At the moment, the sector is struggling to find enough workers from the EU. So we have to look wider if we want to have a successful agricultural sector going forwards. Steph Morel, the chief executive of Concordia, a charity that helps supply seasonal migrant labour for farmers like Tim Chambers, came to meet us at his farm. She says UK agriculture is already missing 10,000 seasonal workers. And what does that mean to the farmers if they've got this shortage? If you've got no workforce, you're literally stand looking at your field with no one to pick it. You do not have fruit and veg pick and you do not eat fresh British fruit and veg in supermarkets. The government launched a pilot scheme late last year, actually is based on an old scheme, that allows non-EU workers into the UK for six months, from places like Belarus, Ukraine and Moldova. But numbers are limited, only 2,500. From where I'm sitting, I'm really worried about the labour situation for the UK. If we've been short over 10,000 for two years a row, and predicting more shortages this year with no real plan for the sector going forwards, apart from the hope that the government will increase the pilot numbers, then that's a real worry for Concordia, but also for every single farmer in the UK. So sadly, the pickers, mainly women, have gone on a well-deserved break. Yes. Now I can see quite a few of them are coming back and after 15, 20 minutes and they'll start again. And it's in their interest to pick as many as they can because they get paid. The more they harvest, the more money they earn. And actually, if they save £8 or £900 per month for six months, then they can go back and live for six months virtually without doing anything. And that is attractive. And the army of women is returning from their break, collecting more empty plastic trays to carry on picking and carry on with their work and carry on earning money. We've just overtaken one of your workers who's got a few punnets of strawberries Yes. On her trolley. So we've now into an area of the row where we haven't yet picked today and you can see there's a lot more strawberries ready. You're looking for strawberries that show red all over and once you find one. Like this one? Yes, just like that one. You take your thumb and forefinger and you just pinch. You pinch the stalk? You pinch the stalk, yes. So you try not to hold the fruit too much? We try not to hold the fruit. No, the fruit is quite delicate. It's huge. Yes. The first fruits... It's like three centimeters or two and half centimeters. The first fruits on the plant are always very large. They're the king fruit. And then they get smaller. And then they get smaller as the crop goes through. It is nice. So that variety is Morano. Mmm. And what is that is that common variety here? It's a, yeah, it's a commercial variety. Lots of people grow. It's very sweet. Though there is a hint of, I don't know, what do you call it? It tastes like a strawberry, doesn't it? I don't don't know a hint of a mother smile on a warm sunny day strawberries have the sort of sweetness with a little bit of acidity they do yes the sugar acid balance gives it the good flavour obviously someone's getting something right thanks to better varieties intensive marketing campaigns and the trumpeted health benefits. There's been a 400% increase in berry sales in the UK in less than 20 years, much of it in the last five. And yet prices for farmers haven't gone up. When I grew swivel years ago, I was getting more per kilo on the wholesale market than I get now. Well, that doesn't sound very good. Business for you. But we are much better at getting high yields. By raising the strawberries into tabletops, we've reduced the picking cost. Even though the minimum wage have grown up significantly, I think when it first came in, it was about $3.50 an hour, and now it's $8.20. So your labour costs have rocketed? Oh, rocketed, yes. But we've constantly found ways of managing to keep costs under control. Some of it's come from big capital investments like these growing structures. So you've got to put a lot more money in up front now than you ever used to. The commercial soft fruit businesses are nothing like they were 20 years ago whereas before 20 30,000 pound invested in the winter to put down new fields or to plant more orchards now is two three four million so you need to find the money somewhere you don't have it in your back pocket no there's nothing in my back pocket at all, actually. So who invests in these things? We are able to get money from European fruit and vegetable scheme, which helps us with capital costs. It is an EU scheme as part of the Common Agricultural Policy. So they can loan you money? They actually give us money. They give you money. Free money? The subsidy which is given to us by the EU allows us to effectively produce crops at or in some cases below price. So what's going to happen when or if we leave the Common Agricultural Policy and you don't get this money? Well, our government will probably keep subsidizing farming because the government from a social point of view do not want to see food prices rise because that will affect inflation. But your industry will have to have some kind of subsidy to keep going unless the prices we shoot up. We can put the prices up. It comes down to simple mathematics. If I as a business do not feel that the reward I get from the risks I take isn't sufficient, then I would stop doing it. These women have been super quick with their work. They've been back from their break for, I don't know, 20 minutes or so, half an hour. And they've already filled up all their plastic trays. And now they're going to be loaded up onto a truck and a trailer. Fast work. Obviously keen to get their money. And of course, the fruit, if I'd done it, they'd all be a bit bashed and I would have chosen the wrong ones, but they've seemed to have chosen pretty well. Nice red fruit and not a mark on it. As soon as the trailers are full, the berries are taken to be refrigerated nearby. It's important to get the field heat out of the fruit as quickly as possible, to prevent it softening up and to keep it fresh. Then about half an hour's drive away, just outside Maidstone, we reach a place where trucks are coming and going. This is where the Chamber's pack house is getting fruit ready for dispatch to the supermarkets. As well as packing his own crops, Tim's business takes in fruit from other farmers, including berries imported from around the world, especially outside the UK growing season. It makes commercial sense. The supermarkets demand fruit 52 weeks a year, and he can sweat his assets make the most of them then there's the staff to consider too we have to have skilled experienced people working for us so we can't get those skilled people to be seasonal the same as we can pickers so we need to give them 12-month-year jobs because otherwise they would disappear and then we couldn't recruit and find staff to start up again in April, May the following year. It just wouldn't happen. So we find a job that they can do which actually generates an income for the farm. And that's through importing? It's through importing, yeah. And service provision for other importers. To get a more complete picture of the business, we've travelled to southern Spain with one of Tim Chambers' staff, Mirren Pereth. We're a 30-minute drive west of Seville. Okay, Mirren, where are you going to take us today? I'm going to take you to a musa fruit because it's one of the main growers we work with in Spain. Sending fruit back to Kent, back to England. In parking for supermarkets. Miriam's job is to keep the relationship going with the farm, to agree prices and to buy berries from them. The growing seeds from them. The growing seasons coming to an end here in southern Spain. These workers are busy picking the last of the raspberries. Like much of the seasonal workforce, Amina is from Morocco. She's been a fruit picker in Spain for 14 years. The whole family's in Morocco. Mother, father, brothers, children. And she got a daughter that is 17 years old. And she lives in Morocco. So you've been in Spain for 14 years. Has your daughter always remained in Morocco? Where is your daughter? In Morocco? Yes. No, I do. She said that she left her daughter in Morocco and she's going to school and she cannot take her here because she's working so she cannot look after her. How has it felt leaving your child behind for 14 years to grow up in Morocco? Yeah, she's saying that her daughter lives with her mom and dad. So with the grandparents, yes. She's saying that every month she's sending money back home and she's just trying to survive. Yeah, she's saying of course she's missing her daughter. But it strikes me what she's saying to us. It's very normal for her to come to Spain, to earn money. That's just natural life for her and to leave her family behind. She has said a few times that she's just here trying to survive to earn money and she understands that this is what she has to do. It's not clear how much longer Spanish fruit farmers will be able to rely on a steady supply of workers from Morocco like Amina. As Miryan says, there's competition on all sides. Morocco's production is growing quite fast. Oh, production of fruit as well? Yes. So they have grown quite a lot in the past couple of years, growing raspberries, strawberries, and they are starting now with blueberries so it could be the case where there is enough jobs in Morocco and obviously they will decide to stay there I mean we're speculating here of course a bit but that could also mean that the competition from the berry industry in Morocco could undermine the berry industry here in Spain? Yes, we have seen it this year slightly. In January, February, there was a big crash on the raspberry production because there was a peak in Morocco and there were good volumes here. So it affects the price quite a lot. Too many raspberries, yes. And next year there are plans in Morocco to grow more. So it will definitely affect the Spanish supply. As we all know by now, after picking, the fruit has to be sorted. Here we go, washing up our hands again. That's my law. By law, yeah. That's by law. By law, yeah. And I can know. Because we're in the pack house. You have to push it at the end. Oh, I can recognize some of the pickers from this morning. They were picking raspberries this morning and now in this pack house they are by hand sorting through the strawberries and putting them into punnets and weighing them. There are no conveyor belts or other machines here. It's all done by hand. The berries are then sent by truck to Tim's farm in Kent, where they're re-weighed and repackaged for the UK supermarkets. Like chambers, emusa fruit relies heavily on migrant labour. But for the company's boss, Salvatore Muno Zammudio, one of the biggest problems is reliability. He's saying that one day there are 20 people don't show up. The day after, there are 15. Yesterday, he said that there were 27 people that were meant to come, and they didn't come, and the total said that there were 27 people that were meant to come and they didn't come and the total number of workers were 50 people so 27 out of 50 is quite high that must have a major impact on your business right i have a reunion the same coming with embassad of food america he got a meeting next week with some of the embassies in civil from people from South America in order to get people coming from there and stay here this season. Yesterday you were expecting 50, 27 did not turn up. What's the immediate impact? He had to stop picking two parcels or two patches of land yes because you don't have people you walk away of crops that are good quality and you can still sell it but you cannot pick it so I mean if that happens a lot does that mean that you're losing a lot of your crop? Yes. Thank you. Yes. Yes. Another country, and as you might be able to tell, another packhouse. We're back at W. WB Chambers in Kent. It's busier and more mechanised than Salvatore's place. Everything's moving fast. We need to pack and get through, say, in this pack house, up to 250, 300,000 punits a day have to leave. Picked, packed, gone. All to get the fresh fruit onto supermarket shelves within a day or a day and a half of being picked. Tim Chambers spends much of his time on his mobile phone trying to match supply with demand. After three decades of growing his business, the details are part of his DNA. Those trays over there. The big green plastic ones. I know where they're going to. I'm not sure I can tell you. Are you just being clever clocks? No, I just know that different supermarkets have different types of trays. So that's going to one of the, what they call the discontors. The talk of discounters begs the question often raised, do the supermarket squeeze farmers like him to keep prices down? A supermarket wouldn't be a good supermarket unless it was pushing the prices down as hard as it could. You have to. Otherwise farmers, if I'm not pushed to sell at a cheaper price or become more efficient, I will get lazy and if I can ask whatever price I want then my business becomes fat and unable to go forward. I wasn't sure if Tim was being, let's say, diplomatic in his response. Capital outlay and labour costs especially have gone up significantly in recent years and yet by and large, very prices on supermarket shelves have stayed the same. Good for the consumers' pocket, yes, but what will it ultimately mean for homegrown production? There would be a tipping point where the labour becomes so expensive, we either have to invest in robots to get rid of it, or we stop. At the moment, those robots are extremely expensive, and they can't match the speed and skill of human pickers. But somebody needs to make the berries or grow the berries for extremely expensive and they can't match the speed and skill of human pickers. But somebody needs to make the berries or grow the berries for us to eat it. Somebody will be in, hopefully they'll be in this country, but if the public are happy to import more and more percentage of their foods, then that's what the public will do. We shouldn't be sentimental about it. You can't go against this, can't be sentimental about it. You can't go against this, can't swim against the tide. I will be a taxi driver. I'm John Murphy.
