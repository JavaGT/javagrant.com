In this programme, Ruth Alexander delves deep into the UK's recycling industry, starting with her own bin. This is not good, it's meant to be clean. This is definitely a no-no. So you need like yoghurt parts, parts of cream, things like that? You need us to give them clean? Please, yeah. Wash clean, please. Yeah. Okay, that's going out too. I've invited refuse collector Rowan Munder and colleagues to inspect my recycling. It's not going well. I didn't put that in, that's my neighbour. That's a washing up bowl. Is that okay? It's only paper and cardboard, plastic bottles, pots and trays. Not washing up bowls. This is the next thing, yeah? Basically, yeah, we don't take this. This is definitely a no-no. Really? Sorry, this bin is a no-no. Oh no. Oh no. The reason it's so important to get everything in the right bin is a business story. Where there's muck, there's brass. Your rubbish is a commodity. Old yoghobots and newspapers present a money-making opportunity that some say isn't fully exploited in the UK. So in this week's in business, I'm going to be finding out who makes money out of what we throw away. And on the trail of our recycling, I've discovered a multi-billion dollar industry that's global and in turmoil. Oh, and that my neighbours are better at recycling than I am. Look at this really nice, clean ones. Look, see everything is almost clean. This is good, clean, nice recycling. This is fast in flying colors. Once he's collected the recycling, Roanmunda takes it to be sorted, the first stage in turning it into money. Our objective is to try to mine anything that is valuable there because we want to recycle it. We want to put it back into the loop and produce new commodities with it. Raquel Carrasco, technology director at Violia, a French-owned giant in the recycling and waste management industry, gives me a tour of a sorting plant she helped design. All around me are dozens of conveyor belt moving up and down, shifting piles of rubbish across a huge warehouse. A small team of people wearing gloves, masks and earplugs silently pick over the piles, throwing out the stuff we shouldn't have put in our recycling bins. All of the materials come in co-mingles, so all mixed together. Through this big conveyor belt, which is where we identify any big pieces of contaminants, which can actually damage the plant. What's the most outrageous things people put in our recycling beds? I have seen something such a head of a dog, for example, going through a conveyor belt. Absolutely. A head of a dog? Yeah, we have some people in some areas who may not get the message right. What message are they listening to? What are people thinking? After the initial sifting, the machines take over, sorting three-dimensional objects from flat, paper from plastic. This is kind of my favourite. What this machine does is that it emits light onto the objects, and depending on how much light is absorbed and how much is reflected, the computer inside can recognise what type of material it is. The machines detecting plastic, but there are lots of different types of plastic and they all have to be separated out from one another if there to have any recycling value. And that can be difficult, even impossible. You can have a bottle with three different types of plastic in it. In one bottle? In one bottle. So the top is one polymer, the bottle itself is another polymer, and then you've got the wrapping around the bottle. The manufacturers and the retailers are really not making your job easy at all. You look about a can of drink. It's one material, and the machine can sort it. Okay, it can have a bit of contamination inside, but it's one unique material. When you look about plastics, we've made our lives so complicated. It becomes almost an impossible tax sometimes. And as a business, you're presumably competing on contamination levels. The purer your product at the end of this process, the greater the edge you have on your competitors. Absolutely. The better households sort their rubbish. The simpler brands make their packaging. the greater the edge you have on your competitors? Absolutely. The better households sort their rubbish, the simpler brands make their packaging, the easier it is for the machine, and the more money that can be made. Neil Grunden runs a family waste collection and sorting business in Berkshire. Is that a sequel? No, that's the scarer. I was just thinking that is the loudest seagull I've ever heard. Worst thing is, if they pick bits of plastic up, they could drop it in reservoirs, and they seem to be litter bugs. Once it's sorted, your recycling becomes rich pickings for business people too. Neil Grunden talked me through the next stage, finding a buyer. Oh, so we're now walking along, well, it's an avenue of rubbish bails, way above our heads about one, two, three, three rubbish bells high, square, and this is what you've sorted. This is genuine recyclable rubbish. Precisely. What we've done is we've taken all of those constituent bits apart and now we've put them back together again. So behind you, you've got your KLS or cardboard as you know it. KLSU carboard to me. And mixed papers behind us, behind you over there, we've got some bales of aluminium, bales of HDPE, and that will all be ready to be shipped around the world. So where will this rubbish now go? Okay, so you've got to stop calling it rubbish, Ruth. It's recycling. Sorry, sorry. Where will this recycling? Now we'll go. So the bales behind you could be in Brazil in two weeks' time, or they could be in India, or they could be in Frankfurt. But how do you find a buyer? So we tend to use brokers, and the brokers will be working with shipping companies and also with their end customer which tends to be a mill. And I think people would be surprised to know that the rubbish that they've thrown in their bin here, some of it will be recycled elsewhere in the UK but some far, far away abroad. The UK mills are full, so they've got as much paper as they can handle. So there is no more capacity there. The costs of shipping paper are minimal because most of our ships are leaving our shores empty because we're not exporting enough as a nation. We import. All we're dealing with is raw commodities. So this paper is as well used in India and in China as it is in Azerbaijan. You know, it is a, it's something that can be moved anywhere in the world. There seems to be some sort of a shame about the fact that we're making money out of sending our recyclables around the world. I don't see what the shame is in that at all. This is a great UK exporting success story. People think we're sending our rubbish to be dealt with elsewhere and they expect that their recycling is done here. If we've consumed this material here then we should deal with it. That's the logic people have. I suppose so but they don't apply the same logic about where they buy their goods and services from. They buy those from all around the world. And they don't care where that product's made or packaged. It could be Chinese packaging that we're just shipping back. So our recycling is traded like any other commodity in the global marketplace. And the truth is, we've needed China to take our recycling. The UK doesn't manufacture much. We throw away a lot. It's cheap to send our recyclable waste to the biggest manufacturer in the world, who can then turn it into new products to sell back to us. China has been a big customer for Neil Grunden. It's been buying a large proportion of the paper he sorts. Pretty much 60% of it. I mean, we'll ship anywhere in the world. We're not fixed on one particular country. But China has been a huge market. It's been a massive market. World's biggest market, not just for the UK. I mean, we're a tiny percentage of what they're taking in from Australia, North America. A huge amount of the world's discarded paper, metals and plastic has been going to China for recycling. But a few months ago, this convenient arrangement came to an abrupt end. China officially says no to foreign garbage, announced Chinese state TV. It outright bans some types of waste, and on others impose new standards which are so tough they amount to a de facto ban. So what's happened in China is that they've moved from a 2.5% contamination to a 0.5 contamination. What does that mean? Okay, so this bail behind you, you might see a crisp packet hanging out of one of them. In that cardboard bail there, I can see... A cola. Yeah, that shouldn't be in there. Don't tell our buyers that. If they spot that, they're going to reject that bail. This is the concern. Now, you might have one Coke can or one crisp packet, and then the risk of the entire load being returned from China is the reason that we're not shipping out there at the moment. China's decision to stop buying the contents of foreign recycling bins has sent a shockwave through the global recycling industry and hit prices hard. This bundle here, how much is that worth to you? So that bail there is about half a tonne. So two of those bales is about 50 quid. It's been up as high as 100, and we've been as low as zero. What it's going to be like in two months' time, I can tell you. 50 quid a ton, you're happy with that? We're happy with 50 quid a ton for cardboard, but mixed papers at the moment, we're getting around zero. Which means Neil Grunden's now having to pay someone to take his paper away. These prices are also a problem for the middlemen who trade in recycling. Hello. Thanks so much. Lovely car. In a good breath. It's a working man's car. It's a good business to be in, though. Well, I've always felt recycling is the business of the century, in my opinion. Ranjit Singh-Baksi's been profiting from exporting the UK's recycling for decades. His sleep car matches his immaculate dress. Think long black coat, red scarf, Kashmir probably, maroon turban. He cuts his deals in a humble office above a parade of shops in East London. Thank you. Immediately met by your filing system here in the corridor. What do you do? It's so much paper, plastic. Doing business with China, we need to have a license from them. Until you have this license, you cannot export them. So this certificate framed on your wall? Is it a certificate from... It's called ACUSIQ certification. In other words, your company has been weighted and approved by the government of China to allow you to export recyclable material to that country. How much of your business was with China? My business is well over 80% with China. Wow. So this is a real challenge for you. And I'm enjoying it because I think it's a wake-up call for me because I too was a little bit laid back approach thinking I have a steady market in China like so many others. You're just back from a trip to Vietnam. Yes, right. Were you looking for new customers? Yes, certainly. I mean, I mean, I was in fact really pleased and proud to say that the Vietnamese gave me a very good welcome and they also saw the opportunity that they had and how much we were looking to them to build up business partnership. So what did you see in Vietnam? What sort of companies were you visiting? Well I visited plastic plants that were manufacturing plastic soft drink bottles. I visited plastic plants that will making ports and pens and trays in the market. I visited other plastic users who were making computer casing. So I just was on an investigative trip. China's been recycling so much of the world's waste, it will be hard to fill the gap. There have been rumours of plastic and paper mountains piling up in the UK and abroad. But Ranjit Baxi insists new markets will be found. Vietnam is ready to jump into action and say, I want a part a slice of the cake. Yes, they won't be able to take everything they went to China. But then you've got Vietnam, you got Indonesia, you got Thailand, you got India, you got Sri Lanka, you got Taiwan, all these markets will be there. So I think market forces will realign themselves. And in a matter of 12 to 18 months, we won't feel that we are missing China. But why don't we just recycle our rubbish in the UK? The Chinese decision could present an opportunity to invest and grow the industry. We've discovered there are fundamental problems which make recycling a risky business and discourage investment. And almost everyone we've spoken to about this has told us the story of Chris Dow. So here he is to tell it himself. I saw it as a great opportunity to pioneer something very special and do something special with my life. A little over 10 years ago, Chris Dow was living in his native Australia, raising his family and working in business. When he spotted the chance to open up a recycling plant in the UK, it would take in old plastic milk bottles and recycle them. It was one of the first reprocessing factories of its kind. Such was the promise of the fledgling recycling industry. Chris Dow moved his family halfway around the world to England and put a lot of money into the venture. At first, things went well. It was sort of like having our own little oil well out there in Dagenham, but it was using waste bottles. Initially, it was profitable. Initially, it was a great idea, but not only was it going to be profitable, but it was going to be an outstanding win for the environment. Christel called the company Closed Loop, a play on the idea of the circular economy, a vision for the future championed by the likes of the European Union, where products are recycled and reused in a kind of virtuous circle that benefits business and the environment. It was a really good field business, and you know, we had 110 people working there, and I used to look at the front belt and marvel sometimes to myself that all those bottles used to be thrown in a landfill and now they drive a plant that employs 110 human beings. I used to think that was something special. But in 2014 the dream turned into a nightmare. The price of oil collapsed. That made new plastic much cheaper because it's made from oil. Suddenly, Chris Dow's recycled plastic looked expensive. You can imagine that our margin was absolutely crushed. So we approached our customers and explained, you know, the situation. And we looked to get some price support through that difficult time. So you asked your customers to pay more. Please, will you pay more for this recycled plastic? How did they respond? At the start, they were all with us. And we actually got through for a few months. And we thought it was a blip. But of course, it was a far greater blip than we had anticipated. The oil price remained low for a long time. Yes, remained low and the bottle price remained high. So we approached, you know, all of the, all of the dairies and seeking support. Two of the bigger dairies agreed. One refused, and that just everything fell over like a house of card because it was sort of all in or none in. The business failed. Chris Dowell and his family moved back to Australia. Today, the factories back up and running. After several other people tried and failed to make it work, the French giant Viola has taken it over. This is the wet side of the process or the dirty side, if you like, where the dirty milk bottles come in, we've shredded them down, and now we've got these spin dryers. Theolia's chief technology officer, Richard Kirkman, shows me how the system works. So we start to get just little small pieces of flake, which I'll show you in the next room. Watch out, it's a little bit slippery here. It's a bit like, sort of like, confetti. That's exactly what it's like. How much would that be worth? Maybe a ton of it will be £1,200.200. It takes a lot of effort to get there, so we need to recoup that to cover the cost of making it. But like Kristall, Violia is finding it hard to squeeze a profit out of all those old milk bottles. We really need a bigger economy of scale than this to make it profitable because we're competing with the big oil companies that are producing virgin plastic and they produce millions of tons of it. At rock bottom prices, very important. to make it profitable because we're competing with the big oil companies that are producing virgin plastic and they produce millions of tons of it. At rock bottom prices, very appealing to brands and retailers, no wonder they're still choosing cheap new plastic over expensive recycled plastic. It's very challenging at the moment to get enough end sales on the final product we produce because we need to get people to commit to one or two years of supply so we can invest in equipment to reprocess and then provide them that material so it's something that's happening now as we speak you know this plant is here to try and make a profit to sell the material to the brand to get more material and so we can get the price down for them again so they find it more profitable to buy this material. How much bigger would you have to be? If we do 10,000 tonnes we can make it and we're doing probably 6,000 or 7,000 tons at the moment. We're still trying to get enough of the producers of new bottles to start putting 30% recycled in those bottles. Today some bottles have that in, most don't. So you need retailers to make that choice to put more recycled materials, in those bottles. Today, some bottles have that in, most don't. So you need retailers to make that choice to put more recycled material in their bottles? If there was a decision made to put higher levels of recycled content in new bottles, then this whole system would feed itself, because we would go out and we'd collect more of it and we'd build another plant and we'd supply them. Disposing of packaging costs taxpayers billions of pounds a year, whether in collection and recycling or landfill costs. The government tries to recoup some of that money from retailers and manufacturers, but local councils say they're left to foot 90% of the bill. 40 companies recently pledged to make more of their packaging recyclable and to use more recycled plastic and less virgin plastic. Jacob Hela, executive director of the Environmental Services Association, says it's a start, but it's not enough. I think it's a great initiative. Those are absolutely the right ambitions, the right objectives to have. That's absolutely what the industry needs. But it is only voluntary. We have experience in this country of voluntary schemes not necessarily working at critical times. So, for example, when the oil price fell a few years back, that led to recycling businesses being put under pressure. Recycling businesses failing as a result of the voluntary measures not being adhered to during those difficult times. Businesses like Chris Down's closed loop? Absolutely. I think we would like to see specific targets for recycled content, certainly within plastics, packaging and goods, etc. And we would like to see penalties, you know, it's a stick and carrot approach. We would like to see penalties for those which aren't able to meet those targets for recycle content. In other words, government intervention. So how worried are companies about that prospect? Not very. At a recent conference in Birmingham, there was a lot of talk about making packaging recyclable, not so much about using recycled plastic. I brought the topic up with Ian Schofield, the tough-talking man in charge of packaging at the supermarket chain, Iceland, a company that hasn't signed up to the latest voluntary targets, although it does have its own plan to cut waste. We've had a big rethink where we declared that in the next five years we're going to remove all our plastics from our own naval packaging, which is 1,400 products. So it's a massive task, a huge task for me and the business. You're still talking about using new material in your packaging, aren't you? Virgin product. What about using recycled material? Wouldn't that complete the circle if you were using recycled product in your packaging, which could then be recycled? Wouldn't that be the perfect circle? Well we are doing that now anyway. There is an element of that, but it's only a small amount. But if the government put a legal requirement on you to put a certain percentage, say 30% or 50% of recycled material in your packaging, you'd fight that, you wouldn't want that? Not fight it, we'd have to look at it, but if it gave us less shelf life, if it gave us issues with contamination, if it wasn't fit for purpose, you know, then there's a lot of things that go into packaging to make this thing right. So it's complex, but it's not overburdening. We should be able to cope with this, but the government doing it, I'm against that. Is cost a factor too? Cost is always a factor. Retail is a brilliant at it. We operate on very low margins. So when you operate on low margins, every little penny counts. So anything that's going to increase the cost to the consumer or cost to us, we're going to look at. Cost is vital. However, there are some brands that think there's money to be made in using recycled plastic about an hour's journey from the belgian city of antwerp ecuver bottles its cleaning products and in a corner of the factory, dreams up new ideas. So this is where all the people in the white coats are behind the scenes doing the science. Yeah, I think this is the heart of our business really. This is where the new formulations, the new ingredients are being made and constantly looking for new innovations to make our products better or more ecological. And innovations manager Tom Doeman tells me that as well as new detergent formulas, the company's technicians have been working on the bottle. The bottle is also really a big part of the environmental impact of our products. This is our latest bottle that was made out of 100% recycled content. It's got a greyish tinge to it. It does look a bit different. Just comparing it to this water bottle next to it, which isn't a normal non-recycled plastic water bottle. Yeah, so indeed, you see, especially if you just have them next to each other, you'll definitely see a kind of difference in colour. Tom Doeman's honest about one of the big concerns for retailers. Recycled plastic isn't just more expensive. It makes their products look less appealing, less sellable. Ekova was able to take the risk because being environmentally friendly is its unique selling point. We are, of course, a premium product in the market, which is mainly linked also to the choice of ingredients we make. But even we, of course, there's a limit to premium. People are willing to pay a bit more. How much more will they pay? I think that's like 10% is acceptable for most people. Once you go above the 10%, you lose a lot of consumers. So, yeah, that's definitely the challenge. So even the discerning customer won't pay much more than 20p extra for washing up liquid packaged in 100% recycle plastic. Tom Doeman thinks it doesn't have to be like this. He says that if more retailers followed suit, the recycling industry would rise to the occasion and the issues would iron themselves out. A view shared by Richard Kirkman at the milk bottle recycling plant that needs more customers. I don't think people are satisfied with the level of recycling we're doing. So we can't rely on exporting that material, so we need to find a solution here. It's a decision to make. So we've reached the tipping point where we now need to look at new ways to make things, putting recycled content back into those virgin products, and adapting the industry again. We calculated that it's worth about 29 billion pounds of the economy over the next 10 years to do that. So it's definitely worth it because it creates innovation, it creates jobs, and it makes sustainable business. So it seems to be worth doing. However, he says it won't work unless everyone involved has a considerable shift of mindset, including me and you. I think there's the consumers who need to make decisions about what they buy. The manufacturers will respond to that, and we will also respond by investing. There's three people at the party and we all need to do something to make a change. So what happens to my recycling and yours? Where it goes, how much money is made and by whom depends in part on the choices we make. I hope you enjoyed that programme, especially as it was me Tony Bonsignore that produced it. You can download lots of other BBC business programmes from the World of Business podcast webpage."}
