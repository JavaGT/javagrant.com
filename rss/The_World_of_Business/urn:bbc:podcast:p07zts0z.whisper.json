This podcast is supported by advertising outside the UK. Hi and welcome to the world of business from the BBC. When I got to Zimbabwe, I couldn't believe how much everyone loved a dish called Sazza. It's a thick and creamy dish made from corn or maize. But what also surprised me was how few people realised that maize isn't actually indigenous to Zimbabwe and it doesn't grow well in very dry climates. So everyone's favourite dish is under threat from climate change. But it's so hard to stop eating your favourite food. I know I couldn't give up bread. I'm the producer Phoebe Keene, but here's Charlotte Ashton, the presenter, to take up the story. On her small farm in Zimbabwe, Mrs Malambo is cooking lunch. We first boil our water. When our water is boiling, we take our cup of maize and then we put it in the water. My Malambo is in her 60s, bent over a big black pot, stirring a thick, bubbling white mixture. Our translator, Khadzai, talks us through the recipe. And then we mix it with a, we call it a Bogoti, cooking stick into a thick paste. We do not want any lumps in our maize mill. And then we let it simmer until it's all done. This looks like really hard work. It's boiling hot and pieces of ash from the fire keeps spitting into our eyes. Ah, quite a snitis. My Malambo is used to the heat because this dish, SADSA, is what she's cooked every day since she was a girl. And lunch is ready. My Malambo, Mrs Malambo has spooned some big dollops of Sazza onto a plate, which is sort of thickening and setting. So can we dig in? Am I ta-basa? As we sit to eat in a round room with a high-thatched roof, my Malambo tells me Sazza isn't just her favourite dish. It's eaten everywhere in Zimbabwe, and she means everywhere. 250 kilometres north at a restaurant in the capital city of Harare, middle-class business people are tucking into lunch, and the dish on nearly every plate is... Today I had sada, white sazaes, sausage and green veggies. This is what we grew up eating. I love satsa. It's like Mama's kitchen. Yeah. White Sazza, yeah. I eat it every day. If you don't eat Sazza, you feel there's something missing. Someone said to me that Zimbabwe has a love affair with White Sazza. Do you think? Generally, yes. Jhāakangad in Koshchapira Seiko. Ah, Ojee, Oya, Oya, Jaka, Koshchchapira Seik. These Zimbabweens are the lordschapidazza is simply unaffordable. A devastating economic crisis has seen the Zimbabwean dollar tumble in value. Prices have soared, salaries haven't. Even teachers and doctors are struggling to afford enough food. Despite warnings, the government failed to store enough grain. Seven million people are relying on food aid. In the words of a UN special rapporteur, the result is man-made starvation. But this program is about the role nature is playing, because scientists say that climate change means hotter, drier weather will be the new norm here, making life even harder for Zimbabwe's farmers. Because it's hard work. It's not easy work. It's hard work here. You need to be strong to work in the land. That's our life. This is Dr. Paul Machinaripe. He's a local leader in the Gutsu district of southern Zimbabwe. He's 72 but still runs a management consultancy firm in Harari, traveling back down here on the weekends to his family and his fields. I am tired. Let's just go and sit down. I've come to visit Dr. Machinaripe because he has an important story to tell. It's a story, an innovation which came out of misery, out of problems. It started in 2005 when conditions were... Terrible, terrible, terrible. There was not even a single drop of rain during that year. So it was even worse than this year just gone? It was much worse than this just past year. There was not even a single drop. People were looking miserable, thin, angry, hungry. It was a hopeless situation. I got all the elders together and said, let's discuss this problem. What is happening? And one elder stood up and said, look, I think we are to blame because we started coping the European, the white man's way of life and started growing maize, which is a white man's crop, and ignored our own traditional crop. The crop given us by nature, which is finger millet. Finger millet is one of the so-called small grains that were the staple food across southern Africa before maize took over in the 19th and early 20th centuries, driven by European colonial governments as a cash crop. It's a grass which can die when there's no moisture, there's no rain, and then when rain comes back, it comes back to life. It's almost resurrects. It resurrects, that's very true. Unlike your maze. When maize is gone, it's right off and it doesn't come back to life. So Millet grows better in dry conditions. And Dr. Machinaripe discovered it's healthier too. So I took fingernail to a laboratory in Ararid. I discovered it is very high in fiber, very rich in calcium. It had proteins. So it was the best food designed for us. Convinced his people need never go hungry, Dr. Machinaripe took to the road to persuade farmers to plant millet. Were people reluctant to switch back? They were. They were not very sure. But you know, we said, okay, let's give it a try. Then they waited and waited for the rain. And rain didn't come. The only crop which survived that season was finger-needed. And how did the communities react to that? I think they started believing us. But, you know, minds and attitudes change after quite some time. Dr. Machinaripe has spent the last 14 years traveling across the region, educating farmers about small grains, reviving lost knowledge. It's an informal operation, so we don't know how many farmers he has converted, but Dr. Machinaripe estimates it's in the tens of thousands. There was a lot of travelling. And who's paid for all of this? Have you had support from donors or charities? There's no donor. I paid it from my own pocket. Really? I've done it out of passion. And really out of the belief that that is the only crop that can save these people here. There's a lot of Western donors spending a lot of money on small holder resilience, as they call it. Could you have had some money from them? I've discouraged people to have this what they call donor syndrome. Everything, donor, don't. The moment people believe in getting things for free, they will don't, don't believe, or they are not motivated to work harder for themselves. Whatever you eat, whatever you get, you should earn it. It should come from you, not given by someone for free. I don't believe in that. Can we go and see some of those farmers? Yes, we can go and see some of the farmers. Great. Let's go. Let's go. This is what I was doing. Every day on the road, I've really covered many many kilometers thousands of kilometers the short journey across the village took longer than I'd expected people keep flagging down the car to stop and say hello she's one of our farmers very good finger fingernailet farmer. Okay. And another stop. This time for a woman herding her cows along the lane. It's clear Dr. Machinaripe is something of a local celeb. They are all farmers that we have worked with. We make it eventually to the home of Mai Malambo, who we had lunch with at the start of the program. She's one of the first farmers Dr. Machinaripe worked with. So these are your chickens? Yes. I can hear and some cats. You've got lots of cats here. My Malambo now plants most of her fields with millet and only a little maze. So Maimbal, this harvest, this year, how have you done? How have things been? Have you managed to harvest? Yes, I harvested. For millet this year, we managed to get a good harvest. This year it's so rare to hear as Mbawian farmers say they've had a good harvest that I wanted to see inside the grain store for myself. But when we looked inside, there was nothing. Just a brick wall. So how do you get it? How do you get it out? Oh, when we want to get it, we'll remove the bricks and then take it. So why have you done that for security? Because of the fees. Because there are people that go around stealing people's grains. Okay, so this really illustrates the value of food around here. Mrs Malumba has literally built a wall, a concrete wall with a hole in it, put her millet store inside and then bricked up the hole so that nobody can touch it. And I guess you'll then take the bricks out to access the millet when you need some more. Is that right? Yes, it is. Yeah, okay, right, wow. Gosh, that's better than any padlock, isn't it? He literally have to break the wall down to get into it. My Malambo's millet can stay bricked up in there for years. Some say 30 years, and it will still be good to eat. To keep maize anywhere near that long takes expensive chemicals or bags. But the smaller, harder millet grains, they're about the size of cusus, are more difficult to handle and to grow, as Dr. Machinareepi explains. When it comes to wooding, working on the land, it's easier with maize, because you can use a cultivator, you can use a plow, and so on. But it's not easy with finger millet. But it is a better evil than having no food at all. Millet isn't a wonder crop. It's hard work. There are none of the mechanical shellers and milling machines that exist across Zimbabwe for maize. But farmers here are so grateful to have food, they've written a song of thanks for Dr. Machinaripe. Right now we are happy. Because of the small grains that we are farming. There's not many farmers in Zimbabwe saying that they're happy this year. You must feel quite grateful to Dr. Mnishinawipi. Is he a local hero? Yes, he's our angel. He's your angel? Yeah. As Zimbabwe's success with Millet begs an urgent question. Dr. Machinaripi's success success with millet begs an urgent question. Could it be replicated across the country? Could every smallholder farmer grow small grains to increase food security? To find out, I visited Anna Brazier, a sustainable development consultant who works for international donors and charities on programs to help smallholder farmers. It's a bit like a jungle in here. It's lovely though, isn't it? Gosh, look at these trees. Yeah. It's lush. Oh, like a piece of chicken. Yes, we've got chickens and ducks and our swimming pools full of fish. Anna may sound British, but she's lived in Zimbabwe since 1982, longer than she lived in England. Still haven't managed to ditch the accent, though. Anna, how big is this challenge of switching farmers from predominantly growing maize to growing more small grains and drought-resistant crops? It's extremely difficult, Charlotte, because you're reversing more than a century of policy that has been directed at maize and promoting maize. There was a huge push on the part of missionaries and the colonial government to make people feel that their traditional crops were in some way uncivilized and primitive. Then after independence, the government decided to persist with the same policies because maize has always been seen as an important cash crop and an important commodity. Just to get a sense of the scale of the challenge, how many farmers here in Zimbabwe are growing maize? Practically every farmer in Zimbabwe is growing maize. So how is the government practically, physically promoting incumptu? growing maize? Practically every farmer in Zimbabwe is growing maize. So how is the government practically, physically promoting, encouraging farmers, pushing farmers towards maize? Well, in the past, the government have helped farmers with fertilizers, seed, pesticides, and all of those have been given to farmers to encourage them to grow certain crops. And this is a huge incentive for farmers. Another incentive is the Grain Marketing Board. It's a government-owned body which tightly controls the buying and selling of grains. It guarantees smallholders a price, which for Mays has often been higher than the open market price in neighbouring countries. Small grains haven't been pushed to the same degree. So farmers are absolutely held hostage to the grain marketing board. It doesn't make any sense for them to grow small grains because they have no guarantee of a buyer. And that's why maize is ubiquitous now. So it makes business sense, but it's caused a food security crisis. A food security crisis and a crisis of another nature too, this time public health. I mean, maize is quite famous among nutritionists as containing lower levels of important amino acids, lower levels of vitamins A, B and C, lower amounts of iron. One of the big problems that Zimbabwe has struggled with is stunting. Areas where mazes predominant have the highest stunting levels in the country. So in terms of addressing Zimbabwe's current food crisis, small grains could not only address the supply issue, but also the nutrition problem. Absolutely. Zimbabwe is very lucky in that we have an excellent army of extension officers who are trained in agriculture, employed by government, working at community level. And their job is basically to disseminate information to farmers and to support farmers with advice. But having said that, while they have been disseminating this information, they have been trying to encourage people to grow small grains in areas that are suited to small grains. People will not grow small grains until there's a shift in the market because they don't see the point in doing it. A walk around one of Harare's biggest food markets shows you how little business incentive there is for farmers to switch to sorghum or millet. We're just making our way across to the food section. Some little red tomatoes, some bright neon yellow mangoes. So here's the sorghum. Hits and a small pot here of millet. There's a lady running a stall and looking after her baby at the same time. Business is quite slow. There's only one stall selling two small buckets of small grains. And here at the back of the market is the maze behind a big fence and a guy who's padlocked the gate shut. It shows how highly valued the maze is. The maze is behind a big fence and a padlock gate and the millet and the sorghum is just in buckets at the size by one of the stalls. People don't care about it so much. Shifting the taste of a nation away from such a beloved staple food is a monumental challenge. But one that another business in Zimbabwe is tackling head-on. You can't just tell people, oh, there will be a market at the end of the season, go ahead and grow it. So you have to show them that this market is there, that it's reliable, that they can grow for it. And that's what I wanted to do with Mighty Mail. Jen Mayer runs a food company in Harari. They want to increase the popularity of small grains, this time sorghum, with a new instant porridge. And what's your journey, Jen? Where are you from and how did you come to be setting up a food company in Zimbabwe? I'm obviously from America. I can't miss that. I started out working for an international NGO here in Zimbabwe back nine years ago. And I was doing a lot of work around economic development and agriculture. And I just was starting to get a little discouraged, I guess, or frustrated. I wanted to try to do some of these things that people talk about almost theoretically and try to see if you could do it for real, through a company that has bricks and mortar results and provides jobs. That's when they came up with the porridge, Mighty Meal. So Mighty Meal is made out of sorghum, nemo beans, ground nuts and baobab. And the idea is that it's a mass market product, right? It also is a high quality nutritious, instant porridge. Because it's a mass market product, it will help to provide a more reliable market for its component ingredients that grow best for smallholder farmers. The Mighty Meal packaging is bold. The M has two mussely arms and it says in big letters, 100% Zimbabwean, 100% nutritious. It's clear they're targeting the health conscious consumer. That it appeals even as like a performance food, it appeals as like a health food for really anyone who seeks to live a healthier lifestyle really. We've heard from Zimbabweans all over the country about their love affair with Mays. You only have to go into the supermarket or a market to see how it's absolutely the dominant product here. What's your marketing strategy for sort of breaking through that with a product that, you know, ah, isn't maize? Yeah, it's not going to be an easy, it hasn't been, and it won't be necessarily an easy hill to climb. But we also recognize that part of marketing is also just straight-up consumer awareness. So there'll be road shows where we'll be going into neighborhoods and driving around and getting people excited about it, handing out loads and loads of free samples, but also having the team there making the porridge for people to try on the spot. So it's a real hearts and minds mission then. Absolutely. In a warehouse behind the offices is the factory where Mighty meal is produced. The workers all look like they've stepped out of a snowstorm. They've looked a thin layer of white flower in their hair and on their eyelashes. And there's a rather pretty trail of footprints going through the dust that's on the floor. The factory owners are staking their future on a market shift towards small grain. footprints going through the dust that's on the floor. The factory owners are staking their future on a market shift towards small grains. They're plowing capital investment into new machinery to process traditional ingredients into convenience products like the instant porridge. Wayne Moss is the CEO and he showed me around. So obviously the first part of the process, we come to the grain cleaner. So we go into our grain cleaner. The Nemo beans need to go for roasting. The ground nuts also goes into the roaster. So the roaster in particular, you couldn't find one. So that was one of the pieces where we had to actually design and work with engineers to actually create a roaster that could be used as part of this process. What we needed did not exist in Zim and we had to sort of design it from scratch. And forgive my simplicity here, but the way that I described this is like one of those toasts you get in a hotel where you put the bread in one end and it slides slowly through and comes out the other end roasted. Exactly. There we go, here they are. Oh, it's hot. I have to say, it smells absolutely gorgeous. That sort of nutty, roasted, smoky smell is lovely, isn't it? The Mighty Meal team is hoping to change Zimbabwe's breakfast tastes. But what about the ubiquitous white maize Sazza, the basis of lunch and dinner? We crossed Harari to Gava's, a trendy restaurant where small grain satsa is high up on the menu. We wanted to promote authentic traditional Zimbabwean meals cooked in the traditional way and new interesting ways as well to cater for the new generation. Alan Gava is the restaurant owner. The waitress just, thank you, just arrived with some warm, soapy water. Please, wash your hands before you start eating. As we eat sadsar, of course, with our hands. Yes, with your hands. Alan served me a selection of satsas, each one made from different grains. Yes, just on time. Thank you. Well, thank you. And then a plate of satsa has arrived, all different colours. So what have we got here, Alan? This one's a dark red. So that's the rio, which is finger millet. Then that is the sorghum. So sorghum is a sort of mustard colour, sazza. In a perfect, neat, smooth ball. And that's the pearl millet. That's the pearl millet again. That's a sort of pale purple almost really, isn't it? Kakish-grish. I can give it all colours. Yeah, and then in the middle is the absolutely gleaming white maize satsa. Okay, well let's dig in. I'm going to start with the pearl millet, the munga satsa. Yes, yeah. Mmm. It's so good, it's really smooth though, it's not grainy or... But it's almost got a bitterness to it, hasn't it? It's nice, it's earthy. I mean, the white saza, for me, it's no flavour and it's almost got a bitterness to it hasn't it? Yes. It's nice, it's earthy. I mean the white satsar for me it's no flavour and it's just you know you have to eat huge quantities to fill up. So how's the business doing? How is the restaurant doing? The restaurant is doing well and what do I mean by that? You can order white satsar, millet, sorghum at the same price. So that we want to give a chance of somebody who really wants to be healthy, somebody who knows the benefits to be able to get that and not spend extra money into it. We are even going to that extent of subsidising for people to be able to enjoy that. So you're subsidising the small grain satsas, Alan. Does that mean you're actually losing money on this? At first we're losing more money, but there's more farmers and the prices come down. So we're not losing as much as before. So you've taken a hit as a business? Yes, for sure. For sure, there's a hit there. How sustainable is it to continue subsidising small grains in that way? It's hard, but we are hoping with this new thing where they're encouraging, especially this season, of more small grain, it's going to flood and then the prices will come down. So we may take a hit now, but we are hopeful that this is going to increase, because the supply will increase. The supply increase. So definitely it's going to flood and we'll level up. Okay, so you're hoping that the supply of small grains will increase, the price will come down, and you won't have to subsidise these traditional foods in the way you want to. For sure. Perhaps that first-mover advantage will make Alan Rich. But as we chatted over lunch, it became clear he isn't in the restaurant business just for the money. So my dad died from diabetes and my mother died from breast cancer. And I was lucky to be close to them and take care of them and go and visit the doctors with them and so I could hear what the doctors were saying about the diets they need to take you know and all they talked about was basically going back to our traditional food and being first-hand taking care of my parents made me really see the importance of it. Like Dr. Machinariah Parma, Gerida Pandima, Alan Garva is a businessman for whom small grains are about more than profit. They are all taking a business hit in the effort to shift Zimbabwean tastes. That won't happen overnight, but it could help Zimbabwe survive climate change, drought, malnutrition, harnessing the crops of old to face the challenges of the future. The world of business was presented by Charlotte Ashton and produced by me, Phoebe Keene. It was mixed by Neil Churchill. Thanks to Kudzai Faro and Faro Sammy, who ensured our trip to Zimbabwe, went smoothly. And thanks also to our production coordinators, Sabine Shrek and Maria Ogundale. The editor was Penny Murphy."}
