This podcast is supported by advertising outside the UK. This is the BBC's world of business. I'm Manuela Saragossa, and the producer is Rosamund Jones. In this week's download edition of Global Business from the BBC World Service, we're in Naples in southern Italy. And we're asking if this city, bedeviled with extraordinarily high youth unemployment and extremely low levels of investment can reinvent its economy through tech. It's not every day you start a program about tech businesses in an 18th century Baroque church. But bear with me. I'm in San Severo Chapel in the centre of Naples in southern Italy. And the reason I'm here is to see what is perhaps the city's most famous piece of art. It's a sculpture of Jesus after his crucifixion, lying on his back, covered in a thin shroud. And the extraordinary thing is the shroud appears transparent. You can make out the tiniest details in Christ's feet and hands through it, even his facial expression. Yet the whole statue is carved from one single block of marble. It's viewed as an artistic miracle. And what I want to know is if Naples can do's a city with a ungovernable and chaotic. Its economy, like that of the rest of southern Italy, lags massively behind the rest of the country. The north-south divide here is a chasm. And half of the city's young are out of work. We have a lot of young people that try to have their opportunity abroad. So they just leave? Yes, they just want to leave and to be in Milan or to be in London is the same thing. You are not in your home. But in the few days I've been here, people have been telling me a business tech ecosystem is emerging, and it just might change Naples' fortunes. In this program, I'm asking, can Naples pull it off? My first stop is the courtyard of the University of Naples Fidelico Secondo Engineering School, because this is where the global giant Apple opened its only academy in Europe just two years ago. Not Berlin, not London, not Dublin, not any of the obvious European tech hubs. Instead, it chose what many would describe as a tech backwater to build a centre dedicated to training new generations of app developers. The Academy is housed in a shiny new building, all metal and glass, and very different to what used to be there, a tomato canning factory, as Professor Giorgio Ventre, the scientific director of the Apple Academy, told me. The tomato canning factory was mainly employing female workers. And so this place was a place where family usually had two incomes. So for a working class area was quite a rich area. And suddenly everything disappeared. So this is the reason why, I mean, you are looking at a place where many buildings have very bad shape. It's not the most scenic part of Naples. Put it that way. Believe me. You're right. You're right. So we are doing our best effort to try to help the neighbour to start again. So in total, how many have you had graduate from the Academy so far? We have been graduating 600 students. And most of them, are they mainly from this region of Italy? Yes, it's around 70%. The major goal, both of Federico Secondo and Apple was to have a big impact on Campania region, actually. Which floor are you on here? We are on the third floor, with a nice view on the Vesuvius. It's a volcano. Yeah, that's right. Should we go inside and see the Academy? Sure, absolutely. The Academy is a series of bright, big open spaces with plenty of comfy sofas and chairs and large windows, some with panoramic views and others overlooking the city's maze of dark, narrow streets. All these students sitting there around tables, they're not in class, they're obviously just... This is the class. This project has been proposed to buy Apple and we like it very much. Learning is just by doing. I mean, to me it looks like they are in a workplace. Is that the point? Yeah, it is, it is. And all the teaching is in English. And that's because English is the kind of international language of technology, isn't it? Oh, of course, of course. Apple pays for all student fees and living costs. It doesn't employ teachers, but mentors who advise students on all the elements, coding, marketing and design, involved in app development. Fabrizio Ferrarra was sitting with eight others working on an app for people with dyslexia. I'm dyslexic. For you, it's been a really personal thing as well, isn't it? Yes, yes, yes. The app is called Aylesia. So you've opened the app and you're going to take a picture of some text. Yes, you can select the font. So you're choosing a font that's easier for dyslexic people to read? We make some research for select the better font for this lessic person. And with this font, we give a possibility to disliked people to read more fast. And we uploaded three weeks ago to the Apple App Store. Yeah, yeah. For now it's free. But we are thinking about to make it with a payment. Good luck. Thank you. Thank you. If you're wondering what's in it for Apple, well, it gets some revenue from the apps it sells in its iOS app store. The more apps it sells, the more it makes. But more importantly, in Naples, Apple can make a big splash. The city has no history of app development, as is the case in the only other two countries where Apple has set up academies, Indonesia and Brazil. And where Apple goes, others academies, Indonesia and Brazil. And where Apple goes, others follow. Deloitte Digital arrived in Naples in 2017. And Cisco has now also opened an academy here. All of which means Naples can begin to call itself a fledgling tech hub, according to a group of Apple Academy graduates I met. How many of you are doing startups now? So two of you. So I'll start with you. Do you want to introduce yourself first of all? My name is Fabio Nishi, and we have this game for kids. It's available in the Apple App Store. Yeah, sure. I am Roberto Frena, and I'm 21. And I'm currently studying computer science here in Naples and also working part-time with Carl. Yeah, I'm Carlo Baruffini and I work with Robert as developer, software developer and we work to develop iOS and also Android application. Traitor. Job prospects for these graduates are good. My name is Antonio Chiapetta, and I graduated last year. And right after the end of the academy, we had a fair here where a lot of companies came to see our works, and 10 of them proposed me a job. You have a choice that perhaps, I don't know, kids your age who graduated five, six years ago may not have had? Yeah, in our case, we have the possibility to choose, and it's the most important things. Yeah, exactly, and the Academy really gave us the opportunity to actually have a choice in what we want to do. It could also change the reputation of Naples and this region of Campania. The Apple Academy and all these environment that is growing fast in Naples is helping to change the idea that people have of this area of the south of Italy from outside. We are not what they believe we are. I get that. My father's side of the family is from central Italy. Growing up, Naples was synonymous with organised crime, crumbling infrastructure, crazy devil-may-care driving, and Shippatori, the dreaded bagsnatcher. Mostly the south is linked with dishonesty and mafia, stuff like that. Do you think there is a bit of prejudice from the north? When they look down south here, do you think that there is a bit of prejudice? Yes, there is a bit of prejudice from the north? When they look down south here, do you think that there is a bit of prejudice? Yes, there is a bit of prejudice. I definitely think so. So you're trying to change that image. Yes, exactly. Also, a question of honor. Pride. Pride, exactly. Even public officials appear galvanised by Apple's arrival. Valeria Fashone is Campania's Minister of Internationalisation, Start-Ups and Innovation, the only region in Italy to employ someone with that title. I caught up with her in a sunny courtyard on her lunchtime break. When people say with some sceptical attitude,, why Naples, why we have to invest in Naples? And I say simply if Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple thinks that this is an amazing place, I should agree with him. For decades, the best graduates in this part of the country could hope for was a job in the public sector. I can vouch for that. Most of my Italian family have gone into government positions. They're highly prized for their job security and generous pensions. Massive cutbacks in public spending have changed that. There is a cultural shift because till some years ago, everybody wants to have a public employment. But we have this very fantastic phenomenon that there is a number of startups that is growing and Naples in particular is the four big cities in terms of a number of startups and we are also the second region for the young start-appers what age group is that 18 to 32 and so it is an opportunity for some territory that were a little bit left behind. Left behind to have a new chance, yes. Growing fast, maybe, but let's not forget that it's from a very low base. And some of that start-up activity may well be down to desperation. The only way to get a job is to create your own. Still, I was struck by how many of the tech entrepreneurs I spoke to were really committed to their city. What's good about being based here as a tech startup? It's quite hard question because it's a romantic question. It's a very simple. It's the most beautiful place in the world, no more. One of our main efforts is provide people the possibility to stay. At the beginning, I told yes, I want to make money. But then I came to realize I want to really have a good life, family, friends home. It's a cliche, but it's true. I want to really have a good life, family, friends, home. It's a cliche, but it's true. I want to stay here. I want my son to grow here. And I want to help this place. One of those who wants to stay put is a new startup, based in a co-working space in a modern block in central Naples. Gooda, Sierra! I've just come into the offices of Evia and I'm here with Paolo Yasevoi, who's one of the co-founders of the company. How long have you been around? This summer is going to be three years, so we are still a startup, but we are growing fast. And who came up with the idea? How did it work? It came up from a few friends. They decided to do a system based on Internet of Things. So Internet of Things is basically the technology that thanks to sensors allowed people to talk with the environment. So we just decided, okay, let's apply this technology to agriculture, because agriculture in Italy is a huge business, but there is still quite a gap in terms of technology. What Evia does is install sensors in fields and greenhouses. The sensors gather data on growing conditions, soil quality, humidity and temperature, for example. That data then allows farmers to make better and quicker decisions on how to improve their yields. We are mainly working with medium-large farms. Mainly in Italy. Italy, but we already also had sales in Macedonia, and we are closing deals in Spain and South America. Next step will be Central European markets. Paolo and his company could have left but didn't. We had the opportunity to move abroad. We had an offer from the city of Madrid and from the city of Barcelona. We have the opportunity, of course, to move to Vienna and Munich because our shareholders are based there. We are still holding strong and staying in Naples for two reasons. One is that we want to prove that it's possible to do business here. Second is that the target market that we are addressing at the moment is very much concentrated in this area. But it's hard. We had major issues accessing credit with the bank. We had major issues getting fundings from the government. Things are slower. So why stay? What's the upside? Paying a professional here in Naples is going to be cheaper than paying a professional in London. How much cheaper? Up to half the salary, but cost of life is way cheaper here. So from the employee point of view is also an advantage. The low salaries must also work in your favour. It means your costs as a business are also much lower. Yes, definitely it is an advantage. But does it also make you more profitable because your sales are international, but your cost-based, your salaries stay low? Yes. So a small company with big ambitions. It's not the only one. I'm coming off a really busy street in central Naples. I'm walking into a courtyard here to go to see the offices of Bazoult. It employs 70 people globally, 40 of them work here, and it hopes to have 100 employees by the end of this year. Bazul was set up just over four years ago. It's an influencer marketing company. In plain English, that means it helps firms analyze their online presence and gets people with millions of followers on social media to promote their goods. Fabrizio Perone is the CEO and co-founder. He gave me a tour of the company's new premises, pointing to a picture of a unicorn he placed on the door of his office. That's basically the room where myself and Gennaro, my co-founder and CEO, sit. A billion-dollar company is called a unicorn in the startup industry. Yeah. It's kind of aspirational this room. You're not worth a billion. No, no. Not yet, but of course, we'll be soon. Fabrizio, like Paolo at Evia, says that skilled tech staff are cheap in Naples. We have a really good technology hub here in Naples in terms of young developer. On the other hand, when we need to hire more senior people, we need to look more at people that were working in other cities. So lots of people that is from Naples that wants to come back. That's our primary target. So Bazul is doing its bit to reverse the city's brain drain. I'm Daniel Zamfardino and I am Carlo di Dominico. And Daniel and Carlo you both came back from overseas both of you to work back in Naples. But tell me your story Danieli. So I went to Brighton three years ago. In the UK. In the UK and I started working as a web developer after a few months and I decided to come back here last September to work for Bazou in Naples. And if you hadn't received the offer from Bazou, would you have come back to Naples? I don't think so because I probably would have stayed there. And Carlo? So I was instead in Germany in Munich for almost four years. Home sickness was already inside me. I got called from Bazou. You got head hunted. Head hunted. Yes, exactly. So I feel lucky about having found a job that was really interesting. Bazul may be tempting back those who've left, but it also has global ambitions. You need to have salespeople and probably also marketing people that are closer to the market. So we really want to keep our technology hub in Naples, but our plan is to expand in the US and then in China. So of course we need to increase the power of international hub as we are already doing, moving some central department in London as well and then in New York, maybe thinking like to go public, why not? Why not indeed? But it means a lot of the company's growth in job creation could happen outside of Naples and outside of Italy. And that's what makes the new economy so different from the old here. It's footloose. On a sunny spring day on the outskirts of Naples, a group of schoolchildren are visiting the city of science, the Cittad deliscients. It's a huge site with an interactive science museum and also, crucially, a startup incubator called Campania New Steel, a hatchery for new businesses, if you like. All of it built on the grounds of a former industrial zone. The site's manager Anne-Marie Briaas took me up onto the roof. We've come up here. There is an absolutely stunning view here of part of the Bay of Naples. We've got the island of Iskia in the distance. Looking behind us away from the bay, we've got the old structure of the steel factory there behind us as well. Yes. We are here in the western part of Naples, which is a former industrial area. You can still see the old structures of the steel factory there. Yeah, exactly. In the past, more than 15,000 people worked here. The startup incubator here was set up in 2003, the new economy visibly replacing the old. But how many jobs has it created? We can estimate that we have created more than 150 start-ups and more than 85% of these startups are now on the market. So that's the survival rate, 85% after three years? Yes. How many jobs has that created? We can say more than 1,000 new jobs for people. So most of the companies created here have stayed small and one reason for that is the lack of funding. I am Giovanni Decado. I've been working in the private tech with a venture capital industry since almost 20 years. And I am let's say the financial man of the incubator. I try to help startups raising funds. It's a tough job. Campania is a region that's received some of the lowest investment in the whole of Western Europe. Most of Italy's economic activity happens up north. The network of private investors in Milan is huge, much, much bigger than one that we have here. And there is a network of institution that help the environment grow. We are building it here. So one of the things that we are trying to do is to bring those investors from Milan here in Napoli to invest, but it's more difficult, of course. What stops them? Maybe geographical issues, maybe cultural issues because southern Italy is quite different from Northern Italy. If you've ever been in Milan, things work in a quite different way. The companies are here. The money is not. Some would go much further than that. They'd say things just don't work down south. The roads are bad. Trains are slow. Public investment doesn't deliver the services it's supposed to. Little wonder, private capital chooses to stay away. But then there isn't much of a pool of venture capital funds in Italy anyway. Size-wise, it's about a tenth of that in London. What Italians do have, though, is a very large and wealthy diaspora. A venture capital company in London called iStarter is tapping into it. Its president is Nicola Garelli. I asked him, who's putting money into the fund? Right now, we are still expanding the network in other countries, like, for example, in the US, and we are also setting up our office in China. Focusing on Italians in those countries, in those places that you're setting up in. Yes, absolutely, absolutely. And the reason for that was that we developed a strong sense of give back towards countries in those places that you're setting up in? Yes, absolutely, absolutely. And the reason for that was that we developed a strong sense of give back towards the country. Many of us spent a large part of their lives working abroad, but there might be in the back of our mind some kind of desire of building for the next generation. So you're motivated in part by a sense of patriotism, really? Yeah, I would say yes. Iistater says it's invested in nearly 40 tech companies back in Italy, but again, hardly any of them are in the South. The overall distribution of investments in Italy is quite unbalanced towards north. Unbalanced towards the north? Yeah. Around 60% of venture capital investments are done in Lombardy alone. 60%? 60%? Yes. Which basically means Milan. Do you think that what's happening in Naples now, that might make a difference? Many of the activities that have been done recently are putting good seats for making a tech ecosystem grow in the area but it's not something that can be done in even five six years it requires decades back in Naples I encountered similar caution I'm in the Naples railway museum and I'm in what would once have been a huge train shed. But today it's hosting what I can only describe as a business speed dating event, trying to match southern Italian high-tech companies and startups with foreign investors. In front of me, I've got a sign with the 17 nations that are being wooed here today. They include delegations from China, Korea, Poland, India, USA and UK. My name is Britt Becking and I work for QVentures, which is a collective of investors based in London, but our investors are from over 20 countries. And is the Naples start-up tech scene? Is it a thing? To be honest, I do not think it's a thing. I don't think there's a trend where there's specialist tech coming from here because it's just the lack of ecosystem and the lack of other investors, basically. Because I was going to say, you're here. Yes, exactly. Despite everything, despite your sort of reservations. Yeah, no, exactly. But that's because I do think the Italian trade agency is doing a great job at facilitating this. And I think they're paying for everything. They're paying for your flight, accommodation, everything. And we'll have done for all the delegates who are here from overseas. Let me ask you, do you think you'll end up investing in anything as a result of being here? Really hard to say at this stage. The quality of businesses is really not bad. I would say quite good. It's just unlucky, I guess, for the entrepreneurs here, that they're here. And I would recommend to all of them, but maybe that's too narrow in my view, but to try and expand to a place like London, Berlin, Silicon Valley, where ecosystems are, a place where they can actually raise decent capital. But that's exactly what the tech entrepreneurs I spoke to in Naples don't want. Take Paolo Yosevoli of Evia. He hopes investors will bet on the South. With just a small investment, they can get a very big return. If you want to invest in Germany, you have to invest a lot of money to achieve a small improvement because things are already working so good there that the room for a further improvement is quite narrow. Here, it takes a small investment to get a huge return. What we did with less than 3 million euros funding, we achieved really important goals. And Fabrizio Perone of Basul is convinced a little goes much further in Naples. If we started in the US or something like that, we probably would have need 10 or 15 million. Plus in Naples you get to stand out from the crowd. If you manage to achieve your goal, you would be like one of the very few companies that made it. It gets a lot of visibility. I mean, you are interviewing me, why? Because I'm from Naples. If I were from Berlin, I don't think that I would be so interesting, right? So it's a good starting point. A starting point is all it is for now, but Naples has had to reinvent itself numerous times. Over the centuries, it's been the capital of duchies, kingdoms and empires. Even its name derives from the Greek Neapolis, meaning new city. Why not then, a capital of tech? That was global business on the BBC World Service with me, Manuela Saragossa. The producer was Rosamond Jones. The editor was Helen Grady."}
