This podcast is supported by advertising outside the UK. BBC Sounds, music, radio, podcasts. So my character's just rushing along through the words. He's rushing into a fight here. When you say click, I never know whether you mean left or right. Sorry, left click over here. Yeah. Okay, then. And I can right click to or right. Sorry, left click over here. Yeah. Okay, then. Right click to move around. Oh yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah. If you press Q, that'll activate your sort of main area ability. Oh, yeah, yeah. Unfortunately, you've just been taken down by a necrophos. By a what? A necrophos. Whom I didn't even see. I'm diving into a world of witches and football playing cars, where athletes don't even have to be in the same country to compete against each other. Welcome to e-sports. Waltz for now, and turning the other way, it's Vitality. Oh my man, back over to keep off his good eye! My justice! Sh is Vitality. Very big. Back over to the key office, get away! My Justin! Shorty! Vitality! Offensive cry! You see it coming. You're going to press that button in time. I think there was around 10,000 people in the crowd, and the crowd went crazy. We could barely hear each other. And now a shout-up, we're doing no pass! John! It's just your chance of saying, you know what? all of this was worth it, this is how good I am. The innovation we're creating with and through esports, the way that young generations interact with media, with games and esports, is transcending outside of esports. I don't know if video games were part of your childhood. I remember chunky, clunky arcade machines, emitting sounds like this. Vanity arcade, the Defender is there. Down off of Broadway Who's they're playing his games By the time my producer Lizzie was growing up The games had developed And for teenagers today Like my son Things have moved on again Good job guys Yeah All right I'll get her Okay on again. Good job, guys. Yeah. All right. I'll get her. Okay. Over it. Covering. Covering. But to some, they're just a bit of fun or an escape, down at the arcade. Down at the arcade. Though like many parents, I worry about how much time my son spends gaming. But for others, it's a competitive and lucrative business. The industry is worth millions, if not billions of dollars. It's a world in which people from across the globe don't just play. They're also online, watching others playing. I needed to find out more about this actual and virtual reality. First stop, Leipzig, Germany. This is a giant hangar, at least 100 meters long and 100 meters wide. There are ranks and ranks of computers. I've never seen so many. And wow, ferry lights on top of a gazebo. This one says Team Fabulous. So I guess it's Team Fabulous are stuck under that gazebo. It looks like one of these relief aid centres because there are lines and lines and lines of blow-up beds and duvets and bags of clothes. Clearly the players who are playing aren't expected to leave this hall anytime soon. This is a Lan local area network party organised by Dreamhack, a Swedish production company which specialises in e-sports tournaments. Just so we're clear, esports is competitive gaming. In 2016, a thousand people spent three days here. This year, numbers have grown to 2,000, each paying up to 325 euros. Hello. What is this game? This is raft. Raft. This is a survival game in the ocean. Yes. And is this a shark? It's a shark, yeah. The shark is following the raft and wants to eat them. And how long will you play today? Today, I don't know. 14, 15, 16 hours today. Hello, what were you playing? Right now I'm playing Overwatch. Overwatch, okay. How long have you been here? Since Friday. So that's yesterday? Yeah. And you're staying at the whole event. And all day long in here? No, God no. You need to get out sometimes and see some daylight. Yeah. Go on morning books or the Expo. Enjoy the expo. We spend a lot of time just talking with the people we haven't seen for a long time. Enjoy the expo. We spend a lot of time just talking with the people we haven't seen for a long time. For those people who don't understand gaming or e-sports, what is it that grips you about it? Well, at first it's a hobby, yeah. You gotta do what makes fun, so... How much money would you say you spend on this hobby? I can't say this. It's a lot. A lot. Okay. It was noticeable that the vast majority here were young men. For them, this event was like a music festival, where they gathered once a year to meet up with old friends and set aside three days to indulge in their hobby or passion. Back in the real world, they had real jobs and they look forward to returning again next year. But this festival goes way beyond the land hall. There's a second giant hanger. More than 20,000 people attended Dreamhack Leipzig this year. The halls swarmed with festival-goers. Some of them dressed up as their favourite gaming characters, a giant horned rat, elves, winged warriors, actually really impressive outfits. They were preparing for a cos or costume play competition. All sorts of pop-up stalls and shops, well, just popped up, selling computer hardware, gadgets, even self-heating pads to keep those gaming muscles loose. Not many games, or any games that I can see, I'm a massive curved screen here. A mere 1,299 euros, mugs and glasses and dormats. It's a marketing paradise. You're part of this whole store, you're selling anything? MediaMark is a brand in Germany. What's here on the DreamHague is more like the PC gaming area or something, a bit like consoles. And so we get here components keyboards mousees mouse pads headsets and all the stuff you get here so very cheap prices so they get a special deal for coming here yes clearly it's also lucrative for the companies the checkout queues snaked around the shop then there was the main event the League tournament. A three-aside football game, not with footballers, but with cars, yes, cars kicking the ball. A crowd watches a giant screen as two teams of real human players line up against each other. They sit behind their respective desks, each with a monitor and keyboard, wearing headphones and a microphone. It looks a bit like a souped-up university challenge. The music glare, spotlights dance across the ceiling. These professionals, with names like Violent Panda, Fairy Peak and Turbo Pulsor, are battling it out for a $100,000 prize pool. Dignitas! On your license, Renanthin, champion! In the final, Team Dignitas eventually defeated Renault Vitality, and yes, they do have big-name sponsors. It was exhausting to watch. Like with any sport, I got sucked into the excitement and began to understand the appeal. Even of cars playing football in a virtual underwater dome watched by hundreds on site and many thousands more online. But I wanted to know more about the money behind e-sports. How do you actually make a living playing, well, games? Off to Berlin to meet Jens Hilgers, the founder of the first European e-sports league, and more recently of Bitcraft, the world's first e-sports investment firm. Are you, yes, that's me. Hi, how's it going? John? Hey, how's it going? Nice to meet you. Just follow me right here. The impact of what is being created in esports is kind of larger than just within esports, if you understand what I mean. Give me a taste of that. I know, for example, that you invest in different companies that are doing all sorts of different things, including food companies. If we claim esports are a next generation sport, then there's a big likelihood that things that have worked in traditional sports should somehow work in e-sports, right? So the performance nutrition company that we built about three, four years ago now, is a company that's been saying, like, well, if there's performance nutrition for traditional sports athletes, then there should be performance nutrition for esports athletes. Our nutrition products focus on mental endurance, on mental stamina. So if you have a two, three hours gaming session, the performance supplements of that company help you to be really kind of sharp during that time period. So if you include all these new products, how much is the total e-sports industry worth? I would attribute a big part of the revenues of the companies that provide these games or that hardware to esports as well. If you do that, you're talking not about a billion in turnover of revenue. You're probably talking 20, 30 billion in turnover and revenue that you can associate with esports. That's a lot of money. Yeah, that would be a pretty large market, yeah. E-sports and video games together are worth $137 billion globally. Compare this to the more established music industry with its record sales and concerts. That's worth $130 billion. Despite any concerns from the media and parents about teenagers spending long hours locked in their bedrooms gaming, esports is big business. Do you have any concerns about it? The fundamental concern is with video games at large is like we're sort of spending time in virtual realities. We got to be thoughtful about the balance that brings with itself. What I love about esports is that esports creates a beautiful bridge between these two worlds. Because in esports, we're not losing people somewhere in a game. We're actually creating stars out of people. With these people being out there and demonstrating to every single gamer, if you want to be good in a game, if you want to succeed in a game, like, you should actually work out. You should actually be communicative with a team of friends and build your own social peer group and then you will succeed in those games. The virtual world is just equally good as the real kind of world out there. So, e-sports must be a sport by definition, right? Because I'm still not convincing my parents. It doesn't matter what game that is, that e-sports is better than soccer. That's not going to happen, right? They will always consider this something that happens on a screen, and so they will never accept it as a sport. For yens, esports offer a tantalizing prospect to investors, and investors are flocking to it, computer companies, of course, but also car companies, even shampoo manufacturers, are getting involved in sponsorship. And top clubs like Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain and FC Roma have their own e-sports teams, usually playing FIFA the football game. As in traditional sports, players get bought and sold by the esports clubs. So who are these professional players? Quite a few of them hang around and train in Berlin. You've got the players who come in here. This is their office. This is where they train. They live nearby, I understand. And they just come here. It's like a job. Yeah, it is. They come in here usually. Not 9 a.m. It's like a job. Yeah, it is. They come in here usually. Not 9 a.m. It's like not a 9 to 5 job, right? No, you wouldn't expect gamers to be coming in. No. So for example, our schedule, we start with practice against other teams in like scrimmage games. Usually they come in at like 11, 12, sit here, warm up a little bit, chat to each other. Then we have lunch together. We have a briefing meeting together. Like, what is it we want to achieve today, like how do we want to tackle practice today. And yeah, and then they start practicing until usually a little bit late at night. That's Jan Hoffman, the manager of one of Fanatic's teams. Fanatic is arguably the most successful Western e-sports club. This particular team in this light and airy Berlin apartment competes in the game League of Legends, supported by coaches, analysts, psychologists. On the side, I will have a bulgour with carrots and a team chef. And for tonight we'll have chicken baked with bacon, champonions. In the main training room there are five desks with state-of-the-art computers and monitors. On the wall, above each desk, hangs a shirt like a football shirt, printed with a gaming name of the player. The first one to turn up was Broxer, real name Madsbrock Pedersen from Denmark, 21 years old, tall, athletic, and frankly much more eloquent than many regular sports players. Often before even coming to the office, I like going to the gym as well. So this morning I've just been at the gym, went back, show out, and then my day starts here at the office after. So how important is it to actually be fit to play well? I actually think it's more important than people normally think, because going to the gym and just generally exercising in one way and another actually helps a lot with focus and confidence and feeling better about yourself. So while it doesn't have the same impact in the same sense it does in physical sport, it's still important due to a lot of different factors, I think. Do some physical activity and get some time away from the PC as well to play properly. Here you are. I don't know what time it is. It's late morning, let's say. What time do you expect to stop your day job? Well, most often it's around 11, 12 in the evening. So it's some long days of practice. So it is a 12 hour day at least. I don't play like constantly in those hours, but most of those hours being spent either talking strategy with the team and looking at all the teams playing the game or preparing for matches or whatever it may be. And I can see you're in the full kit. You've got your fanatic trousers on. Well, I've been playing for this team for a little over two years now. So I guess at this point, I'm kind of a fanatic that some would say. And before that, were you playing for another team? I was actually mainly focused on high school. I'm a bit different in that regard because most players drop out of high school to try to attempt being a pro player. But whenever I do something, I always want to do it to the fullest. So in the middle of high school, when I started playing on a level where I could consider becoming a professional League of Legends player, I didn't want to mess up my grades and I wanted to actually finish first. And then after finishing, I took a year off, and then after a few months I ended up joining Fanatic. Now that you're professional, do you still enjoy it? I do still enjoy the game but it's not pure joy anymore. There's also a lot of work aspects that influences it and I feel like I have periods where I don't like it that much where I have to force myself to just play the game and then I have other periods where I still just love it. And how long do you expect your career to last? I feel like it's really hard to say. When I joined Fanatic a bit over two years ago, I didn't know if it was going to be one year or two years or five years because everything is so new. And in League of Legends compared to some other video games, there's a lot of grinding involved, like playing the game a ton because the game changes a lot almost, I think, around every second week, there's changes. And these changes are changes brought in by the developers? Yeah, exactly. They're just tweaking the game. They're constantly tweaking the game to make it a little different, a little exciting. And as pro players, we always have to be on top of that. And sometimes it would happen that just randomly one day, three champions that I've never played before are really strong, and then I have four days to learn to play those at a professional level. And these champions are basically characters? They are, yeah, they are characters with different spells and skill sets and all that. Next to turn up was Bwipo, real name Gabriel Rau. Again, he didn't fit the monosyllabic stereotype. Quite the opposite. It was difficult to get him to stop talking. So Bwipo, from Belgium, you've just arrived. Pretty much, yeah, yeah. We didn't force you in early, do we? A little bit, but that's fine. I don't mind. You don't mind? That's how it works. Like, for example, tomorrow I have a podcast, so 9.30, and then the day after it will probably be like 12 or 1245. And how big do you expect esports to become in the next few years? That's always an interesting question, sometimes difficult to answer because I think it's going to keep getting bigger and bigger, that's for sure. I don't think it's getting smaller. That I can guarantee you. It's becoming more of a normal sports thing. With this generation, about to have children and moving forward, I feel like it might even become a staple. Might become as normal as sports right now. I don't think it necessarily has to be a bad thing. It is time consuming though, so I feel like if you do want to introduce anybody especially children in the video games, discipline is the way to go. Hmm, easier said than done. Hi, how you doing? You're Sam? Yes, that's me. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. As I've said, Fanatic is one of the biggest names on the esports scene. It now has 10 different teams competing in different games worldwide, with offices in San Francisco, Berlin, Belgrade and Kuala Lumpur. It all began back in 2004 when a then 19-year-old Southampton University student, Sam Matthews, saw an opportunity. Well, actually, I sold my car and sent the first team over to the US. So use the proceeds from your car to employ some players? Yeah, that I found on the internet. Sam and Fanatic have come a long way since then, as you can tell from the swanky headquarters in Shoreditch, East London, and its teams have been hugely successful. Both Wippo and Broxer were part of the team that came second in the League of Legends World Final last year. They were beaten by an outfit based in China. It might not surprise you to know that the Chinese and the South Koreans take e-sports very seriously. It's even been announced that e-sports will be medal events in the Asian games in 2022, taking place in Hangzhou. No longer do game developers make their money by simply selling their games. Many are now free to play. In return, you make in-game purchases, like costume changes, skins as they're called. It's a good way of keeping players interested and involved. Some would say hooked. What the model is now is really, you know, let's make a game, test it quite quickly with our audience, see if they resonate and then keep adding people to it and actually making it better iteratively. And then you make money from micro transactions. So things like cosmetic upgrades. So in the case of say Fortnite, everyone's heard about the dance moves. You know, obviously we've all done the floss. And that's a cosmetic upgrade. So it's like you can... And you buy that. Yeah. And it's actually super innovative the way they've done it specifically because they've made it kind of the scarce shop which launches every day and you can only get it that day if you want to get that skin or that that dance move. I don't know the direct number but I've heard quite good sources that it was five billion in revenue last year and three billion in profit. So they're obviously done a pretty good job of monetizing a free game. As for Sam, his business isn't just running esports teams. He's branched out into branded clothing and hardware. And you have these plastic cases with all sorts of keyboards, mouse's, mice. Mice, yeah. And right in the middle, you have a great big cup. That's a trophy we won, ESL Cologne, actually, that one. We've actually got about four of those trophies. We've always had a strong brand. You know, we've been the most successful Western esports team on the planet. In 2015, acquired a company who makes gaming equipment, and we really thought that there was an opportunity to do it differently to really represent the esports aspect, because we think it's here to stay. It's going to be a huge global phenomenon. What eosports does is it's actually got insane engagement. It's accessing that sort of 15 to 30-year-old gamer, which is one of the hardest places to reach for brands. Are you guys making a profit? We were. Obviously, the first initial years, we didn't make a profit, and then we made profit for about seven years. And then in the last few years, we've been investing heavily into our business. Ultimately, e-sports is really exploding in the last two or three years. With that, there is staying ahead of the rest means that we constantly need to innovate. What I also want to avoid is I want to make a resilient business, right? That we're not just reliant on one revenue stream. And that's why we've done the hardware and the apparel because it's more like we control our own destiny then. So, yeah, we're losing money, but we're growing 40, 50% a year in revenues. So it's a goal to be break even in the next couple of years. Again, number one is really maintaining that top three esports position. And that's got a lot more expensive, right? You've got more competition than ever. You've got teams in America who've raised 50 million. And so talent has gotten more expensive and players. The players are more expensive to buy. Totally. And pay. So our player costs have gone up a lot. How much does an average player get? Depends in the game. So, you know, in games like League of Legends, good players will range from, I would say, starting in the LEC from 200,000 a year. That's the European League. Yeah, $200,000 a year up to, say, $700,000 a year. And that's before prize money? Yeah, that's just pure salary. Nice. Yeah, it's pretty good for them. Salaries in North America and Asia can be even higher, with top players earning over a million dollars a year. Keen to get access to a young audience, more and more companies like Mercedes and Kier and L'Oreal are getting involved in sponsorship. Esports events are getting bigger and bigger. Katovita in Poland attracted over 170,000 people to its festival this year. Over a million more watched online. The main competition had a price pool of a million US dollars. All that money means more opportunities and more jobs. That's what Staffordshire University noticed, so last year it set up a degree focused on the business of e-sports. Yes, hello. Hello. Angela Lawrence lectures in the business school, but she's also the course leader of the BA honours degree called simply e-sports. One of the biggest criticisms probably from people who didn't know what we were doing was, why would you want to set up a degree course so that people spend nine grand a year to play games? Well, they absolutely don't play games. They come here and they learn all about how to set up esports events, the finances, the leadership and management of esports, and also the more technical side, how to actually stage events, how to do the streaming, the lighting, the voiceovers, the broadcasting, and all the more technical part of it. We were introduced to three students who took up this course when it began last September, Maddie, Eden and Kieran. I've always played games and I've always wanted to sort of run events and help on the back end of that kind of stuff. Personally compared to other people on this course I think I got into gaming pretty late, but I very quickly got lost in it. In a good way? Yeah, I would like to think so anyway. I became a lot more confident when I started gaming and And I think it grew my confidence a lot more, and I actually learnt more about myself, really. My main game is League of Legends. Middle of last year, I learnt about the World Championships for League of Legends, and to me it was just the most fascinating thing. And when you look at the background of how it all comes together and the people that spend all that time getting into it for me I would love to put something like that together not so much play it but to put that together and create that experience for other people and that was just my main aspiration really you didn't want to be a player but it's professional player it would love to be a player but I'm never going to be that good so it takes a lot of practice it does take a lot of practice yeah so I think I'll I'll do the next best thing and I'll run the teams and professional player? I would love to be a player, but I'm never going to be that good. So... Takes a lot of practice. It does take a lot of practice, yeah. So I think I'll do the next best thing and I'll run the teams instead. And the university believes there are plenty of people like Kieran, Eden and Maddie. Later this year, it'll be expanding its e-sports degree by opening a course based in the Olympic Park in London. At the heart of e-sports are the games developers and the professional opening a course based in the Olympic Park in London. At the heart of esports are the games developers and the professional players, along with their coaches, managers and psychologists. But there are also amateurs and influencers who film themselves and stream their gaming online, some getting millions of views and earning sponsorship deals. And there are those who develop keyboards and monitors or specialist computer chairs for e-sports. There are clothing companies, events organizers, commentators or shoutcasters. In this world of virtual reality, it seems virtually anything is possible. And there are plenty of people out there willing to spend their money and time watching and taking part. How! Subway! Turbo is that! What's the save by Turbo! This has been one of the craziest games ever! Here you are again, day three. Yes. How are you feeling now, day three. Yes. How are you feeling now? Very tired, ready to head back home in our normal life. But it was a lot of fun. It's once a year and it's always an amazing experience and we're happy to be here. I hope you enjoyed that exploration of e-sports. I'm John Murphy, and my esteemed producer was Lizzie McNeill.
