This podcast is supported by advertising outside the UK. It's me rubbing my hands up and down the grill fencing with razor wire on top and there are one, two, three, I think four lines of fencing and a ditch. And just the other side, of aeroplanes just parked. This is supposed to be the UK's second busiest airport, Gatwick. And yet there's nothing moving. Not a plane taking off or landing. The aviation industry has been remarkably badly hit by the economic lockdown. Something like a, you know, 97-98% reduction in flights. So for this in business, I'm taking a slightly sideways look at Gatwick, seeing what impact it has particularly on the town right on its edges, Crawley, which one report has suggested may well be the worst affected urban centre in the UK by the economic shutdown. It's early June when I pay my first visit to Crawley, but I'll be returning across the next few weeks to see how the town and local businesses are coping. I should introduce you to the town. There was a Saxon settlement here in the 5th century, wind forward a few hundred years to the 1930s and the first scheduled flights took off from Gatwick. During the Second World War, it became an RAF base. Gatwick, the seven million pound project which is to take some of the strain off London airport, is ready for action. In 1950, Gatwick was designated as London's second airport. On its southern boundary, Crawley was developing as a post-war new town. Today, it has a population of around 115,000. There's another slightly surprising fact about the place. Well, it was a surprise to me. Yes, the cure first strutted their stuff in Crawley. Away from the stage and the makeup, an important economic fact about Crawley is that traditionally it's had very low unemployment. Not so true now. We had 120 cars, we're down to about 25, 30 cars. And work-wise, we used to do 12, 1,500 jobs a day, and we're doing 1,500 jobs a week. Marwas Khan is the director of the taxi firm, United Cars, based in the High Street. Big reduction? Big reduction, yes. And what's the essential cause for that? The essential cause is Gatwick Airport. It's a good eyes closed, really. I think we've done two jobs, three jobs in and out of Gatwick in the last two months. And normally you do, how many? Normally we're six, seven hundred jobs a day, there and back here. Pre-pandemic, there were 12 permanent staff members in the office. All but three were furloughed. On my June visit, Linda 12 permanent staff members in the office. All but three were furloughed. On my June visit, Linda's the only one answering the phones. How busy are you? Not busy at all, very quiet. It just rang there, but there's just one of you in this room. Yeah. And would it be buzzing the whole time? Yeah. I mean, I worked yesterday. I had done 12-hour shift and there was only 132 calls I took all day. What would you expect to take? About 700. Oh, okay. So it's a massive drop. A huge drop. A drop in calls naturally leads to a drop in jobs and profits. What's the kind of turnover you normally have financially? Probably a couple of million pound a year. Or, you know, that's totally gone. What would it be down to, do you think now? If this was a whole... To go actually, I've not even counted. It's just, you know, it's not even worth adding up. It's peanuts. Peanuts, yeah, I just do it on my fingers now, so, yeah. Can you survive? Not for long, but yeah, there's a bit of a bright future because something's got to come about really we can't just sort of collapse or we'll just we'll try and keep going see what happens. But are you saying this sort of like with the sort of fingers crossed strategy just hoping or yeah really to be honestly that's the bottom line of it yeah and your furloughed staff is there a sense that in effect they don't know that they're unemployed yet? We're hoping to bring them all back, but it's looking impossible at the moment. I think most them will end up unemployed as far as we're concerned. Well, I've reached Queen Square right in the centre of Crawley. There's a queue outside the pound land, but most of the shops, if not all of them, or just about, are, Right in the centre of Crawley. There's a queue outside the poundland. But most of the shops, if not all of them, all just about, are shut. And the only things flying are the seagulls, it seems. So Peter, unfortunately, you've just been a pooped on by a pigeon. Hopefully that's not a sign of things to come. Some people would argue that it's good luck. Peter Lamb has been labour leader of Crawley Council for the last six years. Now in his early 30s he's still one of the country's youngest council leaders. Tell me how badly you think they've suffered in Crawley because I've heard about this report that Crawley could be one of the worst hit places in the country? Yeah, I mean the town centre, like all town centres, has been struggling for a while, although we were one of very few that was actually seeing an increase in footfall over recent years, powered mostly by the growth in local economy. It's grown by almost a quarter in the time I've been council leader, and that was powering a certain amount of business growth in the town centre. But once the impact upon airport jobs goes through, all that spending, and that was powering a certain amount of business growth in the town centre. But once the impact upon airport jobs goes through, all that spending power drops out of the economy and that's the point where shops like these really start to struggle. The local industrial strategy is literally called Gawick through 60 on the basis of its impact. What Gatwick's needs is the local economy catches the cold. And that means Crawley's economy? Yeah, it does. I mean, I think people fail to realise that just because a business isn't involved in aviation doesn't mean that it avoids the impact from decline in the aviation sector here. A vast amount of local economy is in one way or another connected to the sheer amount of money that the airport brings in. All of the big players, EasyJet, British Airways and Virgin Atlantic have announced thousands of job losses. And after more than three decades there, Virgin says it will close its Gatwick hub. Like Peter Lamb, they're calling for specific government help for the aviation sector. This is the sector the government was very recently saying was critical to our survival. And yet now that things are looking a little less happy, that support doesn't seem to be there anymore for people's jobs. I think it's very difficult to be involved in discussions we're having right now with government to assume that there's any rational thinking in place at all. That's not just a Labour Party man saying that. You can talk to other council leaders. They will not necessarily say it publicly, but I'm on the conference course with them. Come fly with me, let's fly, let's fly away. Now, that report I mentioned earlier, the think tank, the Centre for Cities, has claimed that Crawley's close links to the aviation industry could make it the worst affected urban centre in the UK by the lockdown. Catherine Annenkel from Centre for Cities looked at the data. So Crawley has the largest proportion of workers on furlough in the UK. It's more than three and ten people are just on furlough. And also when we look at the latest unemployment data, we can see this. So it has the fifth highest percentage point increase in unemployment claimants in the UK. Gatwick is Crawley's single largest employer, pre-lockdown providing 24,000 jobs directly and a further 80,000 indirectly. We could see that more than half of the workforce employed in Crawley is actually dependent, very vulnerable or very vulnerable industries, particularly in aviation. That's a huge amount, I would assume, compared to other towns and cities. There's also Slough, second position, because Slough is just directly a very close located to Heathrow Airport, but it must be said also that literally every place across the UK has at least 20% of their working age population, either unemployed or unfulloat. But in Crawley, it's increased due to this aviation industry very strongly concentrated. The message, Catherine says, is that a one-size-fits-all approach won't help places like Crawley, which will need support for longer. But Gatwick isn't the only show in town. 600 businesses employing 30,000 people, are based in one of the country's largest business parks, Manor Royal. It does hugely diverse. I mean, we talked about aviation, but there's people manufacturing medical devices of all kinds, people making pies. Steve Sawyer is the director of the Manor Royal Business Improvement District. There's a kidney dialysis centre over there as well. There's loads of car showrooms. There's the biggest independent motorcycle retailer right here. Brand names like Virgin, Tarles, Electa, through to your one-man bands and people fixing your car. So, I mean, 30,000 people that's more than Gatwick actually employs directly. But thinking about Venn diagrams, there must be a sort of overlap between the two, between Manor oil employees and Gatwick employees or business. Yeah, of course. You know, there's Manoril companies who serve the airport and serve the aviation sector. So that's why we will see an impact from downtown the airport on Manor oil. But we are at a funny time because it's not very clear at the moment what those long-term sustainable trends might actually be. And it's our responsibility as policy makers to lay the foundations for those things to happen. Talking about the policy makers, are we talking essentially it's central government's got to do all this or who's going to do all this? Who's going to help it through? You can't keep looking outward for somebody else to give us a handout. They ain't going to happen. We do need support though from the government, particularly on aviation. They need to set policy. They need to provide incentives. Need to provide to support to critical, nationally critical companies. And you'd say the Gatwick is part of that? 100%. It's a shop window to our country, how we connect globally with the rest of the world. We're going to want to do that again. So we're a family business. I've got my daughter involved and my son. Coordination catering created by Gavin White and his wife Elizabeth 32 years ago is now based on Manor Royal. So we're into the great big warehouse. I can see some what fake logs. Yes. And they're cushions. Yes. We came up with the idea of doing fake hay bales. Oh fake hay bales, yes. But they're actually cushions. They look fake hay bales. Fake hay bales, yes. But they're actually cushions, they look like hay bales. Without all the mess. And what else have you got in here? Oops. What's in here? Glasses, cups. Yep. Cups. We've got all the cups, various sizes and shapes. Plates, starters, main course, everyday kind of glasses. Champagne and wine buckets. Dance floors, black and white. So basically anything and everything anybody might need for a party. Yeah. A big party. Yeah. But it's all here. It's not out. No, it's been here since March the 23rd and we don't see it going out for the foreseeable future because when the government allow things to start people won't suddenly be having a party or want equipment. It's going to take a lot of time before people get confidence and start to put things together. It won't be till next April that we actually start taking bookings and get going again. So you've not earned anything since the 23rd of March? We haven't earned a thing. We're in June. Normally this would be your busy time. Oh yes this would be tearing our hair out trying to get all the equipment back and washed up and sent out again these when I really stopped some meat on the bone June is the Derby and then you're going to Ascot and then you've got the Grand Prix and you've got Wimbledon and you've got none of that's happened or is happening none of it none of it none of it graduations and sports days in private schools and none of this has taken place it's an absolute wipeout. Brides are not getting married. They're now counselling the August-September weddings and now moving those to 2021. So for every time they move something, it lessens our chances of survival. All 22 of the full-time staff were furloughed. As directors of the company, Gavin and his wife didn't qualify. After three decades of building up the firm, March this year was when they'd hoped to be debt-free for the first time. He's been negotiating with the landlord, a pension firm, not to pay the rent until they can start earning money again. It's pointless the government furloughing the staffer at 80%. If you don't look after the companies, then what's the point of doing a furlough? Because there'll be nothing to come back to? There'll be nothing to come back to? There'll be nothing to come back to. You'll be nothing to come back to. And you're now the MD. Yeah. When did that happen? 24th of March this year. Wow. It's like the morning after the night before, because it was night before that Boris Johnson announced that we should all be staying in. That was about right, yeah. Jane Jones used to be the banker for Easy Hall, a haulage firm with 87 staff and 45 vehicles and a large warehouse in Crawley. Jane liked the company so much that, well, she eventually joined it and recently got her pandemic baptism we did take a 30% dip in income right why was that i mean people were at home doing garden projects DIY projects and ordering huge bags of um soil and gravel and pallets of turf to do garden projects so if you think about a truck this sort of size, that's a big one. That's a big one. You could probably get half as many pallets on because they all weighed a ton. Ah, so because the load was more bulky? Yep. You could get less pallets on. So instead of having 16 pallets a half a ton each, we were carrying eight pallets at one ton each. So of course your income goes down for... Because everyone's doing's doing their gardens yeah but actually i think what happened was essential became redefined um we believed essential in times like this would be moving oxygen which we're licensed to do and we moved our materials for the nightingale hospitals which is fantastic um but essential actually was about keeping people from going completely bonkers and stir crazy at home by delivering to them what they needed to be able to stay sane really. And we're now in early June. Yep. Are you still 30% down? No. We're probably about 20% up on normal volumes to the point where we've got more work than we can actually handle with our current resource. So we're using subcontractors, agency staff and third-party carriers to help us with our normal load. Easy Hall's fortunate because it has little exposure to Gatwick Airport. Inside the warehouse, high shelves are filled to the brim with all sorts of goods. A forklift truck moves pallets around. I can see beer. I can see what's that? Some kind of... Chickory. Chickory. Organicchicry. Organic chiquary. There's lots of slates, there's a bath over there. Some more barrels, metal barrels of... That's a lubricant to some description. Some kind of lubricant, gosh. Yeah, quite a big thing. The area, some suggest, could be one of the worst hit areas in the UK by this lockdown. How worried are you about the area? I'm worried about the people in the area because it's going to affect generations and the whole households and we've never had anything like that. So many businesses around here that are reliant on the airport. We're just incredibly lucky. In the scheme of things and against that context, we've done OK. Coming out of lockdown poses its own challenges. The unpredictable car and van drivers are back on the roads. And business patterns haven't settled yet. I think that's been of the biggest challenge for us, is understanding the volumes which change each day so we could go on a typical day from delivering 500 pallets and on Friday we delivered 800 pallets but next week it could be back down to 300. You can't predict from one day to the next what you're going to be facing. To survive the uncertain times, Jane deferred the £60,000 a month rent for the warehouse until September. Well, there's a tsunami of debt later on in the year, but we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. Well, a week after my first visit to this boundary fence of Gatwick Airport, I'm back again. And this is the first day of the travel quarantine coming into force which means that anybody arriving back in the UK in theory should be self-isolating for two weeks and I can see vehicles moving about some with flashing lights and there's a bit of a bit more noise going on but I am pretty certain about though is that in the 20 minutes, half an hour that I've been here, not a single plane has taken off or landed. Are they both the same? Dee Matheson is the managing director of Electa, which produces advanced cancer treatment equipment. Headquartered in Sweden, it has almost 4,000 employees worldwide, including 800 based in Crawley. Oh gosh. So this is the... These looks like big, huge scanners or something like that. Yes, so this is, in fact, an MR scanner with a linear accelerator in it. So this is our top end machine. Okay, for people who don't know what that is, scanners, I think they understand linear accelerator is doing. So a linear accelerator essentially is a big tube that accelerates electrons and then they spray out x-ray radiation. And that x-ray radiation is collimated, is shaped to hit the tumour. Now the benefit of having imaging at the time of firing that beam of radiation is clear. It's like putting on a new pair of glasses, as what one of the doctors has said. So you can just not only see the cancer, but importantly, you can see all of the pieces that you don't want to treat because x-rays will kill everything. And this is made here in Crawley? Yes. Well, one potential problem for Elector is getting its engineers back. They've been dotted around the world installing or servicing those linear accelerators and could get stuck. We've written some waiver letters that they can share with border control, say they're essential workers and try and get them exempt rather than being quarantined for 14 days so that then they can go on again to do other work and or fly off again somewhere else. Six weeks later and I'm back at my favourite airport boundary fence. I did see a plane overhead as I approached crawley but at the moment there doesn't seem to be much activity at the airport here. As for Electa, they did manage to get their engineers back into the country without having to quarantine and have got them out again to carry on their work. They're hoping that by the end of August, their factory workers will be back on the factory floor, making those important radiation machines. And De Matheson, of Electra, expects that the demand for the machines will be as high as ever because quite a lot of cancer treatment has been either cancelled or delayed during the lockdown. So what about the other businesses I've been talking to in Crawley? Hello, United. In Crawley. Hello, United. In Crawley High Street, I'm back at the cab firm, United Cars. Linda's in her usual place, answering the occasional call. Since I last met Marwaz Khan, business has picked up a bit. We're sort of up to 50% of our normal drivers. Not quite 50% of the work that we had, but yeah, drivers slowly coming back, just need the airport to open up a bit. So still no real airport action? No, not really, no, no. I think we're doing about two jobs, three jobs a day to the airport, whereas normally we'd be doing like a couple of hundred. But do you think that your business, okay, it may survive, but will it basically be smaller? Yes, definitely yes. At least for the next three or four years. Few staff in the office, a lot less money, a lot less of everything, really, yes. To get back to 100% or even to grow, is that totally dependent on Gatwick? Absolutely, yeah. Especially for Cromney, yes. For any business around here, it's dependent on Gatwick. There are no two ways about it, yeah. Especially for Cromer, yes. For any business around the year, depending on Gatwick. There are more too ways about it, yeah. Yeah, of course you can buy us, a bit more for your mum. Hello, hello. Oh, come in. There you are. Next stop during this catch-up is Coordination Catering and Gavin White. How are you? Well, sitting on your pinkish sofa. Well, this is it. This is what we've got. There's no staff. There's no anybody. One good bit of news, the company has managed to get a holiday on paying business rates, but Gavin still hasn't been able to secure a loan to tide him over. So what about the staff? Well, they're on a holiday now till next May. Wow. And hopefully... That's a long time. A nice holiday. Well... But not a paid holiday? No. There's a few we've had to make redundant. Anyway, but the others are on a holiday, so they'll go and work somewhere else and then come back to us hopefully next April May. So hopefully come back to you, but I mean they may not. That's correct. So the staff training starts all over again. And so would you say that this summer 2020, which should be when you're earning your money has been a total right-off correct as we sit here i think we've earned since the 23rd of march just under 11,000 pounds and normally that figure would be nearer what a million and i'm not letting my business go down the pan something will come out the wood the woodwork and we will fight a way through it. Hello. Welcome back. Good morning. Oh, you're sitting outside, nice. Like at a picnic table. Yeah, I know. Remember Jane Jones, who became the managing director of the transport company Easy Hall, the morning after lockdown started. Look, I can see more tracks. Yeah, absolutely. We could do with another four or five, so. A good four or five, just to cope with the volumes. It's 25% up on where we were this same week last year, and 55% up on where we were on lockdown. Wow. Yeah, a lot more of our customers are open again now. But there's still probably about 20% of the customers that haven't returned to full speed yet. So we're expecting higher volume still. We've been incredibly fortunate. We've recruited 10% more staff in the last few weeks when all around us people are being made redundant and a lot of those applications are coming from airport staff that have been made redundant, which is really sad. But it's had such a devastating effect on the wider community. Walking through the pedestrianised centre of Crawley you can see more shops open especially coffee places. In terms of actual shoppers though it's noticeably quiet. I meet up again with the Labour leader of the council, Peter Lamb. Increasing numbers of employers are letting people go and people are finding that there isn't much else to apply for. If you lose thousands of people in one go in a single economy, they're going to have some very good CVs going, but it's all going to be going to be going to the same few jobs. You know, it's not going to make the employment that's necessary to counter out the effect of the government's ongoing restrictions around aviation. So in the end, Gatwick needs to come back. Look, if it's not safe to open, it's not safe to open. But what a government can't do is intervene massively in the market and then shrug and say, well, it's not our fault if anything goes under. They need a sector-specific deal for aviation. The pandemic, the economic lockdown and a reluctance to go out so much have all had an impact across the country. Some towns like Crawley and some sectors have been more seriously hit than others. As the furlough scheme tapers off, unemployment levels are likely to rise significantly. More businesses will go to the wall. Gatwick and the aviation industry could take years to recover if ever. That has an impact all the way down the chain on businesses, on families and on individuals. That was my colleague John Murphy talking about businesses in Crawley at his favourite airport boundary fence. I'm Darren Graham. I was the producer. The program was mixed by Neil Churchill and the editor of the series was Penny Murphy.
