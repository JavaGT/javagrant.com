Right, I'm off to the pub, quarantine style, though it's not so much me going to the pub as, well, you'll see. I was going to use a broom handle, but I just found this. That's a telescopic pole. I think it might be used when you're painting a ceiling or something like that. But I'm going to use it and I'm going to strap this microphone to the end of it with some trusty gaffer tape. I'm quite strong. No, you haven't stumbled across an amateur DIY show. Like many people, I'm having to adapt how I do things to continue working. It's fairly sturdy to me. I'm fortunate. I still have a job, though I have had to channel my inner engineer. But what about other companies that thrive off client interaction? I've been finding out how four different businesses have been adapting to survive life under lockdown. There's my door. It's a bit cumbersome this up. Hello. Hello, John. Here I am with my extendable microphone. Look there. Great piece of engineering. Could you just reassure the listeners that we are actually keeping social distance? I'd say we're a good seven feet away from each other, which is way over the six foot six guidelines. Yeah. I'd never like to get that close to you anyway, John. Michael Wren is the owner of my local watering hole, the long pond. A micro pub set up five years ago in what used to be a small, Michael Wren is the owner of my local watering hole, the Long Pond. A micro pub set up five years ago in what used to be a small bathroom showroom in Eltham in South East London. It specialises in beer from Kent. The government's order in March for restaurants, cafes and pubs to close indefinitely was both a blow to the great British tradition of going down the boozer and also a huge economic hit for the tens of thousands of pubs and breweries across the UK. However, here Michael is, and carefully placed at my doorstep in a small plastic gerry can are four pints of Kentish ale. That's four pints of the finest pond life. Elton's favourite beer. Off licences and other alcohol retailers were soon awarded essential business status. Cue Michael and his family setting up a delivery service. We can't go to the pub, so they come to us. Everything we normally have on sale in the pub, the same range of beer as we've got, yeah. But it's just beer you're selling? No, wine as well. Yeah, wine. I've had to reorder twice since this has started. And Prosecco and the English sparkling wine and the bottles of lager that we get from Whitslebury. We're selling those as well. And christen nuts and pork scratchings. So it's a veritable pub on wheels? It is, indeed, yeah. Yeah, and pork scratchings. So it's a veritable pub on wheels? It is indeed, yeah, yeah. And it's wonderful. And what also has made me realize that there is not just because of the lockdown, there is a market out there for people, especially young couples with kids who can't go out, you know, stay on Friday night, have a pizza or an Indian take away, and they want some decent beer. So once we're back to normal, we'll be carrying on this because it's very popular. How many of these deliveries do you actually do per day per week? Loads. I mean, yesterday we did 43. 43 separate deliveries? 43 deliveries yesterday, yeah, yeah. Over the Easter weekend, we were doing 60 plus a day. Even Tuesday this week was busy. We did 40-odd than Tuesday. Michael's pub is a small family-run venture, with smaller overheads than larger establishments. He usually employs a few people, mainly students, part-time. Not now. Under lockdown, the booze booking process is simple. You message him, he calls you back, tells you what's on offer, you give your bank card details, and hey, presto, that, you give your bank card details, and hey presto, that afternoon you get your liquid delivery. Most popular for those with a stamina are the eight-pint metal casks. It's not like running a pub, is it? I mean, are you still making profit? Our turnover is up. It's higher than when we're open, but the profit margins are narrow. We don't make as much on the little tins as we would on a whole barrel. But nothing significant, and I haven't got any wages to pay up. It's just my family, because we've got to keep it the whole place confined to other people that we live with. You know, we can't have any people coming from outside. Was there a time when you thought, you know, you're going to be in trouble? Not really because on the day the pub shut, the 20th, I'd already decided to shut myself. I thought I'd just be doing the takeaways of the four-point things that you've had delivered today, but it's soon clear that people started saying, oh, what about those minis you have at Christmas? Because that's when we normally sell those mini cars. So I got onto my two main breweries and just took everything that they had. And that all went in a couple of days, so I realised I had to get some more. So, yeah, I've read about these large pubs having to throw out millions of points. You haven't had to do that. No, all our stock has gone. All our stock. No wastage. No, nothing at all. Profit margins may be more narrow, but Michael says the delivery service is helping him to cope personally, as well as professionally. So are you enjoying this? I'm loving it. This is a real new lease of life. I'm busy from 9 o'clock till 7 o'clock. It's a full day and it goes really quickly. And I've learnt all the streets in Elton I never knew existed as well. I could always take up minicab in afterwards. I never knew existed as well. I could always take up minicabin afterwards. Now we go from small to very large. I'm certainly still using antipersment and deodorant each day. Even though we're speaking remotely, it's good to know that some standards are being kept. But Richard Slater's discussing an important point. He's the head of research and development for one of the world's biggest companies, the Anglo-Dutch multinational Unilever. Like many businesses during this pandemic, this consumer goods giant, which boasts that 2.5 billion people use its products each day has also had to change the way it does things and what it produces. I would say the biggest single shift has been to make sure we can get enough soap, hand cleansers and cleaners and sanitiser product for healthcare workers, frontline workers and the public. That's meant converting some production lines of deodorants and antiperspirants to boost the manufacture of sanitizer. We actually only had a very small number of factories producing sanitizers prior to the crisis, four or five around the whole world. We've ramped that up to more than 30 plants. One of the largest factories now partly converted is in Leeds. Usually making Dove, Lynx and sure aerosols, the factory is now also producing hand gels and sanitisers and donating them to the NHS. Unilever has a portfolio of 400 brands from food, drink, cleaning agents to personal care products with plenty of household names. Marmite, Ben and Jerry's ice cream, Lipton Tea. Some lines have suffered during the lockdowns around the world. Ice cream isn't necessarily a priority in a pandemic. And with restaurants closed, many food products have taken a hit. But others like soap have seen a spike in demand. We also see demand for care products because if you're washing your hands many times a day, you can very easily get dry, cracked hands, skin problems. And it's important you deal with that in terms of protection from infection as well. In many parts of the world, mask use is highly prevalent. And so that also can cause issues wearing a mask many, many hours a day that needs to be dealt with. With many of us now stuck indoors, with extremely restricted social lives, sales of certain products have declined. In terms of hair care, deodorant and antipersmentant use. We've seen some shift in demand there. When you say a shift in demand, just to be blunt, you're saying people are spending perhaps less money on making themselves look and smell good. So it isn't a complete switch off of not using the products anymore. One of the triggers being going out, either socialising or out for the day. And so, yeah, we do see some changes in the demand for deodorants, antiperspirants, hair care products. Despite everything, Richard Slater says Unilever has, by and large, managed to keep its supply chains intact, with staff working from home or on the factory floor. We've got the thermal testing going on. We've got very, very strict distance and use of PPE strictly, sanitiser stations, cleaning stations. Have you, maybe particularly in the UK, had to furlough staff? No, we haven't taken steps of furlough staff in the UK or around the world. So all Unilever staff are still working? Yes, we made a commitment and we've not furloughed any staff or nor do we intend to at this time. With the turnover of 52 billion euros last year, Unilever clearly has greater financial flexibility to cope with economic shocks than smaller companies. Unilever's been able to tweak what it produces, but what about more specialist outfits? This would be the normal rush hour, but Oxford Street's looking pretty quiet, a few buses, the occasional car, just off Oxford Street. Here we are, McCulloch and Wallet Limited, established 1902, Fabrics, Haberdasherie, and the closed sign on the door. Morning. Morning. Nice stick. Yes, the microphone on a pole is still featuring heavily in this production. Meet Victoria Connolly, co-owner and director of McCulloch and Wallace. France, Australian, America, Canada. Well, you send stuff to there? Yeah. Really? Yeah. It's madness. Through its history, McCullick and Wallace has had to weather two world wars and the global flu pandemic of 1918. Since Edwardian times, they've sold everything a dressmaker, milliner or textile crafter could want. On the ground floor, there are giant rolls of all sorts of fabric, as well as samples you can snip bits off. There's a flock of nine wooden sheep serving as shelving for balls of wool. 5,000 hanks of tapestry yarn hang from a slat wall, and at the back of the shop there's a giant cutting table. Downstairs is the territory of multi-coloured ribbons, trims and buttons. But the place is quiet, devoid of customers. So how's business going? Business is brisk. Mail order business is brisk. Shop business, not so much. Zero. Obviously. Yeah, because you have a closed sign which remains closed all day. Yes, yes. So how much of an increase is mail order? So, mail order is up about 50%. But does that really make up for the loss of shop business? No, it doesn't because mail order is about 10% of our business, maybe a bit more, 15%. So, no, it doesn't. Is it keeping your head above water? No, I think it's allowing us to pay the rent, probably. Just about. The monthly rent is £15,000. Those kinds of figures are a worry for many shops, pubs and businesses of all types, even if the government announced a loan scheme to help. So what other expenses do you have at the moment? Well... I mean you have your rent, obviously, it's the big one, I guess. We're a rent in our rates that we are not having to pay. That's about £6,000 a month. The rates you don't have to pay? Yeah, for the moment. We have to pay rental on the credit card machines, of which we have six. We're currently using one. We have a licence for the software on every computer, which we have six we're currently using one we have a license for the software on every computer which we have 12 currently we're using one or two we're not spending so much on loo paper and instant coffee and milk so that's a saving so there's a silver lining sort of what are the things you are selling? We're selling elastic and bias binding and interlining. What's all that for? The elastic and the bias bindings for making masks. Oh. There's a lot of people making masks for themselves and for the NHS. And for local medical purposes, I think. Some of them more organised than others. And so what about you getting your elastic in? What happens to you get that stuff? We have a lot of elastic. You just have huge stores of it. We have quite a lot of stock of all sorts of elastic. We don't have much elastic left. That is the elastic they want. But we have other elastics. We're not about to buy anything in it. Most it comes from Spain. And they are either not producing or producing for their local domestic medical market, I think. So once you run out of elastic, that's it. When we run out the elastic they want, they can have a different elastic and then when we run out, we could order some more. Except we don't really want to order any more right now. Because? Because we have quite a lot of stock that we order any more right now. Because? Because we have quite a lot of stock that we're not setting right now and we have to pay our suppliers for our March-April purchases. So we pay most of our suppliers on 30 days. So we're paying now for stuff we had a month ago. And we were buying normally maybe two months ago. So we have a lot of stock that we have to pay for we don't want any more stock because you haven't got the money coming in exactly so how long are you going to be able to continue like this well i was just thinking actually that if the lockdown was lifted it would be more difficult for us, actually. Because? Because we would need a lot more staff to operate the shop under social distancing regulations. And it's only so big. And it's only so big. And previously we had about 300 paying customers a day, which is probably about 500 people through here. So if we had contact tracing, we'd probably shut in about a day because there'd be a lot of people passing through. Unlike Michael's family-run pub business, McCulloch and Wallace normally employs 18 people. Under current circumstances, it's been impossible to retain them all. That's where the government's furlough scheme comes in, paying 80% of salaries of workers who can't make it to work. They have 15 furloughed staff and three staff, including me, who come in during the week to pack mail orders. When they get furloughed, is that their choice or is that your choice? A bit of both. Most of them can't come in anyway. Or wouldn't want to come in because they have to take public transport and we need minimum of three people to keep this going and only three of us can get here. I'm here five days a week and the other two are here two or three days a week. Because it seems unfair to make them work five days when their colleagues are working no days and getting paid for three days. Slight problem with the furlough scheme. Despite the fact that they only work two to three days a week, they're being paid full-time? Yes, they are. So I'd quite like some of the furloughed people to do some work from home one or two days, but if they do that, they can't be furloughed. The government's just announced tweaks to the furlough scheme. From August, furloughed workers will be able to work part-time. But companies are also going to have to foot some of the bill. Bottom line is, at the moment, you can keep afloat because... At the moment, we can keep afloat because some of us can get here on a bicycle. It's not very sustainable. Yeah. So my question is, how long is it sustainable for? I don't know. Depends when I wear out. From a business that's somehow surviving with only three staff members to one that needs more than a thousand to stay afloat. What happens when your employees don't arrive by bike, but by plane? You can already tell this activity going on. Pick-up truck just starting. I've visited WB Chambers in Kent before. We may be in the countryside, but I'm surrounded by large warehouse-type brick and metal buildings with plenty of noise in this concrete yard. They're churning out produce for supermarket shelves. Hello Tim, we meet again. Hello John. Nice to see you. It's a lovely day. It is, and things are happening in the yard. Yeah, we're keeping on going. We haven't really stopped in terms of amount of work we're doing. It just feels a bit like Sunday every day. As you leave the farm, the roads are quieter, which is really good for getting around, and the shops and pubs are closed. It's like Sunday, endless Sunday. Tim Chambers inherited a 35-acre farm from his father. He now grows a thousand acres of berries spread across different sites in north and west Kent. Over the winter the business imports fruit from southern Europe, Morocco, South Africa and even blueberries from Peru and packs them to meet demand from the supermarkets and us. But the picking season's just about to start here for the main crops, strawberries and raspberries. That's our biggest concern is are we going to get our crops harvested? At the moment it's a bit like the calm before the storm. There's a little bit of harvesting going on, but we're just waiting for the big crop and yields coming through in early June, late May, and that's going to really test whether we can get our people in to harvest the fruit. So how many people have you got working here at the moment? We've got getting on for 700 people at the moment. And coming up? We're going to start picking middle of May with strawberries and raspberries and glass houses. We'll need then to steadily build numbers up to about 1,700 people. So we need about 1,000 people coming in the last two weeks of May, first two weeks of June. More than 95% of Tim's workforce comes from Eastern Europe, from Romania, and particularly from Bulgaria. They stay for the growing season, which now lasts until December, before returning home with their hard-earned wages. You can guess the problem. With travel restrictions and flights grounded, there's a big question over how they're going to get here. This is something farms and production director Sally Hodgoff is concerned about. Now a British citizen, Sally's originally from a village in southern Bulgaria near the Greek border. Have you been talking to people back in Bulgaria? Yeah, constantly, yes. What do they feel? Everybody wants to come. In fact, I would say that there's more people willing to come and I don't see any issues of people willing to come and work for us. They want to come. It's just a question of can they come and can they fly or travel or something, but hopefully it's going to be sorted. And do they not worry about the coronavirus? To be honest, I think most of the younger people and they're quite healthy, I don't think they're worrying as much as the other people. Because they think if they get it, they'll be okay. Exactly. Tim, I have to ask you this about other people. Because they think if they get it, they'll be okay. Exactly. Tim, I have to ask you this about keeping people safe when they come here. A lot of the work being in the fields means that social distancing isn't that difficult. Getting the workers to and from the field is a bit problematic and that we use a lot of buses. We probably have to run double the buses now so that we have spacing within the buses and we disinfect vehicles where the people have been in regularly to make sure that we don't cause a pandemic within our community. So we do have a campsite that we haven't actually opened yet and that would be where people if they are suspected of or do have symptoms of coronavirus, they would go to live in a separate camp for two weeks just to make sure that everything is safe before they come back. As Tim says, these are often family groups who stick together and don't venture much into the wider local community. Their focus is on the work and earning money which, with a favourable exchange rate, will have much more buying power back home in Bulgaria. But what about getting his fruit pickers from the ranks of those who've lost their jobs here in the UK? I looked last night and we had nearly 550 inquiries. Directly to you? Directly to the farm. Yes. That is people resident in the UK. So a lot of that is Eastern Europeans who have been displaced from jobs who were planning to do hospitality work through the summer. So a lot of that is Eastern Europeans who have been displaced from jobs who were planning to do hospitality work through the summer. So a lot of that demand is coming from those people who are now resident in the UK. Probably a smaller number is actually UK born and bred residents. Are they suitable? Are they suitable? Everyone is suitable if they have the right mental attitude. It's kind of mental stamina just to do a fairly repetitive job for eight hours a day. And that's the difference between people who really want to work and actually can work and those who want to pass the time in the sunshine. It's not Darling Buds of May. This is agribusiness. We need to hit picking targets because we have prices that we've set with supermarkets and it all goes back down the chain. It's a cost chain. We have to have people who are hitting 15, 16 kilos an hour picking strawberries, five, six kilos an hour picking raspers. If they don't do that, we're losing money. We're losing money on every person who we employ. So to be here next year, we can't do that. Agri business requires commitment from its workers. Days start as early as 4 a.m. They need to live on the farm, and they need to sign up for around five months at a time. This makes stopgap workers and students unsuitable. But everything is about deadline as well isn't it? I mean this lorry needs to collect at 10 o'clock. If you're not ready by 10 o'clock they can't hit the depots and then it doesn't go to the shops. So if you have to pick 20,000 kilos of rosberries per day you definitely want the people to be dedicated and knowing what they're doing. Otherwise, the whole supply chain is completely missed. It's messed. Service levels get missed and then at the end of season reviews, we lose the orders. On the day we're speaking, flights from Bulgaria are grounded. So how confident is Tim he'll get his fruit pickers in time? There are chartered flights available so a group of farms or individual farms can charter aircraft. So that's extra cost for you? It's about 45,000 pounds, I think, to charter, say, an aircraft that can carry 200, 220, 230 people, so about £200 per person, which is a big cost, but faced with not picking your crop or paying that, then you would pay it. You need to get the people in. We are reasonably optimistic because we know that people want to come to work. We are not so optimistic that the practical ways of them travelling will be there to get them here in time en masse. And with the cancellation of major sporting events like Ascot and Wimbledon, which traditionally give Berry Sales a boost, his profit margins are likely to take a big hit this year. We're actually budgeting to come out of the year at zero. Okay, no profit. No profit. No, no profit. I think we're anticipating that we probably won't be able to harvest all our crop. If I can get out of this year with what I came in on, I think I'll be one of the lucky businesses in the country. So if the worst comes to the worst? We walk away from crops. They'll just rot in the field? Yeah, basically. We've budgeted to walk away from 25% of our crops. We can survive one year walking away from 25%. That is our break-even. That's zero. But your buyers won't be too pleased. The supermarkets won't be pleased. But the show goes on. There will be fruit available from other countries, other places in the world. It won't stop. I'm completely replaceable and not very important in the whole supply chain. Lots of me are put together, but as an individual, the show goes on. It doesn't matter. I can't be sentimental about it. It's business. Tim sounds remarkably matter-of-fact. Undoubtedly, though, this pandemic and the economic lockdown have had a dramatic impact on businesses of all sizes up and down the land. The next hurdle is how the lockdown will be lifted. With social distancing remaining a priority for some time to come, any rapid withdrawal of government support could make life impossible for many of those who have survived this far. Back in South East London, Michael Wren from my local says he does want life to return to normal and pubs to be open again, but not too soon. I don't know where normal to be. We will not be opening as a pub for at least three months, whatever the government saved. It's not right. This is far too soon. I don't know where normal to be. We will not be opening as a pub for at least three months, whatever the government saved. It's not right. This is far too serious. We're far too small. You can't social distance properly. So we will not be opening for a good long time until this thing is properly gone and we'll carry on doing this and we'll carry on doing this after we've opened again. Armed with my four pints, I'll drink to that. Fortunately I didn't order too much because this beer's got me drunk fresh. Something to enjoy over the weekend. Cheers everyone. Filled in business. In Business was presented by me, John Murphy. The producer was Lizzie McNeil. Thanks to Neva Messerian and Rod Farker for mixing the programme. The editor of the series is Penny Murphy. And you can listen to other episodes of In Business on all sorts of topics on BBC Sounds. I'm Winifred Robinson and I'm helping tell the story of what's happening on the COVID wards right now. I'm using recordings made by a doctor with his own colleagues. So we're having these deaths on the ward and then the staff are, I think, going home and crying privately. It's the honest picture of what's going on, of all of the skill involved and also all of the pressures and the fears. To hear more, you can download the NHS Frontline on BBC Sounds."}
