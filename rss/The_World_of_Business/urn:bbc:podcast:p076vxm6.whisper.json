This podcast is supported by advertising outside the UK. BBC Sounds, music, radio, podcasts. Thank you for downloading this podcast. Of course, food is important to all of us. And even Brexit has got people wondering where the UK might get its fresh produce from. I live in Dubai where nearly all of the food is imported, but the government there is making plans to produce more of its food, to grow more of its food, which of course is a huge challenge because it's a mainly desert landscape. So producer John Murphy and I, Georgia Tolly, went on a very sandy road trip to find out more. I've got a very nice orange carrot here and there's two very beautiful camels. Do you want this one? Do you want this one? Oh, look huge teeth. I'm in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates. Naturally, camels have to feature in this program, but not without reason. Oh, I just got a lovely spray of camel's knot. Thank you, but you are very beautiful, so I don't mind. We've got really velvety noses and then slightly bristly chins. So just looking all these beautiful animals, I am completely confident that this species is their species of the future. As a food producing animal, they have so many unique things, feature which we can exploit still. They survive in such a harsh environment. So this species is the species of the future. We won't dwell on the camels right now, but these ones, in the largest camel farm in the world, appropriately named Camelicious, are just one example of the attempts in the United Arab Emirates to use both old and new technology to increase domestic food supply. They even set up a new government department last year, the Ministry for Future Food Security, to inject some energy and to encourage investment into agriculture, in the hope that Emirates will become less dependent on others for food. At the moment, the Emirates imports around 90% of its produce, and much of that is flown in from around the world at great cost. That's basically that's five pounds, eight dollars for a pack of newberries. All the way flown in from Mexico. Then you've got the strawberries here. They're from Egypt. We've got yellow peaches from South Africa. We've got nectarines from Australia. Alfonso mangoes from India. Apparently the Alfonso mangoes were some of the best that the sweetest but you can also get mangoes from Brazil Peru Kenya Wow I hadn't quite realised the extent to which everything's from all around the world got a massive watermelon here that's from Australia I bought I once my first couple of weeks here I bought a melon and it was 12 pounds I spent 12 pounds on a melon I got it home I hadn't really realized the exchange rate because I don't just knew it. Carrots from the States USA peeled carrots can you imagine they're picking the baby carrots peeling them and then sending them on a plane all the way to Dubai no wonder they don't taste in anything Papas Capsican, Holland. It's like the United Nations of veg. So ultimately all this food is imported from all around the world. It's brought in on planes. Huge cost in paying for it to get on the plains and then come into the supermarket. And obviously that cost is transferred onto the consumer. And that's before you've even talked about the sustainability, about the food miles, about the carbon cost. AIMAN COST. An obvious truth about the UAE is that it's a desert region, with a harsh climate reaching 50 degrees Celsius in the summer months. It has little arable land and depends on expensive and environmentally damaging desalination plants to turn seawater into drinking water. This place also has a fast-growing population, and while it has good trading links with the rest of the world, it's located in a politically volatile region. Hence, the focus on food security and an encouraging agriculture, particularly the high-tech variety. Please step into the induction area. Please take a... It's an air shower. Literally it blows any dust pathogens and everything like that off your body. The water is completed. Please live through the back. What are these made out of? These are just polyester protective clothing that make it look like we're scientists, basically. My producer John and I struggle to find Badia farms, mainly because it doesn't look like a farm. In an industrial part of Dubai, you go down an alleyway, past workshops, before spotting the sign on the side of basically a factory building. This is indoor growing in what's called a vertical farm. This is the wow factor. This is designed by a friend of mine in China. It's a mass spectrum. We can grow red lettuce, green lettuce, flowering plants, everything under the same spectrum light. Graham Dunling from Hull in Northern England is a fourth generation grower and the horticultural brains behind this most unexpected of sites. These are the ones that are just going to get packed and harvested today. There's your pea sprouts. Delicious. Why garden peas. John's going in, he's going to eat one. I'm going to eat one now. It's just delicious. And they're clean, aren't they? Yeah, yeah. Well, where's the date? There's no soil involved. So we've got no pathogens, no nematodes, no wheat seeds. We don't need to spray herbicides. We don't use any pesticides whatsoever. So we're in this hangar and there's six growing racks. They're all five levels high. They go way over our head, like twice the height of our head. And they're all growing under these LEDs which put out a sort of beautiful pink, pinky violet light. We're just in this completely sterile environment. We're having to wear our hats and our special gear so that we don't drop any dust. and it's very odd. You're in a sort of factory building. It's completely the opposite to what you'd expect from a farm. We're at 22 degrees inside. I need to ask you. Constantly 22 degrees. Yeah. Even in summer when it's like 50 degrees outside. When it's 55 and 80% humidity, we're 22 and 65% humidity. Our power use is absolutely minimum and we don't use any water for cooling. And in this region, we need to save water. There isn't a scrap of dirt in here. The plants, microherbs and lettuces are grown hydroponically in specially prepared water. We have our own feed recipe for different plants. Okay. So we add all the nitrogen, all the potassium, all the zinc, everything. The company is headed and funded by a Saudi Arabian businessman Omar Al Jundi. He was the one who brought Graham on board. Their first crop came off the production line in December 2017, and now they're selling $55,000 worth a month to restaurants and premium supermarkets. That was the market we went for. We're making a profit. We're paying all the salaries, all the rent, everything. So we are a valuable commercial enterprise. This is just the beginning of a food revolution in the GCC. We are going to replicate this in Kuwait, in Saudi Arabia, in Oman. We're going to do a bigger facility as well. Other companies have planned to set up vertical farms in the Gulf region or the GCC, but so far with far less success. So what are the others getting wrong? Everybody else thinks you just come here, build a greenhouse, sow a seed and it's magic, it works. It doesn't. People are committed to doing things differently. They're buying a car off the shelf, instead of buying a car and redesigning that car to suit things differently. They're buying a car off the shelf instead of buying a car and redesigning that car to suit their environment. They're buying a Ferrari and driving it across the sand. It won't work, it will get stuck. Oh, that's a big bump. So we're driving along a very bumpy road in the middle of the desert. We're not quite sure we're going the right way. And it couldn't get more of a desert landscape if it tried. Just imagine the stereotypical desert you've got reddish orangey sand blowing across the road and you've just got sand dunes on either side and we uh we passed a camel earlier and it's really hard to believe that at the end of this road in all this desert landscape there's going to be a greenhouse full of commercially grown, ripe, juicy tomatoes. What do you reckon, left or right? Straight. Eventually, like a mirage, the buildings of Pure Harvest glint silver in the distance. Sky Kirtz is the co-founder, so we're in the right place. Sky Kirtz is the co-founder and the CEO of Pure Harvest, so we're in the right place. Skykirtz is the co-'m all the CEO of Pure Harvest. Sky Kurtz is the co-founder and the CEO of Pure Harvest. Our tour begins with a quick peek into the packhouse. We're producing about 10 tons a week, which is pretty huge, considering this is only a 6,720 square meter facility, not even one hectare. In the future, we expect to move into at least six to eight times our production capacity here, and we're opening a footprint in Saudi Arabia. And then it's time for the main show, as first one, then a second giant metal shutter door rises slowly. It's like a sort of classic reveal moment in a Hollywood movie. You kind of expect to see aliens on the other side. Here we are in the greenhouse. There's heavy bunches of tomatoes hanging on either side of us. Sky's just given us some tomatoes. It's got one each. These are candy, tomatoes freshly harvested. I stole them right from the bin that'll send these sold. Oh wow. Incredibly sweet. They're really sweet. Oh, they're good. Everyone, you know, there's so much crop here. It's incredible. The greenhouse is really long. That's one row and it's about 94 meters and then it's another 94 meters over there. Oh, wow, yes. So on one side there's little tomatoes, the candy ones, and on the other side are the massive tomatoes, the type that you chop in half and have fried with a breakfast. And then on the floor there's some of the dead leaves that have fallen down. As we prune and pull these leaves to the ground, we leave them there because they become the home for the predator insects. They like to live down there safely. And then they come out only when they wish to feed. Oh, look. Massive bumblebee just came to try and be recorded. There are so many bees. They're buzzing around. Tell me about the bees. Sorry, I'll let you finish your tomato cast. Sorry, I love them too. The bees are flown in from Holland. Believe it or not. They fly them in? They sleep. That's my ear. They're flown in from Holland. Believe it or not. They fly them in? They sleep. That's my ear. They're flown in. They rest, of course, and then once they get here, we wake them up and put them to work. They're indentured service. They fly around and they pollinate. They perform an extremely important function, and there are most important labors pollinating all of the flowers, the millions of flowers that are seen throughout here. Interestingly, after their queen dies, she doesn't have a very long life, they become very, very lazy. They're not very motivated after that, and then they kind of quit working, and that's kind of the end of it. And then we have to... They just stop? They just stop. And then you just fly in another pack? Fly in another pack. The workers? Yeah, yeah. But it's pretty amazing that really nature does a lot of the work, you know, the integrated pest management, the beneficial insects attacking the bad insects, and then the bees doing the pollination. They're really doing a ton of the work for us. The tomatoes are delicious, and the tech is clearly extraordinary, but it must be incredibly expensive. Well, expensive's a very interesting concept. The capital intensity of it is indeed high. However, once you've built this incredible infrastructure, look at the yields. I mean, just look down that row at the incredible output of the tomatoes. We're making anywhere from 10 to 15 times the amount of output per square meter as a traditional farm would. And that quality of that output and the market prices, that output fetches are much higher than a traditional farm. So while the capital cost of building this is very high, the fully absorbed unit cost of production is actually relatively low. And we consume less than 30 liters of water per kilogram of production. A traditional farm here in the UAE consumes over 260 liters of water. Per kilogram of production of very low quality, very seasonal, and often pesticide-filled product, that product that is selling at four dirhams a kilo right on retail is only priced at that because the water is free. The government allows these farms free access to water. That is not sustainable. And now with our groundwater level depleting, it's a national security concern. So expensive is relative. This is a commercial scale proof of concept. The economics of producing this farm at scale are far, far better. Here we go. So here's the soil museum. Which one is first? Sheld. And then? Silt. Silt. In Dubai's Soil Museum, some schoolchildren are learning about the very very small. So again, which one is first? Sand and then? Silt, Silt. In Dubai's Soil Museum, some schoolchildren are learning about the various types of soil in the UAE. You can see there's light red soils, strong red sand, greenish grey sand, grey sand, all the different types of soil that you can find around the UAE. But you'll notice that there's a key word in all of those, sand, not soil. And that is one of course the key problems that the UAE faces. You can't grow if you haven't got soil. And you can't grow if you haven't got desalinated water. And you can't grow if it's too hot. And those are the three major challenges that the UAE is facing when it comes to agriculture, especially in the summer. So in the UAE we have very limited places where we can grow food. Okay, so if you see behind you... I'm Ismahan-Wafi, the Director General of Iqba, that is known to be International Centre for Biosaline Agriculture. But our new logo says Ikba agriculture for tomorrow. Biosaline, there's a lot of salt here, so that's the whole point. Absolutely. It's about growing crops with saline water, anywhere between 20% of the salinity of the sea to 100% of the salinity of the sea. Amongst other things, ICBA is researching crops that can cope with the harsh, salty conditions of the Emirates. As Isma Hayne explained, the overuse of water from underground aquifers by traditional farming has set alarm bells ringing. The data shows that if they don't stop, if they keep the same rate of subtraction of water, they're going to finish their groundwater within 60, 70 years. As a result, there's a focus on new technologies to preserve water, even injecting water into some of those underground aquifers. That's not cheap. But neither are the desalination plants that produce drinking water and nor is the latest agricultural technology. We do talk about hydroponics, but in reality of things, hydroponic right now produce less than 8% of the food produced worldwide. So more than 90% it's still produced on land on soil. So soil it's a huge important component of agriculture worldwide. Although we are going towards more vertical farming, once it's happened at an economical stage then maybe the balance will change. But it has to be under a controlled environment that reduce energy and water because we cannot produce if it's too costly on either oil. But in reality, there's just very little soil to grow plants in. We are in the desert. So realistically, can this country ever grow enough fruit and vegetables to feed itself? Absolutely not. And I think the UAE recognise it. They cannot produce everything the need and maybe they can produce certain species about 30, 40% of their green vegetables, but then there will be always the staple crops which are very important like wheat and rice for the diet of the people here. It would never be useful or even advisable to do the production in the country. You may be able to tell that we're back at Camelicious, the camel farm, where they're breeding the animals for their milk. Oh, that was a baby one. Yeah, they squeak, yes. They squeak. Look, that was a baby one. Yeah. They squeak. Yes. They squeak. Look, this one's trying to stand up. Unlike in normal dairy farming, the baby camels here are kept with their mothers during the lactation period. Chief Fet is Judith Yuhas from Hungary. Originally an expert in horses, she's become a great fan of camels. Camels are so wonderful species. So they were really designed for this harsh environment. I think cameras are happy here. And the camels do get taken for a daily walk, even in peak summer. But what about the economics? Compared to dairy cows, camels reach maturity much later and they produce far less milk. Camel can be a valuable food producing animals. With proper breeding, I really do believe that camel is the species of the future. What's cheaper to farm, cows or camels? Financially, I cannot really answer to this question because there are so many factors. But taking into consideration water resources, the camels definitely use much, much less water. If we select and breed the special breed which produce more milk than the average, then it's definitely advantage on the camel's side. And we shouldn't forget this camel belongs to these people, to the Arabic people, many African people. So it would be really a waste to just forget about these animals as a food-producing animal. So it's definitely camel, camel, camel. So we've got camel milk. I think he's going to bring us some ice cream. And we've got, oh, this is coffee. This is a latte made with camel milk that long life whole camel milk all beautifully packaged in sort of gold and purple packaging endurance drink camelish endurance drink with ginger flavor camel milk honey ginseng guarana Q10 natural caffeine and B vitamin. Over here, oh my gosh. Oh that's shampoo and conditioner. Camel lor. Oh, up here we've got skimmed camel milk powder in sachets. So like when you want to make a coffee in a hotel room. What's this? That is Camelicious growing up formula. That's for babies. Look at that. That's Camelmuck. Who knew you could make so many different products out of camelwilk? These products are selling. Though as far as we could deduce this is not yet a profitable business. But especially with global warming, these animals are certainly better suited to this harsh environment than others. For the moment, the UAE is food secure. Thanks to its wealth and good trading links, it can import most of its food. However, the government is looking to the future, climate change being just one factor it has to consider. The Emirates want to diversify their economy and boost domestic food production, especially through the use of the latest agricultural technology or agtech. We want to become basically a hub for technology when it comes to hot arid regions. You know, it's things like seed technologies, gene editing, biotechnology. Her excellency, Mariam Elmer Hary is the Minister of State at the newly formed Ministry of Future Food Security. She wants to see more food grown in the city. Hopefully, in the near future, we'll see vertical farms, we'll see rooftop farms, we'll see parks that will have an area of food production within it. So these are the things that we're hoping to see in the future. This is an expensive way to farm, isn't it? Yes, it is. But we are also setting up, let's say, the ecosystem to be able to attract businesses to come and invest in food production in the UAE. So there's a lot of facilities now, and they're all adopting technology to grow food. Because going the other way which we've been doing for quite a few years is trying to get the farmers to adopt technology has been really difficult so I'm trying to bring commercial entities bring the knowledge as well in attract the youth and I tell them I want you to be the next agri-technologist. I don't call them farmers. I need to give them a cool name. Attract them to come into that private sector. Get them excited about the new way of growing food. So I'm going at it in a completely different angle. Incongruously located right next to giant cranes lifting containers on and off cargo tankers at the huge Jebel Alley port in Dubai are two large warehouses, the home of a special farm. I'm Nigel Lewis. I'm aquaculture development manager for this company Fish Farm, LLC, and I've been here about three years now. You've had your entire career in fish. Yep. Here they're growing fish in large circular tanks on land using a closed system known as a RAS, a recirculating aquaculture system. And recently they've proudly announced a new arrival to their fish family. So we've got shrimp, sea bream, sea bats, red sea bream, Hamachi, which is Japanese yellow-tailed kingfish for the sushi sashimi market. And we have Atlantic salmon. And that probably is the one which is most demonstrative of what a razz can do. You know, it literally is, and it's a joke that's passed all the time, salmon fishing in the desert. So you're growing Atlantic salmon in the UAE? Yeah, right. It hasn't quite got the romance of the Hollywood movie Salmon Fishing in the Yemen, in which an Arab Sheikh wants to introduce fly fishing for salmon to his homeland. But this is the reality. So this door's got an airlock on us. We're about to enter Scotland. Can I open the door? Yes. Scotland and salmon. It's noticeably colder in here. It's about 15 degrees in here. We chill the air because we're chilling the water because these salmon that are leaping as we speak. They are the Atlantic salmon which came from Scotland as five inches long and now they're three kilos. It's the most extraordinary site and it's a very rare site, isn't it? It's rare for salmon farming to do it on land anyway, even in the traditional areas like Scotland and Norway. They're mostly doing it in caged in the sea. But to be doing it here in the UAE is, well, it started off as a dream, really, a vision to do this in UAE and it's come to fruition now. The finances for this project have come from Dubai's Crown Prince, himself a keen fisherman, Sheikh Hamdan bin Muhammad bin Rashid al-Makhtoun. The enthusiastic business development manager is Edmund Broad. This is the first time that anyone has grown a market size 3 to 4 to 5kG salmon on land ever globally. It's not been done. So we're the first ones to do it. Since 2013 when we started this facility we have not once had to use any antibiotics. It's unheard of for a fish farm. It's capital intensive to start off with. We've turned the corner and made it commercially viable. So this is super high tech and you must be spending an awful lot of money on temperature control. How can you say it's commercially viable? Well quite simply one of the biggest factors for us is that we're not air freighting fish all across the world right so our transport costs are next to nil. What we're growing are really high value high quality fish that command a high price and our operational expense is coming down every year and there's there's enough capacity here for us to be food secure in fish protein by 2020 that's in a year yes the program was produced by john murphy it was mixed by John Murphy. It was mixed by Graham Puddyfoot. The editor of the series is Penny Murphy and I'm George O'Reilly. And I know that as a journalist I'm supposed to be pretty sceptical. But seeing the projects we've seen, the tomatoes, the fish, the camels, it's difficult. They're pioneering and some are succeeding, even if they're still at the development phase. Although they often do rely on wealthy backers, they're not all simply vanity projects. If they can be scaled up, in the future they could boost domestic food production in the UAE. But they still won't feed the masses. With their money and cheap energy, the Emirates can afford to experiment. And yet potential disruptions to trade, dwindling water supplies and the specter of global warming mean food security and high-tech agriculture will become ever more important."}
