This podcast is supported by advertising outside the UK. Welcome to global business on the BBC World Service with me, Josephine Cassidy, from Africa's oldest republic, Liberia. I'm here to investigate the rubber industry, and I'm starting off at the Rally Time Market in the capital, Monrovia. It's a covered market with a corrugated iron roof, which is quite lucky since today is absolutely chucking it down. It's the rainy season, and you can see water pouring down the side of the building. And just to the side of me, there's a store selling household goods, lots of cooking equipment and plates and plastic buckets. And behind it there's someone selling things made of rubber. What about this here is flip-flops, sandals? Slipper is $200. That's Liberian dollars. So in US that's... Like, one US dollar. So they cost about one US dollar for a pair. Do you have any... those black ones in a 39? Yeah. They're nice. So where do they come from? Silver for China. They're from China. But Liberia produces a lot of rubber itself. Yeah, that's true. All economy is a problem because if you produce a rubber here and you don't have any manufacturing company here to turn it into finished goods for the public to make use of it, it's a problem for country and Liberia. The story of Liberia's rubber industry is in many ways the story of the country itself. This is one of the world's poorest countries, yet it's rich in natural resources, such as gold, diamonds, iron ore, and rubber. Rubber makes up 65% of the country's exports and employs more people than any other sector apart from the state. And yet there's no rubber manufacturing based here. There's never been so much as an elastic band made in Liberia. Liberia wasn't always covered in rubber plantations. The industry is less than a century old, and it all started with an Ohio farm boy turned Taya Tycoon on the other side of the Atlantic. Harvey Firestone. With its auto industry booming, the United States was consuming around 70% of the world's rubber. Most of it imported from British colonies in the Far East. Harvey Firestone was determined to find his very own source of rubber. And I urge upon the United States to get relieved by investing in a country under their own control. This can be accomplished in Liberia. Liberia wasn't actually under US control at that time, but the two nations have always been closely intertwined. In 1822, Liberia was founded as an American colony where freed slaves and African Americans could settle. 25 years later, Liberia gained its independence, becoming Africa's first republic. Liberia was ideal. The country was an ally of the United States. It had a large, untapped labor pool and miles and miles of land for planting rubber trees. In 1926, Firestone negotiated a contract with the Liberian government, which would go down in history as the sweetest of sweetheart deals. Liberia gave Firestone the right to lease up to one million acres. That's roughly 10% of the country's arable land. They'd pay only six cents per acre and for an astonishing 99 years. Why on earth did they agree? I asked Liberian economist Samuel P. Jackson. Two reasons. Lack of sophistication and lack of forward thinking on a part of Liberian officials and the objective conditions at the time, Liberia is a very extremely poor country and needed money. Samuel recently wrote a book called Richland Poor Country, which asks why so few Liberians have benefited from the country's abundant resources. The Firestone deal was convenient for the cash-strapped government. When it needed money, Firestone would pay future revenues up front. It began with a $5 million loan. But Firestone sent custom officials to oversee the finances of Liberia. And that really began the domination of Liberia by the American investor interest. So they were overseeing the government's finances? Exactly. They were monitoring and dispensing government revenues. And they did that for a long number of year. And then Liberia couldn't pay. And there was a lot of confrontation between Liberia and Firestone. Firestone went to the White House several times, trying to use Gumbull diplomacy to force Liberia into paying the money. Liberia did eventually pay its debt, and by the late 50s, rubber was booming. The country had the second highest growth rate in the world, beaten only by Japan. But it had little to show for it. Money continued to pour out of the country, like latex pouring out of rubber trees. During the Liberian Civil War, Firestone paid taxes to the rebel leader and former president Charles Taylor, who's now serving a life sentence for war crimes. In return, Taylor's soldiers guarded the plantation to protect Firestone's assets. The company says it did so under threat of violence to protect its employees and property. The industry never quite recovered from the 14-year conflict, and production is still only a quarter of what it was in the 1990s. But since a peace deal was signed in 2003, many Liberians who'd left during the war have returned home, and one of them wants to revolutionize the rubber industry. Law enforcement, survival is based on discipline and attention to detail and focus. I was a correctional officer in California. I was a police officer in California. Meet James Cooper. And don't be fooled by the accent. James is Liberian, although he was a cop in the States for over a decade. I just missed home, seriously. There's something about Liberia. And when you talk to Liberians, or even people that are not Liberians, but have visited here, this country, there's a bug that bites you. James returned home in 2006 and went back to the rubber farm that his parents had owned since 1956. As a kid, this is where we would come on weekends. We would spend holidays and this was like a special place for us. But this is a place that was so serene for me. And so when I moved back home, this was the choice. James is in his 60s now. He's a big guy. It's hardly surprising that he used to be a cop. But he's extremely warm and also very determined as you're here. Do you remember the moment that you first came back to the farm? Yeah, I do. The house here, there was no roof, there were no windows, there was nothing here. There was one toilet and one tub. And trees that were growing out of the house. James found that the rubber trees had been slaughter-tapped during the war. They'd been frantically and carelessly harvested until they could no longer produce rubber. But that wasn't all. When I came back home, there were 17 ex-combatants that had taken over here and were living here. And had I not had the law enforcement background, I may have been hesitant to come out. I'm sure I would have. Because one of the things that being in law enforcement teaches you is that there's a lot to do with how you treat people as to how they treat you. And so did you form relationships with those combatants, the rebels who were in their house? We did. we did, actually. And it was so interesting because they had this thing all written up. They said, here we want to hear the rules of Cooper Farm. First of all, no loud music after a certain time. And then number two, you know, no chasing somebody else's wife. And then number three, no use of drugs. Number four, no violence. I mean, they had a whole list of things that was important to them in terms of building community. And so we used their rules to establish a new framework for living here. Many of them became part of the workforce on the farm. And with their help, James began replanting his rubber trees. I had to cut all the trees down throughout the 400 acres, buy sections and do the replanting. This year, we will be harvesting our first portion of 10,000 trees. So it's your first harvest? How are you feeling? You must be quite excited. Very much so, very much so. James is taking us on a tour of the farm. A man with aviator sunglasses and combat pants is hanging on to the side of the 4x4. James tells me he's increasingly worried about crime in Liberia's struggling economy, and so he moves around with this guy, his security guard. You'll have to cling on quite tightly because we're going down quite a bumpy road. We are way back away from the city if you will, but we are in the jungle. You see a lot of bamboo here. And what we're going now is in the area where we started the new farm. Just hold on, hold on, hold on. The Jeep's got stuck, so just trying to get it out of the dish So we're just waiting across this stream It's not running too fast at least Quite an epic journey just to see a tree but with the jeep stuck in the mud this is our only option as i walk you walk every small the place slippery this is really africa you see right here right here you are okay. That for you, you're underground. Back on dry land, we continue, hacking our way through the undergrowth. Suddenly there's loads of trees. They're all planted in lines. Oh, wow. I meet John Morris. He's responsible for the replanting. Some are ready now to be operating now, to tap. They're already ready to produce rubber. Yeah, that's his first one. Okay, so there's this tree in front of us. It's got this cut down the side of the bark. Sort of looks like a scar, like a wound. And there's a white liquid that looks like milk, a creamy liquid, oozing out of it. And this is the little that... The latex. Yeah, the latex. And then it drips down a creamy liquid, oozing out of it. And this is the little that... The latex. Yeah, leitistak. And then it drips down. And then there's a piece of metal. Pardon me? Like a spout that takes it. Yeah. And then the letter begins to flow. It's very beautiful, isn't it? It looks, it's like mottled, kind of white colours. It looks like it's almost got a khaki pattern on it. Yeah. So how much rubber does one tree produce? Some give two cup of this every day. So how much rubber does one tree produce? Some give two cups of this every day. So they give two litres a day, this is a little one-liter black car. On the way back through the jungle, John and his colleagues break into song. They tell me rubber tapas have sung this for generations. They're going to make a catammer. At first, James intended to sell this raw latex to Firestone, as his parents had. But two years ago, he visited Sri Lanka on a business trip, and his perspective completely changed. They have an established rubber manufacturing industry that provides rubber-made goods not only domestically, but they export manufactured rubber products to India and other countries, where they receive the highest return on their investment on the value chain. And we do just the opposite. Sri Lanka and Liberia produce roughly the same amount of rubber each year, but the Sri Lankans direct 88% of it into manufacturing their own rubber products, whereas Liberia just exports the raw material. The result is that Sri Lanka earns over six times more from its rubber industry than Liberia does. We have rubber mats, flip-lops, rubber boots, we have some tires. We have rubber hoses, gloves, ceiling tiles, and there are close to 500 rubber products that we could be manufacturing in country. Could be, but these are only prototypes. They're being shown to me by James Cooper Jr., James's son. He's been working with his dad since he was 14. What we are planning to do is to pilot manufacturing of finished rubber products throughout Liberia to show that it is a viable option for Liberians who want to get into processing and then further value addition to supply. The Cooper's managed to find a Sri Lankan investor and they've already begun processing. The latex is poured into troughs and heated until the water evaporates and the rubber becomes solid. He's putting their rubber through the machine. He's pulling it out. It's getting flatter. It's kind of crackling as it goes through. It smells a bit of burning, well, of burning rubber. So what was a little square is becoming a much bigger sheet. Yeah, it looks like a pancake and it's, yeah, it's warm from the machine and it sort of sticks together. The Cooper rubber plant is the only Liberian-owned business doing this processing. Other producers just take vats of liquid latex to Firestone and other multinationals who process it themselves and then export it to manufacturing plants. Of rubber and then we go into the factory. Trouble is, this big factory that James is showing me around, is eerily empty. The bales of rubber are collecting dust, and they only run the machines from time to time to stop them rusting in the rain. In the last nine months, James has had to lay off 140 people. He's brought some of them to meet us in his office. He wants to show us what an impact the business made in this region. So for now, there is no business going on. It's difficult for us. I meet Rosetta Whist her. She was the business manager here until she lost her job. That must be really hard. How are you managing for money? No, I guess, as you say, it's very high, doing nothing. It's very, very tedious. And with the economy we have, we try a different era for a job, but everywhere we go that the economy is bad, so there is no job. And do you receive any money from the government when you haven't got a job? No, not at all. So how are you surviving? Did you have savings? Yeah, when I was, yeah, I was like a savings. So I'm using that to do small and petty business so I can be able to sustain myself. What business are you doing? Well, I do use clothes. Use clothes, like sell use clothes? Yeah, in the market. Yeah, in the market. Yeah, in the market. She's also struggling with rising prices. Inflation here is at 30%. How do you cope at home with prices rising? Well, it's difficult. It's really, really difficult. It's really difficult. School fees and I increase. How much has it gone up by? And it's gone up to $146. $146. $146 for a year? Yeah, no pay semester. And how much was it gone up by? They've gone up to $146. $146 for a year. Yeah, no pay semester. And how much was it before? It was like close to $90. We're in Bommey County, the poorest part of a poor country. If you're earning here, you'll likely have dozens of extended family members depending on you. Do you have any relatives who work at the farm? I can say yes, they might not be directly my relative to... Extended family. Yeah, extended family members depending on you. Do you have any relatives who work at the farm? I can say yes, they might not be directly my relative. Extended family. Yeah, extended family that were working on the farm. Anita Vincent is 22. She lives in the area and is studying to be a nurse, but she's struggling to pay her tuition fees. At least before I could go to those extended relatives to all. But now if I'm here a ask, they will say, you see, I'm not working now. I was working on the copper fire and earning something. For now, I'm not working, so I can help you. So it is very pitiful. It is very sorrowful. And Anita says that as poverty is worsening, more are turning to crime. Even when you wash your clothes, you hang it up, you're getting someone to come and take it from behind. You don't go sell it. When you wash your clothes, you hang it up, you get someone to come and take it from behind you. People just steal the clothes from the washing line. When local businesses close here, every family is affected. It's challenging times for the industry. The price of rubber on the world market has been falling for years. But that's not the reason why James Cooper has had to shut up shop. Last June, James had very nearly secured a multi-million dollar investment for his move into manufacturing. It would have allowed him to employ 200 more people. But then he ran into trouble with a high-level politician. A row erupted in the local press and it escalated until James was taken to court on charges of terroristic threat and criminal malevolence. James was initially convicted, but he appealed the charges successfully and eventually his name was cleared. But he says his foreign investor got cold feet about putting money into such a politically volatile environment. James needed the money to consolidate existing debts. And without it, operations ground to a halt. And there's a lot of noise around here, reflecting instability. There's a lot of noise on the political end. If that death bill doesn't reduce, La Bureau will be facing some serious challenges now and in the future. Economist Samuel P. Jackson says that Liberia's political instability and widespread corruption is off-putting for investors. Okay, so we have to minimize corruption, make less laws that are negatively impact businesses, and to give some sort of confidence for their traction of private finance capital because private finance capital doesn't like instability. And Liberia's economy is already facing multiple challenges. The budget is suffering today because of several reasons, but prime among them is the reduction in the price for Robert and I and all. That's due to overproduction in Southeast Asia and the slowdown in China. The withdrawal of UN peacekeeping troops has also had an impact on the economy. We have 17,000 troops here. There was a lot of consumption associated with that. There was a lot of spending. So the hotels, the restaurants, the bars, the dry cleaners and other services. Former Liberian president, a Nobel Peace Prize winner, Ellen Sirleaf, is revered by much of the international community. But... What the government of Ellen Solif did not do is did not prepare the economy for the eventual withdrawal of the peacekeeping forces and UN-related activities. And that is undermining macroeconomic stability today. You have lower taxes, lower revenues, you have a serious problem in terms of budget gaps, and you have serious problems in terms of funding for social infrastructure. All of this, combined with the Ebola outbreak in 2014, which left thousands dead, has sent Liberia's economy into free fall. Inflation is dangerously high and food prices are soaring. But even if the current crisis is brought under control, the economy needs to change fundamentally, says Samuel. Liberia needs to diversify its output. Manufacturing is only 11% of GDP. Liberia needs to do more to diversify its economy in terms of tourism, hospitality industry, manufacturing, agro-processing, value addition, and all of those. And if it continues just to rely upon firestone in the concessions, it will all be held hostage to its past. We are in a plantation as you see on our right and on our left new rubber trees. At the moment they just look like sticks coming out of the ground with a few leaves on them. Yes, yes. Because they're just like a year old. It's really beautiful. It's very green and lush and you can see the hills in the background. And we went through a little checkpoint on the way in here. What did they say? They were reminding us of our speed limits. That is a concession area. We're in the Firestone concession at Harbell. It's like a country within a country. The plantation is the size of Singapore. So we're just driving down a little street with houses on either side. They're made of red brick and they look very neat and tidy. There's hedges out the front with some nice orange flowers on them, satellite dishes next to the houses. It's a much higher standard of housing than we've seen in most places in Monrovia. There's some women sitting underneath the trees here, selling drinks and snacks, and it all feels very serene and very peaceful. But under the surface, this is a troubled place. Because the rubber price is falling on the world market, Firestone is suffering and wants to cut its workforce here by 13%. Already, over 700 people have been laid off. I'm off to meet the president of the trade union. I am Redenek in Bengali. I'm the president for the firestorm cultural workers, you know, like Deweer. I serve over 4,000 workers. Redenek is a lively man in a leather jacket whose phone never stops ringing. He really has his hands full at the moment. Are people worried about losing their jobs? Is there a fear that they could be next? There are fear among people that anything I can go. The way firestone is laying up people. Manek will appear on the list tomorrow. And if you're given a month's notice to leave and pack up your whole life, move your kids' school. It's tough. It's a issue that people can hardly comprehend. They can even get over it, how it happened. Because the first thing they start thinking, where are they going? People here are protected from the harsh reality of life outside this bubble. You work here, they give you housing, you got your children going to school, when you are sick, you go to hospital. If you go out, all of those amenities are taken away. You don't have it. In 2008, the then-President Ellen Surleaf put pressure on Firestone to provide free education, free medical care, and higher quality housing for their employees. Wages here a 67 US cents an hour. It might not sound like much, but in a country where two-thirds of the population live on less than $2 a day, it's worth sticking around for. You have to start adjusting yourself to live in another environment. So it's a difficult thing for our people. It's almost like a frustration on the people. A big disappointment. There are some people now who have no means, absolutely no mean to even survive. Do you think that business is going to pick up again for Firestone in Liberia, or is this the beginning of a decline? Business will resume as it used to be or even more than that. If it were not going to be so, they would have taken the initiative to start replanting. They are now replanting. Business will improve. Because of that, we still hopeful. James is trying to get back on his feet and he's in negotiations with investors in Liberia and abroad, who could support him to expand into manufacturing. But for now, it's a waiting game. Do you ever have moments where you think, I wish I never got myself into this? You know, again, I go back to my faith. I have moments where I get tired or that I feel wow, you know, but I have always, I've loved, this is my heritage. I mean, this is where I was born. And one of the things that for me is so important, my parents always taught me if you're not making a positive difference in this world, you're just taking up space on the planet. And I know for a fact that whatever little difference I can make or we can make, it is significant here in Liberia compared to any other country. You know, it's kind of like the difference between dropping a pebble in the ocean and dropping a pebble in a pond. And so it's immediate, you see the impact right there today.
