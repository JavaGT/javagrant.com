This podcast is supported by advertising outside the UK. This is the BBC's world of business. I'm Leslie Kerwin, and the producer is Rosamond Jones. This week we're exploring the gender pay gap. Why is work done mainly by women valued less than work done by men? And we're asking if there are ways to fix the unfairness. In almost every country on earth, men's wages are higher than women's, sometimes by as much as 35%. Why? Partly because some men are being paid more than women for doing the same job. But mostly it's because work that's mainly done by women, such as cleaning, clerical or caring work, gets paid less than jobs mainly done by men. And this is still happening, despite laws in many countries which make it illegal. In this program, I want to explore why having a lot of people, despite laws in many countries which make it illegal. In this program, I want to explore why having an equal pay law is often not enough. So I'm looking at a radical experiment in Iceland, a place often judged to be the most gender equal economy in the world. I'm standing in a square in the centre of Reykjavig. I'm here with Mariana Trostodokhter. And Mariana, we're standing here right in the center of government, really. Tell us about some of the buildings around here. Well, we are standing right in front of the Prime Minister Office. Then we have Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank. And here we started the Women's Strike in 1975, right where we are standing. That's where we had the first one. And in this place, since then, every few years, you've had women's strikes with the focus on pay. Yes. As we look at the central bank building, you see this big black house, it was under construction in 1985, and we took over one floor and we demonstrated for one week different occupations that women were doing. And we were asking politicians and the labor leaders to take care of elderly, to make beds and clean and do the work that women were doing, low paid so they could find it on their own skin how difficult it was. Women fighting for equal pay have been backed by the unions. 85% of the workforce are in one and that strengthened the pay strikes. Last year, how many people did you have around this central area of recoupic? Roughly 30,000. We were very quite pleased last year. We are seeing more and more men coming to demonstrate with us. So that's about a quarter of the working population actually came here. Yes. They just walked out of work. Yes. The employers accepted. Yes, they do walked out of work. Yes. Employers accepted. Yes, they do. How do people react to these strikes? Generally, do they applaud them or do they think, why is that going on? What are they doing out there? Oh, they applaud them. This passion for equality was the background for new regulation, which came into force in January 2018. The Equal Pay Standard means that all organisations employing 25 people or more must establish equal pay rankings for work of equal value and get their employees' actual pay checked by auditors. You have to rank all jobs to find out which jobs are of equal value. This is Driva Sigurotter, a consultant who's helped to prepare Icelandic businesses for the change. Companies have to prove that they offer equal pay-for work of equal value. They have to prove it. You find an auditor to certify that you have done what the Equal Management Standard tells you to do. Crucially, if companies don't comply, there are consequences. If you don't implement the standard, then you run the risk of getting a fine. $300 a day. And for smaller companies, it's a great deal of money. So for big companies, it wouldn't be quite such a big deal. No. But no company wants to be on the list and got a fine deal of money. So for big companies, it wouldn't be quite such a big deal. No. But no company wants to be on the list and got a fine because of equal pay. One company that has already complied with the equal pay standard is one of the country's oldest, Olga Din. Julius, hi. I'm Leslie Cohen from the BBC. Welcome. Julius Christianson is the Human Resources Director. The company started 100 years ago as a brewer and now manufactures food, alcohol and soft drinks. You've got a drinks dispenser here which has apples in. What is that? It's been the same recipe since 1955, and this drink is in the heart of each and every Icelander I think so you want to try yeah and okay so looks orange and fizzy but that's not as sweet as most orange drinks Olgadin employs about 400 people. About 73% are men, 27% female. And given those figures, are there some jobs that are almost exclusively male and some almost exclusively female? Yes, in the manufacturing area, almost every employee man. That is not by our choice. It just happens like that. And what do the women do? The accounting and the office jobs, there are higher percentage of women. In order to comply with the new regulation, first they had to evaluate what everyone here did. We looked at each job and we ranked them on eight criteria. And what were the criteria? Their education, experience, initiative, nature and area of impact, responsibility, management, how easily it is for us to replace that position and mental stress. Mental stress? Right. So when you've done this exercise, what kind of jobs emerged as being equal value? To give you an example, we have a canteen worker, a warehouse worker and the manufacturing worker all ranked at the same value of job. So the canteen workers would be mostly female, wouldn't they? Yes, that's right. Manufacturing workers are mostly men. And so since this exercise, they would get paid pretty much the same amount? Yeah, that's right. There is nothing new about job evaluations. But in Iceland, they're trying to ensure that they're done, wearing what are frequently referred to here, as gender glasses. We all have some hidden biases. That's Driver Sigurdardt Dottir again. When you look at male-dominated jobs, they tend to be evaluated higher when it comes to complexity of tasks. Typical janitors, male, receptionist, female. Usually the janitor is paid higher than the receptionist. They probably both have similar education. The complexity of task in that job is similar. The receptionist has to answer several calls. Maybe there is somebody who's standing in front of the receptionist, the phone is ringing, she has to multitask. But somehow we think that it's more difficult to be a janitor than a receptionist. And that's the kind of underlying assumption that is being seriously challenged here. Companies must take a fresh and radical look at job roles. You're more likely to find the guys selling to other companies, where female are selling to individuals. And selling to companies is valued more than selling to individuals. So you have to ask the question, is that just because we think it's of more value or is it of more value? Surely it is possibly more difficult, isn't it, to sell from one business to another than it is just to sell to the general public? Haven't they got a point? Of course. It can be more complex in a way. But just assuming that it is of greater value is something that companies in Iceland is not possible. So you have to clarify why. You have to explain it to the external auditor. In a way, you are completely rethinking the value of different parts of the organisation. Yeah, we are. This is potentially revolutionary stuff taken across a whole economy. But at Ulgadin, the changes are not on a big scale. Five employees, mostly women, got their pay increased this year. And six employees were assessed as overpaid, a trickier problem. What happened to them? In these cases, we just stop increasing the salaries or slow them down, so by time the gap will decrease. So how did the people concerned, and I'm assuming most of them were men, how did they feel about that because they were being disadvantaged? Well, were they disadvantaged? That's the question. We spotted those who were overpaid for the job. And how did they react to it? I don't think they were very happy, but I think they understand it. Every employee here wants to have equality. And I think employees do talk about their salary. Do they? Yeah, they do. My name is Karen. I'm actually a food scientist. We are five in that department here. Within that group of people, do you talk freely about pay? Sure. We actually were just talking about it this summer because the mail that is going to take over for me while I'm on my maternity leave, he was asking, like, what would be normal? And you told him? Yeah. Amela? Do you talk about pay? I do, because I want to know. Everything is equal, and so I just ask people, they told me. The auditors visited Ogadin in January this year, and the process was rigorous. Everything is inspected. For example, how a salary decision is made. There are some pay rises that is checked. Why is that person raised? And what are the arguments for that? Did they talk to you about it in detail? Yes, I have to answer really many questions thoroughly. And what is the gender pay gap here now? It's about 1% or less on average. You're looking at Mountesia, which is Reykiewicz Mountain and the bay out here is Faxafloibay. Breath-taking views from the windows of the TV company Saga Film. Hilmer Sigurdsen is its chief executive. And across from there, you can see the mountains of Snafisnes Peninsula, where Snafisnes-Yukitl, the glacier is. The company makes short films, TV documentaries and dramas, and I was given a peek into one of the wardrobe rooms. This is from our last production. So you've got a lot of clothes in there, which are labelled, presumably, for different characters. Yes. And we go into the editing part. Oh, Dane. Hi. Hi. This is an online suite. the editing part. Good day. Call Diane. Hi. Hi. This is an online suite we have. The company has 23 permanent employees, and because of its size, it does not have to comply with the equal pay standard. But it's chosen to do so anyway. As a result, it can now advertise a pay gap it's proud of. It's three and a half percent. Do you think you can get it down more? We will get there, yes. My name is Tina Johanstottir, and I'm executive producer non-scripted. How long have you been working here? I've been here for seven years. So do you know anybody in the company whose pay went up because of the standard? Yes. My pay. Your pay went up. I agreed to take on a different role within the company. And when we sat down to discuss that role, I was actually informed how much is paid for that role. Was the equal pay standard mentioned? Yes. It was due to both my exchanging of jobs and also due to this process we were going through. It has... Sorry, my tongue is like... It boosted it, yes. Tina was one of only two employees whose pay was raised by the exercise. And preparing the company for the audit took up weeks of management time. Took more time than I hadn't anticipated. There's ever been a moment where you thought, oh, I really could do without this? The politically correct answer is no, but yes, these thoughts have come up. In Iceland, the full financial cost of the regulation, including the annual audit, falls on employers. The cost of going through this process for his time was about 5 million Icelandicroner, which is about 40,000 US. That's a reasonable amount of money, isn't it? For a company, RSI, it's something that takes a bite. Despite this, Hilma Sigurdsen thinks it was worth it. The exercise helped him to put on his gender glasses across the company's operations, even ensuring that more dramas have female lead characters. And Saga Film has also taken a new approach to the 1,200 or so freelance work as it hires every year, such as camera crew and TV producers. We particularly look out for trying to get like a gender balance in our productions. So in our most recent shoot, we actually had more females than male in the crew. How much effort did it take to get a more equal balance? You have to be persistent, put it that way. A company like ours throughout the years, we get to work with same people again and again. They sort of probably expect to be with us on a next job. So when they get told that, sorry, we have to prioritize, gender on this one, therefore you're not going to be with us on this production. They obviously don't like it, but they accept it and learn to live with it. Iceland's new regulatory system is very unusual. It forces companies to assess equal pay for equal work, and it fines them if they don't obey the rules. France and Spain are also planning pay monitoring systems for larger companies, with penalties attached. There is another alternative to fight through the courts, but that's far from easy. I've come to Glasgow because it's here that we've seen something really rare happen in the UK. Despite decades of having a law intended to ensure equal pay for work of equal value, this is one of the few places where that law has actually been used to get better wages for jobs done mainly by women. Following landmark judgments from Scottish courts in 2017, Glasgow City Council has paid out about $710 million in back pay to around 14,000 female employees. A few kilometres from the city centre in a quiet residential street, I met up with two of them. Hello, Frances. Hi, I'm Leslie. How are you? Good'm good, thank you. I met Liz Stoney and Frances Stoyokovic in Francis's neat house recently done up. They could not tell me exactly how much money they've received. That's because all the claimants have had to sign agreements to keep that secret or lose their payout. But what they've got in the last few months has already made a huge difference to their lives. I don't do overtime anymore. You've got a broad smile on you, you folks? Yes. Right. Yeah. Don't have to think, oh, how many hours overtime I'm going to do this month? Just to make that wee bit up. Yeah. It's made me get my kitchen that I've always wanted, give my family some money, helped out my daughter, get her house done, and just have a wee bit of security. But it has taken a very long time to get to this point. Oh, I didn't think it was going to take over 12 years, thought it might have been a couple of years, it was like a rollercoaster, it was very stressful because one minute you think, okay, we're getting somewhere, we're going to get our money, we're going to be treated equal. And then it was like a roller coaster. It was very stressful because one minute you think, okay, we're getting somewhere, we're going to get our money, we're going to be treated equal. And then it was like, bang, something else had happened. And it was going back to court, back and forward. And it's just been going on and on and on. So, Liz, what were you doing 12 years ago when this whole thing started? I was a catering assistant in a primary school. Back then, Francis worked as a home carer looking after people who were terminally ill. We looked after them until they'd passed away. So it was a really hard job. Very hard job, very emotional upsetting, yeah. For their families as well, because you've got to deal with them as well. And it's just, it's sad, sad, sad. The no-win-no-fee legal firm that represented Francis and Liz was Action for Equality Scotland. It represented more than half of the 14,000 women who've won settlements from the council. It's led by Stefan Cross QC. One of the judges called me the man that launched a thousand writs. That's because for over 30 years, he's been involved in many equal pay cases brought against local authorities. And he has very personal reasons for taking that work on. My mother did these jobs. Oh, my mother was a home carer. She was a cleaner, admin. She started as a secretary. All these classic female jobs. My mum's done them all. The injustice has been staring me in the face for 30 years, and I've been determined to fight it. He's not alone. Other law firms and trade unions have represented claimants in cases like Glasgow. In recent decades, it's estimated that about 250,000 women have received around $3.8 billion in back pay through legal action. Stefan Cross warns, even when these cases are won, it's a long, bitter road. The most difficult thing is right at the beginning, actually getting the pay information and getting an explanation from the employers as to why there's any difference. Because you need to try and evaluate whether or not the employers are actually giving you a good reason. And the employers fight tooth and nail to try and defeat these cases. If you look at the big cases and they've taken years and years and years, you have just got to have enormous funds and enormous commitment to be able to pursue it through the system. The reason, he says, why women were paid less than men doing equivalent jobs at Glasgow City Council goes back to 2006. A new grading system was brought in, but it was realised that men's wages would be eroded. So the male-dominated jobs were protected with supplementary payments. Glasgow had more than 120 of these schemes. What kind of jobs did the men have that brought bonuses? Oh, they would be ranging from street sweeping through to skilled-based staff, joiners and electricians. And I mean, there were so many different types of jobs. It was unbelievable. Without pay transparency, many women did not know that while they were working at the same grades as many men, they were not receiving the same pay. Some were earning four US dollars an hour less than males in comparable jobs. Liz and Francis finally learned of that fact at a meeting organised early on by Action for Equality Scotland. We were getting paid wrong. We were getting paid a lot more or less than there were milking preparators. I didn't have a clue until it was exposed. And what did you feel when you realised this had been going on presumably for quite a while? Angry, very angry. We were getting robbed. In the vast majority cases, women don't know what their comparators get paid and have no real way of finding out. And getting support, even if you find out the information, is incredibly difficult because there's no external body who's properly enforcing the legislation. So it just carries on being a secret problem, really. And also angry at the unions for letting it go all those years and now they're different but back then weren't interested in us. Are you talking about them as though they're mostly male? Yes, yes. Do you think that mattered? Yep, I did, yeah. By the time of the court judgments in 2017 the unions were fully on board and supported the women when they lost patience with the slow progress of getting their back pay. So in October 2018, a two-day mass strike took place in Glasgow. Thousands of women and some male colleagues took to the streets today after 12 years of arguing about equal pace. Primary schools and nurseries across the city are closed and most home care services suspended. Glasgow City Council say that's... How can you love going strike? But I really shouldn't say this, but I loved it. As if we were taking back some power from them. And the people in the street were great. Be people buying tea and coffee and shaking our hands outside the nursery school, which was good. Because at first we'd have thought, oh, how are we going to react to this? Because people can't get their kids into their nursery. And the parents were great. They were like with you all the way. The law can be made for the money, when do we want it now? The law can be made to work. But Francis Stoyakovich, like thousands of others, would rather have been paid the right money for the job from the start. We should not have to fight in courts for what is right levers and what we are due. We should be given a decent wage. We shouldn't have to go to court to fight to get a decent living. Iceland's got a law which forces employers to evaluate jobs and to pay the same for jobs of equal value. If they don't do it, these employers can get fined. Do you think that could work here? That's a great thing to do. That would be amazing. We've got that here, definitely. But even some Icelanders don't think this country holds all the answers. We won't know until the end of this year how many companies have got through their equal pay audits successfully, and if any of them will be fined. The early adopters, the ones we've heard from in this program, are most likely to be companies with a keen commitment to equality. And not all Icelandic companies fit that bill. There are even concerns that there won't be enough inspectors. And that's not all. We have very many companies who don't have 24 or more employees, So it doesn't cover the entire labour market in Iceland. Driba Snaidel is the first female president of the Icelandic Confederation of Labour, whose trade unions represent 60% of workers. She pointed out that the impact of the equal pay standard is as yet unknown. So it will be very interesting to see if it has had the effect that it will hopefully have. Has there been any improvement in the pay gap because of the new law? That is yet to be seen. You have to interview me again in a couple of years. This is not the perfect solution. Because it measured job with job within the company. You don't measure company with company. So let's get this right. If you only compare pay within companies, not between companies, she is clear that the economy-wide problem of women's low wages will not be solved. As many other countries, we are very gender-segregated. The women are in care jobs, teachers, nurses, men are engineers, electricians, etc. So this is not the big solution country-. You know, you've been a bit skeptical about this legislation talking to me, but I get a sense that it's going to be easier here to make changes than it would be in a lot of other economies. Yes, I think we are closer than most places. But what I am so afraid of will happen is that we will stop fighting because we are always on top of every list of equality in the world. And it just shows the status of gender equality in the world that we are on the top of the list with so long to go yet. Iceland is embarking on a bold experiment, which other bigger economies could copy. But if countries with a big and stubborn pay gap decide to follow this lead, they will face a dilemma. Either to accept the cost of equalising the pay of jobs done mainly by men, with those done by women, which will be measured in many, many billions, or for men to actually be paid less. Neither of those options will be ones politicians or businesses are ever likely to choose. If you enjoyed listening, you can discover more music, radio and podcasts on BBC Sounds."}
