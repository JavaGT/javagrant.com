This podcast is supported by advertising outside the UK. This is the BBC's World of Business. I'm Alex Kretowski and the producer is Rosman Jones. This is the final download edition in the Global Business series on the world's media industry from the BBC World Service. Welcome to Global Business on the BBC World Service. I'm Alex Kratowski, and this is the last in our series on the state of the media around the world. Previous programs have looked at how U.S. President Trump has provoked a fierce debate about trust and fake news. We've also looked at the effect ownership has on journalistic freedom and impartiality. And this week, I am looking at how new technologies may affect how We've also looked at the effect ownership has on journalistic freedom and impartiality. And this week, I am looking at how new technologies may affect how we consume media and what impact that, in turn, could have on the sort of media we end up with. I'm talking to you from my apartment in the U.S. city of Los Angeles, where I live with my family, countless robots, and all the voice-activated devices that you could possibly imagine. Turn the living room lights on, please. Okay. The program's producer, Roz, is based in London, and between us, we'll be speaking with people who are finding new ways to interact with audiences, new ways to personalize what we consume, and new ways to engage and surprise us. My interest in this area comes not just as a journalist and social researcher, but also by looking at my ever-increasing collection of domestic robots. One of the newest recruits is the Amazon Alexa, a digital assistant built into a smart speaker. Alexa, what's the news? Here's your flash briefing in BBC News from Tune-in. This is the BBC News. Hello, I'm John. Alexa will give me news from sources I request, but it will also show me headlines on its screen, and I don't know the providence of them. What I do know is that in 2013, Amazon's founder and CEO, Jeff Bezos, bought The Washington Post, and I wanted to know if there was any link between those two. I got in touch with Jeremy Gilbert, the Post's director of strategic initiatives. At one point, those headlines were coming from the Post, not exclusively. So the Associated Press was involved in a couple of other news organizations. It may still be true that the Post is sending some headlines. I don't know. I haven't been involved in that in a while. Jeremy's job is to figure out how new technologies can support the newsroom in general. A big part of that role recently has been exploring what is possible with artificial intelligence. In the U.S., several news organizations are using an artificially intelligent system to create some of their output, and the Washington Post is a leader in this space. And unsurprisingly, owner Bezos has brought with him the same attitude to automation that he originally brought to bookselling. Algorithms have entered the newsroom. But artificial intelligence has not replaced people like me yet. Journalists use AI as a way to generate lots of articles based on the templates that they themselves write. And this is meant that they can get really detailed in their coverage. Jeff Bezos had really pushed the post to be as national and international an organization. So when we started talking in 2015 about how we were going to cover the 2016 elections, one of the first things I said is we need to cover more. Historically, we'd only cover 10 to 15% of all the races, and I thought we needed to be more comprehensive. And so politics, not totally surprisingly, because it's the Washington Post, was the way that we got into this. Which areas are no-goes at the moment? I am not at all interested in weighing into opinion areas. We need to be very careful that we're telling you what happened, rather than try to do the why it happened. I'm leery of machines trying to do that for fear that they will persuade people, that there are reasons that something happened that just are not true. And so with the way paved, the AI at the Post has been allowed to cover all kinds of areas that don't require opinion. But that doesn't mean that AI might not get things wrong. An algorithm is only as accurate as the person who created it. So, for example, in 2017, the Los Angeles Times as robojournalist reported that a severe earthquake had hit the coast that day when the earthquake had actually occurred in 1925. I asked Jeremy Gilbert how you avoid those sorts of errors. We can check very, very rigorously before we publish anything. You don't have to make the machine go live until you're really sure that it can work. That said, sometimes things are going to slip through, which is, I think, one of the real dangers in a system that's AI powered, is that if you do make a mistake, you might not be just making it one time. You might be making it in a whole bunch of places. This isn't just happening in the U.S. though. Human robojournalism has arrived in the UK, too. Radar, which stands for robots and data and reporters, is a news agency based in London that specializes in providing hyper-local content to hyper-local audiences around the UK, both online and in print. Like The Washington Post, radar mines national data sets so that statistics about health outcomes, for example, can be broken down to provide stories about particular towns or even particular hospitals. This local data then gets dropped into a template containing relevant phrases that are written by journalists. When we were piloting our project and trying to understand how we would use our technology, we found that when errors were being made, it wasn't to understand how we would use our technology. We found that when errors were being made, it wasn't that there was a problem with the software. The errors were being made through simple human error in data handling. We've transposed a set of numbers into the wrong column. This is Gary Rogers, the editor-in-chief. He says that using computer algorithms to help create local news means that more editorial oversight is required, not less. Where we check is moving around a little bit. It's not just the final sub who checks the copy. There's some checks that have to be put in in the input side of it for what we're asking the machine to do to help us produce the copy. Gary Rogers believes the demand for AI-assisted local journalism is high. The local news industry is, how should I put this, financially stressed right across the globe? Publishers are finding it hard to keep the same numbers of reporters in their newsrooms doing the same job. What types of stories are you writing? A whole range of topics that are probably the main beats of any newsroom you'd walk into. Crimes an obvious one. Police published crime figures. But education boards and education authorities publish lots of schools data and university data about results and about performance. And then there's transport metrics. And there's environmental measures. So we've been in full production mode since the beginning of June. And I think we've published 50,000 individual stories. That's worth reiterating. 50,000 local stories for an audience that struggled to get the detailed news it wanted. All created in just six months by five human journalists, and of course, the algorithm too. So it's certainly proving productive, and despite its early hiccups, I think it's a promising technology. So how might technological innovation attract other groups that have turned away from traditional news sources? One group are young adults, known as millennials, age 18 to 35. At first glance, these people may seem to be disengaged from traditional news, but there are topical issues they will engage with, but only on their terms. For the past year, Media Company BuzzFeed has been streaming a morning video show that's a mix of hard news and celebrity gossip on the social media channel Twitter. BuzzFeed provides the journalism, communicated in the way that they think their audience wants, and what's trending on Twitter helps to set the agenda. Good morning, Twitter. She is Zara Hirji. I am Stephanie McNeil, and you are watching AM to DM, where we have gotten through the midterm elections. Let's all do a deep exhale. The team starts looking over the course of the previous evening and then that morning about what's just happening on Twitter. Sharnie Hilton is vice president of news and programs at BuzzFeed. Often our host are scanning Twitter while they're talking, while they're doing interviews and pulling in questions from the timeline and pulling in topics from the timeline. They're asking what do you care about. And then they're bringing, while they're doing interviews, and pulling in questions from the timeline and pulling in topics from the timeline. They're asking, what do you care about? And then they're bringing that into the production meetings. If you are looking on AM to DM at the pool of information that's out there on Twitter, how are you actually getting the entire news agenda across, rather than just delivering exactly what the audience wants to get. One thing that's easy to do is to join a pylon, like, oh, everybody agrees this is bad. And one thing that we find that's very important to do is actually take a minute and interrogate, why do people think this thing is bad? Is it actually bad? And so, you know, our editors are often pushing in that direction. Like, what's at often pushing in that direction. Like, what's at the root of that? The show's daily audience is between 500,000 and 1 million. That's a CNN and Fox News Network Challenger right there. And nearly all the people watching are the type of viewers that other channels are losing. What we're looking at are people who are really millennials, like true millennials, who are coming to us regularly to get their news. Why is that interactivity so important to them? We want to know that we're not being delivered information from on high from, you know, sort of a generic older man. You know, I think everybody is ready to hear for people who look and feel and sound like them. And so we're just so much more used to a give and take, a back and forth of information. To me, it's the only way that it's going to work. Well, we asked you guys how you're feeling after all of the election results last night. We're seeing kind of a mix on our timeline, but keep letting us know how you're feeling. Yes, please keep on. BuzzFeed sees interactivity as the inevitable future. And that is something that all sorts of new technologies can exploit. Take smart speakers, for example. Sales are growing across the world at a phenomenal rate, and some countries by around 50% annually, which means that many media organizations are looking at how interactivity might change how we consume the kind of audio we used to call radio, including here at the BBC. My producer, Roz, visited the BBC's Research and Development offices in West London. One of my team came back from the states with a smart speaker before they were available in this country. This is George Wright. He's head of internet research and future services and was initially cautious about how smart speakers might change things. In all honesty, I was very skeptical because often what we find in R&D is that new devices can be used to do in effect what I would call a better yesterday. And that isn't why we come to work. It's got to be truly radical and groundbreaking. One of the team members who persuaded George that smart speakers might be groundbreaking was Henry Cook. He's the one who brought that smart speaker from the US into the R&D office. They are voice interactive. We now have this capability for them to start talking back to that content and start to build in that interactive loop and that's what starts to make them really interesting and transformative as a radio listening device. So I can kind of communicate with the radio without having to go over and press a button. That's Nikki Birch. She works with Henry. Being able to move around the house, then it really starts to become essential. And if I'm in the car and I can start communicating with the radio in a way that is perhaps safer, then that also becomes more valuable. So together, Henry and Nikki started experimenting with all kinds of maybe useful, maybe valuable, certainly innovative possibilities for our newest domesticated robots. At the end of last year, Nikki and I released a piece for smart speakers called the Inspection Chamber. And that was an interactive radio drama. So you hear it play on your smart speaker. It has the production values of a radio play. Being, are you ready to be inspected? Yes. Good. I must say you appear to be a very interesting specimen. In this piece, there are four characters. Two alien scientists, their glitchy robot friend, and a mysterious alien creature that they've just discovered. And the only way that they have of finding anything out about this creature is by asking it questions. And if they figure it out, they can go home. And about a minute, a minute and a half into the story, you realize that you are the fourth character. You're this alien creature that they are investigating. Being, which of these do you identify with? Humanoid, Hoogamap, Humberg, hummus, or carrot? Carrot. See? It's a vegetable. So you get the gist. And it's kind of silly. It's a science fiction kind of comedy. But it was demonstrating what you can do. So it's proved to be quite a useful exercise. I'm really passionate believer in interactive content and the potential that it could offer. But we're waiting for the thing that might make interactive content more mainstream. It's important to state that despite the huge growth and sales of smart speakers, there aren't very many apps available for them. There's nowhere near the size and the variety that there are for smartphones. Smart speakers haven't really yet found their sweet spot for millennial audiences, we've been told, but they are popular with the older crowd and a brand new demographic. Small kids. Certainly, for the children, using voice alone to access content is much more intuitive and straightforward. It's going up. Door's opening. In a shared office space, in a part of London, which incubates a lot of new tech companies, my producer, Roz, went to meet Jess Williams. She co-founded O'Perlo just two years ago. It's on the bleeding edge of this smart speaker wave. The company develops voice apps, also known as skills, for the Amazon Echo, which many of us call Alexa. There's probably between two and four kind of companies our size doing the same things as what we're doing. In London, and then over in the US, you know, there's another dozen or so still not that many actually though not that many no it's quite a brave decision to launch into something so new i mean you must obviously have faith in this yeah definitely all of the big tech giants are investing so much money into this area and you, the way that we monetise is actually through a program from Amazon. Amazon basically reward their top developers with monthly sums of money on an per app basis. So this is obviously Amazon trying to grow the market. And I guess thinking that if it left it to its own devices it would be hard for companies like yours to get through the early stages. Definitely. One of Operlo's most popular apps is a game for children. Welcome to the panda rescue game. To your delight you discover there are two baby pandas. One is the little boy and the other a little girl. Would you like to look after the boy or the girl? The girl. Okay. What would you like to name there? Rosie. Okay. You want to name your baby baby. Basically, apart from giving the name and choosing the boy girl, every other response mostly is a yes or no. We did that on purpose, so it was easy to use. A child can start speaking to Alexa before she learns to read and write. And so I think that's quite scary, but also very powerful. I've heard, as an anecdote, a family going on holiday and the children bringing the echo device because they didn't want to leave Alexa by herself whilst they were away, she's really become part of the family. And I guess what's interesting is that if small children get to voice, of Alexa by herself whilst they were away, she's like really become part of the family. And I guess what's interesting is that if small children get to voice, you know, when they're really very young, I mean it could mean that that is the go-to way of getting information, of search of all sorts of things. Yeah, completely agree with that. And it's not just the Alexa platform as well. You know, there's Google. So you're developing a relationship with a brand effectively. And making it more human, I think makes the attachment a lot stronger. Which is both interesting, exciting and, yes, concerning for some people too. Henry Cook from BBC R&D is conscious of the need for extra care in how these objects are designed and programmed. It does throw up like an existing set of things about how you find knowledge into sharp relief because on a laptop if you're trying to find something out, you can open a bunch of tabs and you can do different searches and all of those tabs and you can read a bunch of different sources and you can sort of synthesize your own version of the truth. But if you're talking to a device, then ultimately what that device says to you is governed by software. And the product team who have made that bit of software, have had to make some choices about which information sources they use and how they judge what is most relevant. You ask a smart speaker a question and it tells you something and... It's not always right. It's not a commercial reasons that the device manufacturers have chosen to offer something from provider X or Y and it's their device, it's their rules. That's BBC R&D's George Wright. That makes it quite difficult to say, you can always trust this device because ultimately you can't. You get into the question of Wright according to who, right? Is that something we want? The world becomes privatised, doesn't it, corporatized? Right. The most concerning aspect of this new media landscape is how easy it is now to be uncritical about what's being fed to us. If we don't know who's doling the information out, we won't know to look for alternative or contradictory sources. And similarly, we might not get a breadth of information. In the good old days, when most of us sat passively in front of the television watching shows, as the schedule unfolded, an editor was in charge of making sure we had a varied news diet. But watching only what we ask for means that we're less likely to randomly encounter different opinions, say, or new and challenging information. There's a concept in the BBC called Hammocking, which used to be a show at 1900 that people wanted to watch and a show at 20,00 that they wanted to watch. And in the middle, they'd put a show that the BBC thought they should watch. And then it would look like a hammock because it would lose 3 million viewers or listeners, but they would still get 8 million. So for us, the concept of digital hammocking is important to suggest things for people that we think they should like. How do you make digital hammocking work? We haven't yet done this. So I'm freestyling. So what you're getting at is you know this is important and something needs to be done, but actually has anybody worked that out yet, do you think? No, no one's worked this out yet. Digital radio and podcasting have started to eat away at the traditional radio programming schedule. Smart speakers could seal the deal. But with the market as yet so undeveloped, that's hard to call. What we do know is that it is unlikely to flop and die now because they are in so many homes, they're relatively cheap to purchase. That's only going to go down. And they are increasingly built into mobile handsets as well. In many countries, on-demand TV is already transforming the industry. So how else might new technology, or perhaps newly improved technology, transform how we watch and what we watch? Ross went to Bermansy and South London to meet Visualize, a production company based in what was once a biscuit factory with busy commuter train lines overhead. One of the company's specialisms is virtual reality content. And yes, you've heard of VR before. There have been high hopes for it for decades. In fact, the most recent hype cycles were in 2013 and 2014. Literally the phone was ringing off the hook, and we couldn't answer emails fast enough. This is co-founder Henry Stewart. He believes it takes a lot for people to put a headset on to watch something. the hook and we couldn't answer emails fast enough. This is co-founder Henry Stewart. He believes it takes a lot for people to put a headset on to watch something. Psychologically, people prefer to watch alongside others as part of a social experience. So VR might work for games when you're fully immersed in a story and you want to navigate it on your own. But for other content, his view is that what's on offer has to be exceptional for that barrier to be overcome. And until very recently, that was not the case. Head sets are now coming down in price and content is getting better. It's not really growing on the hype anymore. It's growing on the foundations of people who understand the content and want to apply it for very practical reasons. So we're getting less inquiries now, but they're much more informed. For example, charities is a big one. And they're saying, we want to put people in the shoes of the work that we're doing. One of visualis clients is the International Committee of the Red Cross based in Geneva, Switzerland. And one of the charity's visual producers is Christopher Nicholas. People see so many images around the world. They can become a little bit apathetic. They see them on TV. They see them on social media. So we kind of hope that using virtual reality will be a new and sort of powerful way to get their attention. The Red Cross's VR experience is called The Right Choice. It's about a Syrian family in their living room as the fighting is occurring all around them. I took a deep breath and I put on my headset. Mine was a Google Cardboard into which I placed my smartphone. It's literally a piece of cardboard that I got for less than five US dollars and in some places, cardboard are handed out for free. I can actually walk into and towards the three people who are sitting on the floor. I frankly feel a little bit awkward about them, about standing here and they're not seeing me. It's very strange to be inside this experience. You're a non-participant invader in a very personal space. I know that I'm in my home in Los Angeles, but it's still startling and very frightening. I can't escape except by pulling the headset off. All I can do is stare at the awful events that are unfolding in front of me. We're very interested in this idea that virtual reality can be seen as some kind of empathy machine. And in fact, we're conducting our own research to see if showing these kind of films to a broad public can create some kind of empathy and potential behavior change. Are there any early indications of those results? Well, it's not scientific, but we asked people before they watch the film, you know, how concerned are you about the plight of people living in urban conflict? Then we got them to watch the film. We only polled about 50 people, but there was a small change. They said they felt more concerned having watched the film. But our plan is to replicate that all over the world. And that will help us decide, do we go forward with this? This sort of real immersivity has created this kind of empathy. But where does that go, right? Yeah, it's a good point. Does being empathetic lead to better support for our work? Does it lead to more donations? Does it lead to political change? It's quite difficult to measure any of it, really. As a piece of factual content, it works because it's compelling. But as with most of the VR that's currently out there, I wouldn't watch it again. This is a big experiment for the Red Cross. It took the better part of a year to make the right choice. But the financial burden was much less heavy than it might have been, as the project was largely funded by Google. So, looking forward, is VR a medium for news and documentaries? Henry Stewart says that that is already happening. It's just a perfect medium for documentary storytelling because you get to put somebody in the very place that you're talking about and the technology on the capture side has moved on so quickly and it's immediately empowered a huge amount of virtual reality journalism all over the world. A daily news program in VR is not yet financially viable, but Henry believes that as long as investment keeps on coming, the technology will take off. A reasonable number of our jobs have actually, if you dig far enough back, actually Google or Facebook might be the one putting their hand in their pocket for them, just like the Red Cross project was. The thing I've found interesting, as I've been making this program, both in VR but also in the world of smart speakers and in other areas, is just how much of what's going on is being supported by Facebook, by Google, by Amazon. What does that tell you? What it shows you is that there's still a huge amount of investment being pushed in by the tech giants and it's not quite floating by itself yet. I think they're doing everything they can to make sure this takes off. Smart speakers and VR share a common problem. They have found their niches, but they are struggling to branch out. At the moment, new technology is looking for content. News could be the killer app for these devices, so people will return to them again and again. Otherwise, they'll arrive with fanfare at Christmas, but be covered by dust at Easter. And while the people driving the next generation of media coverage might look like pioneering startups, a lot of the money that's behind them is coming from the big technology giants. We don't know what their intentions are in the newsroom, but we have some idea already that their algorithms are being used to divide rather than to unite us. The future is not a single invention or a device. It's a shift in accepting a new arbiter of information, one that may not have a journalistic legacy, or indeed, a journalistic intent. Alexa, turn off the living room lights, please. Okay, thank you. No worries. That was Global Business on the BBC World Service with me, Alex Kratoski. The producer was Rosamund Jones, and the editor was Penny Murphy."}
