Hello, you're listening to the BBC's World of Business. I'm John Murphy and I'm a producer. And recently I went with my colleague Ruth Alexander to Bulgaria, where we visited the country's first ever science and technology park to see if it'll spark an entrepreneurial revolution in the EU's poorest country. And this is what we found. Try to use your feet more. Yeah. I'm sort of... Here you're a strong part of the body. Try to keep your arms straight. Okay. Isn't it? Oh my God. I've just looked down. That's a long way down. Wow. Okay. Isn't it? Oh my God. I've just looked down. That's a long way down. Wow. Okay. Don't look down. I'm only three meters off the ground. This is a shameful performance. Okay. So if I put one, maybe one foot there. Here you go. I'm Ruth Alexander, clinging on for dear life for global business on the BBC World Service at an indoor climbing centre in Bulgaria. You know what? I've reached my limit. No, I've reached my limit. I'm coming down. It looked so easy from the ground, but I quickly discovered there's a lot more to scaling a gym wall than I thought, and a lot more to the whole business of climbing walls. My guide Annie Maneva can back me up here, on the climbing bit at least. It's the best workout. You can get like full body workout. All your muscles are involved. And besides just moving up and down, it involves some mental workout as well. Because you have to think about your next move, you have to find the balance of your body. There is a little bit of adrenaline brush when you go up those high walls as well. I mean, it's so high. I mean, to feel how high 19 meters is, you basically have to drop your head right back and look at the ceiling. Yeah, it's pretty high for an indoor climbing space. And the other thing about this particular climbing wall is that it's at the centre of Bulgaria's very first science and technology park. It's hoped that this business, a startup that went global, will help others replicate its success. The tech park opened in 2015 with the aim of creating a tech-led business revolution in this former communist country, one that would jumpstart the economy. Bulgaria is one of the European Union's poorest members. It's seen many of its young people leave to find opportunities elsewhere. I've come here to see whether the tech park plan is working. Much of the funding for the park comes from the EU. Waltopia is so far the only private investor. And like so many of the best business stories, this one started in a garage. I caught up with the co-founder of Waltopia, Vylo Penchev, on the phone. Yes, we started in a garage. It was not our garage. We rented it. Having a tight budget, Avilo had already had to push aside a burning desire to be an astronaut. This was my dream. I didn't quit it, though. I will be an astronaut. He was making a living selling plastic bags when he and his friend, Metin Mussov, decided to turn their love of climbing into a business. And it was a really small business, but then the industry itself started to grow. And for some reason, we became the biggest company in the world doing artificial climbing calls. What was the reason? What was the secret of your success? No secret. It's really simple. I think I was the most clever men in this industry. That's what I think. People in Woltoppe were more clever than the others and more responsible. And another reason, both of the founders, me and Matin, we are short. We are 170 and ugly. Short and ugly helps a lot, yeah. Why? Because we need a tool to have access to women. We are not tall and handsome. We should be successful somehow. To impress the ladies? Of course, yes. Has it worked? It worked, yeah. Excellent. Back in the climbing centre, it's not just the ladies who are impressed. This wall is crazy. Is it? Yeah, it's... It's an impressive wall? Uh-huh. I've climbed a few spots in the States, and this is easily the biggest one I've seen to date. Waltopia has customers in 50 countries and uses its climbing walls at Sofia Tech Park to test out new technologies to try to maintain its edge. This new system uses translucent holes that are lit up from behind by an LED and you can control the color of the LED for every single climbing hole. The system is called eWOLs and it's designed to help staff members of the gym and gym operators change the routes easily and they can upload the routes in an internet platform because the way you control the LEDs is through a mobile application. So that means that a gym can think, okay, I've got a beginners class this morning, we'll put the pink route up and they can do that pretty much at a push of a button. And then after lunch they've got the advanced group coming so they can change it to the purple route. Yep. And there's gym operators that own five or ten gyms. And for every single gym, they need to hire a different set of root setters. That's the people who create the routes. And using this system, they can just hire one really good root setter that would set up their really hard routes for advanced climbers and they can share it with all the rest of the gyms they own this way. The company started with two clever men in a garage. Now it employs hundreds of clever people in a futuristic building that dominates one corner of the tech park. Behind the scenes, I peered at the screen belonging to one of them, Alexander Christoff. I am part of the engineer's theme. And what we do actually is we are creating the panels, the puzzle. It's the surface of the wall. So on your screen here, I can see a 3D version of this. Yeah, actually, we are getting the design here from the design department. And what we are figuring out here is how many panels we are going to use, how we are going to cut them, how we are going to join them. Is this for a particular kind? Yeah, it's a wall that we are building in the US. Is all this going to be built in Bulgaria and then shipped to America? Yeah, of course, yeah, yeah. The factory is located here in Bulgaria. So everything is produced here and just shipped there for assembly. Walking around the headquarters of Waltopia, you feel like you could be in any Silicon Valley company. It's staffed by bright young things in jeans and trainers staring at their screens. While they were looking out of one of the floor-to-ceiling windows, I spied a crumbling concrete building, a reminder of how new this kind of startup success story is in Bulgaria. In another of the Tech Park's buildings, known as the Incubator, I find a company with an even more relaxed attitude, where they positively encourage you to write on their wall. Right, I'm just dying to draw a tree. Well, actually, it's pretty nice. It's different when you're writing on the wall, right? Yeah, it's very smooth. And it's different than whiteboard, right? Man letting me draw on his wall is Iskren Mitev. Iskran. It means sincere in Bulgarian. He's one of the founders of Eskrio, a fledgling company that's set up in the tech park. Eskrio means you create from Latin. We transform every surface into a place where you can express, write ideas, think visual and collaborate more effectively. They've developed a paint which you can put on furniture and walls, yes, walls again, so that you can draw on them with marker pen and easily wipe it off. And usually permanent markers don't go of normal dry erase paint. But we have a paint that you can also dry wipe permanent marker, which is amazing. I mean, this just doesn't exist. Are you the first people to do that? The first I know. So who is your market? Who wants this stuff, do you hope? Our best customer who understands our products super fast are the children. Because they want to write on walls. Always. I mean, they're our perfect customer, but they're not our current customer. We are currently selling to offices, architect, design, studios, because more and more companies are trying to bring this creativity and freedom of self-expression in the office. What gave you this idea? We were in a program in the United States for entrepreneurship. We went to one place that was all painted like that. So we tried to start selling this in Bulgaria from the producers in the United States, but they told us, you know, you're a super small market, we don't care about it so much, so we're not interested. And this discourages in the United States but they told us you know you're super small market we don't care about it so much so we're not interested and this discourages in the beginning but then we decided that we will do it no matter what your company hasn't come up with this idea you've borrowed it shall we say from somebody else no we didn't borrow it we yeah I mean you can you can see like this yeah we more it was we liked the idea. We wanted to do it here. But what inspired us mostly was the rejection. I mean, you know, when something is prohibited and you cannot do it, then you find more strength. So we started looking for different solutions and we were super lucky to find a chemist. Bulgaria has a region that is close to Danube that has very developed the chemical industry. So one of the top guys in one of the companies became our founder also and he invented this paint. And while that original American paint supplier that they wanted to work with figured that Bulgaria's consumer market was too small, Iskrent sees the advantages of being one of the EU's poorest countries. For example, my previous company was an IT company that was a startup again. You're one of these people who's got a string of failed startups behind you which I believe is meant to be a sort of sign of success this is a learning curve okay so you hear this in Silicon Valley that you know it's good to have a company and to fail because then you've learned it's not a failure it's a success yeah I think you should not be afraid of failing but my point was that we were an IT company and you have to know that in Bulgaria to hire a super good IT professional, it was like 150 euros per month, the salary. So we were super competitive. For example, in France, the cost of acquiring the same level of development was 7,500 euros per month. So you're hoping that with this business that you could undercut rivals because you can do it all more cheaply? For sure. Another factor that makes Bulgarian companies potentially competitive on price is that corporation tax there is low, only 10%. That's almost half what it is in the UK, about a third of what it is in Germany and France. But its communist past means that venture capital culture is not very developed. Escrio has got most of its funding from a European Union business accelerator program, and it's also been attracting the interest of some novice local investors. In the second round, it was very funny because some people were coming here in our office with like a small bag of money and telling I want to invest in your company. And it was was come on it's not the way you should do it like you should just go through the bank and know you have the contracts so this was very nice that people well it's a compliment yeah it was a compliment just like I want to invest in your money and coming with the envelope with money and we say no no this is like why were they trying to give you some of these people cash in hand what does that tell no it's not uh if you imply that this is how it's that in bulgaria it's not this is not true they just because this is something very new here the idea of investing in the startup is new so people don't know how to do it people don't know how to do it they don't know how to trust you also the legal procedures were not developed like they are now. Bulgaria does have a problem with corruption. EU monitors say it has made progress since it joined the union a decade ago, but not enough. Bulgaria does have a reputation for corruption. Does that worry you? What's it like trying to start a business here in that environment? I think that this is our only choice. Let's say at least this was my perspective when I started my business. I knew that I can work for someone and I will be involved in some dirty practices. For example, in Bulgaria is very common that your employer doesn't pay the taxes of all your payment like if you i don't say 1 000 euro is your salary they pay the government like they're paying you 200 euros and all the rest is given on the table for example i mean this is super common the size of this is amazing like super big companies in bulgaria siphoning off money that should be going into the government's coffers in taxes and it's going into people's pockets. Who knows where? Yeah, but I mean, actually startups are very smart mechanism of the EU legal body to create clean businesses. Because if I receive funding from EU, everything should be done perfectly. And if my employees, for example, start seeing that this kind of work environment exists, even if they quit their work, they will be looking for an employer that will adopt the same practices. So you're hoping here to make your ideas successful, and also to do your part to help clean up corruption in Bulgaria? Not only clean up corruption. This is somehow giving a good example of how things should be done and educating the workforce, what should they be looking for. Across the corridor in the office of another startup, playground energy, I get a quick geography lesson. Here we are using thermal energy, so energy of the body heat. So if you would like to see where New York is located just to study geography or Paris, just put your hand there. Pristo Alexiev puts his hand on a poster just below a map of the world. And then the body heat of my hand is actually producing now electricity which is illuminating the air-ed-showing where on the map is Paris. There we see a little light on France. Yes. As you put your hand on there. Yes. Okay. So where is Tokyo? Playground energy designs play and learning equipment that capitalizes on children's energy. That's Tokyo. That's great. The idea is that there is no battery, nothing, it is just a board. And the body heat of the children's hand or adult's hand is producing enough electricity, so it's powering one LED. It's much more interesting than a little sticker on Tokyo or Paris, isn't it? It's much more interactive as well. Yeah. And it's not just children's hands that can generate electricity, their bottoms can too. Bristow shows me a seat they've made for a seesaw. This, for example, is a seat which, when it moves, you see, it produces electricity. There is no battery, there is nothing inside. It's a white seat, but when you move it, there's a green flashing light. Yes, inside there is a proprietary generator created bars for which we have patent pending. And how much would something like this cost? Would it be affordable for a school or a parent? Yes, it would be affordable. Believe me, we are selling. We are not just keeping them here. And where are you selling in Bulgaria? No, no, it's 90% of our power are international sales. We are delivering to Australia, Asia, Europe, North and South America. Hopefully we will start delivering to Africa as well. Are you profitable yet? No. When do you expect to be? Next year. This is Hristo's sixth company and he's had success in the past. He was one of the early founders of Waltopia, the climbing company, and he's feeling positive about this latest venture. My business partner, Ilya Milinov, is one of the really best industrial designers in the world. This red dot design award is like Oscars for actors and he has not one, not two, not three, but four Red Dot Designer Awards. So he's one of the most awarded industrial designers in the world. And he's your business partner, look at you. Yes, he's, yes. We are business partners and we're also friends. We know each other since 25 years. Okay, so that helps. So you trust each other. You know how each other's worked? Yes. When you fall out, it's okay? Well, we never fall out. We just have a temporarily slow down. Ha ha. You leave the room, go cool down, have a coffee, punch a wall. Yes, exactly. And then start work again. Yes. The company's growing fast. Last year, we had just money employee, now we are eight. We are growing and it is not easy to find good employees, but it is possible. You've got educated people. But many of them have in the past certainly left Bulgaria, gone abroad. That's a challenge for you. But I can give you the other examples. For example, you could see there, Munchil, which is sitting there. He came from the United Kingdom. Ah, I see. So you managed to tempt a Bulgarian back into the country? Obviously not with money, because we can't compete with big financial institutions in UK. But yeah, we managed. Did you take a big pay cut to come back? Yeah, I can say so. Life also here is much cheaper than in London. London is very expensive. So it was a bit of a risk coming by. It wasn't an easy decision. It's a measured risk. Look at it as an investment. At the moment, I'm happy that I'm able to do work that I enjoy in a setting that I enjoy and contribute to something that is very meaningful that the company is building and doing and at some point maybe financially it will pay off. So Mumchil Marinoff, the finance director, is taking a personal calculated risk and Heristo tells me the company itself, like any startup that's growing quickly, is a risky business. My main challenge is to really manage the things and the resources so that we don't end up finishing without starting. What challenges do you face as a business in a country which has had such a difficult recent past? I wouldn't say it was a difficult past. It was just different. And challenges are quite regular. We were lucky to live in both worlds. And for me, I'm thankful that I had a chance to see both. Now I value what I have and now I value what I would have if I continue to work. Is there a challenge finding investors? Yes, it is a challenge as well it is in London. When they see potential, I don't think that we are coming from Bulgaria is a problem. None of potential investors is ever asking me why you are in Bulgaria or something. Very often the decision whether to invest or not is not exactly where we are located, but many other and more important things like how we manage and where are we going, not from where we come. I'm impressed by the energetic individuals I'm meeting, their ambition and optimism, but walking through the building, they seem few in number. To my left is another office. It's empty, no office furniture at all. So there's clearly room for more companies to move in here. It's not full yet. Apparently, I'm mistaken. The fresh-faced 33-year-old chief executive of Sofia Tech Park, Asan Nunchev, tells me. There's a few empty offices that is noticeable, so this is something you're still trying to build up. You mean empty in terms of that there were no people when you went there? No. No. The actual capacity of the incubator is 100% full. Oh, there were some rooms where there were no desks and no chairs? There are six rooms that are without desks and chairs, but that's because on every floor it's supposed to be a kitchen, but it's not built yet. Otherwise, the incubator is at 100% full capacity. It has 25 startup companies and 5 grown companies that help to support the startup companies to get to their final aim, which is to produce a product or a service. Asan Nenchev has since left the Tech Park. A new CEO is in position, the sixth in the park's short existence. I've been told that the startup companies are supported by 11 highly equipped research labs, but most of them were closed up when I tried to take a peek inside. This it was August was most likely a factor, but outside in the courtyard I did get a distinctly tumbleweed feeling. It's a lovely setting, you know, grass, pathways, water features, lovely new buildings all around willow tree just here. The sun is shining, beautiful breeze. But I've barely seen anyone else out here. I've been here a few hours now and a couple of people walking past here. But honestly, the first people I've seen in quite a while, it's very quiet. It seems almost deserted. And it's not only me thinking this so is the tech park's only private investor evalo pench of waltopia who was convinced to move his headquarters there by the tech parks management the sales pitch was that there will be full of innovative young people with dreams with great atmosphere and things like that, innovation, science, science fiction. That's what convinced me. I wanted to be among these people. And was that what you found when you got there? No, no, there is no one. Why do you think that is? Because there is no private investment there. If there is no entrepreneur running a business, the business is artificially alive. It's undead. Undead, a zombie business. Sofia Tech Park's only major private investor is its biggest critic. If Ilo Penchav fell out with the park management earlier in the year over the late completion of his building, for which he was fined, but he doesn't even seem to believe in the year over the late completion of his building for which he was fined. But he doesn't even seem to believe in the project. There is a lot of clerks officials which are enthusiastic spending someone else money. But there is no value in this. I don't think that Sofia Tech Park will create value. I spoke to some young people starting up businesses in the Tech Park. What advice would you give them? Not to rely on European money. Clerks are giving this money. So this is not market-driven spreading of resources. It's clerk-driven spreading of resources. This European funds in Bulgaria, they are spent not wisely. At best case, they are spent not wise. So it's just dry fruits, basically. Mm. Yes. Did not. And this is good for me, is it? Absolutely. Why? Another startup I meet has a different idea of what the problem is. What's so high tech about your food? We're interesting of finding out more about the performance of organic foods. Plom and Madarov, back in Bulgaria after more than a decade spent in New Zealand, the US and the UK, is the co-founder of Go for Raw, a raw food startup. I think the tech hub is doing really good being the first tech part now open in Bulgaria. Now that's a really big challenge for the government to be able to turn the really good being the first tech park now open in Bulgaria. Now that's a really big challenge for the government to be able to turn this tech park really quick and to connect the business with the science. Because we're coming to the topic of Bulgarian people and they're thinking. It's not the government thought that the tech park cannot be full and busy really quick. It's the problem of the population. So just right now, there just simply isn't enough entrepreneurial spirit out there? Absolutely. To be able to work with them, you need to have an idea. You need to have a research and development, a product, let's say, to be able to start working with them and that is still missing. But while it may be early days for the Tech Park, among all the people I speak to there, I pick up a lot of optimism about the broader business outlook. Bulgaria can be the kitchen for Europe. Yeah, what do you mean the kitchen? The kitchen. We're doing everything for Europe. We're what do you mean the kitchen? The kitchen. We're doing everything for Europe. We're the small China of Europe for any type of products. I definitely believe that we are such a place, not potentially such a place, but such a place, and probably it will be discovered soon by many other people. Even the cynic, Evalo Penchev of Waltopia, has a positive outlook, sort of. The good thing in Bulgaria is that we have low taxes. So even if there is corruption, corrupt politicians have to spend not so much. They have just 10% of our money. They can use just 10% of our money for corruption. I think the world sees Bulgaria in darker colors than it should be. It's a better place that people think for doing business. I was impressed by the go-getting entrepreneurs I met at Sofia Tech Park. It had take thousands more of them, though, to make a difference to the country's economy. If the government is serious about turning the capital into one of Europe's leading tech hubs, it has much to do. Global business was presented by me, Ruth Alexander. The producer was John Murphy. Yoga is more than just exercise. It's the spiritual practice that millions swear by. And in 2017, Miranda, a university tutor from London, joins a yoga school that promises profound transformation. It felt a really safe and welcoming space. After the yoga classes, I felt amazing. But soon, that calm, welcoming atmosphere leads to something far darker, a journey that leads to allegations of grooming, trafficking, and exploitation across international borders. I don't have my passport, I don't have my phone, I don't have my bank cards, I have nothing. The passport being taken, the being in a house and not feeling like they can leave. World of Secrets is where untold stories are unveiled and hidden realities are exposed. In this new series, we're confronting the dark side of the wellness industry, with the hope of a spiritual breakthrough gives way to disturbing accusations. You just get sucked in so gradually, and it's done so skillfully that you don't realize. And it's like this, the secret that's there. I wanted to believe that, you know, that whatever they were doing, even if it seemed gross to me, was for some spiritual reason that I couldn't you understand. Revealing the hidden secrets of a global yoga network. I feel that I have no other choice. The only thing I can do is to speak about this and to put my reputation and everything else on the line. I want truth and justice and for other people to not be hurt for things to be different in the future. To bring it into the light and almost alchemise some of that evil stuff that went on and take back the power. World of Secrets, Season 6, The Bad Guru. Listen wherever you get your podcasts."}
