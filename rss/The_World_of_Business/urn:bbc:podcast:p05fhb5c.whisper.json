This is the BBC's world of business. I'm Matthew Gweather and the producer is Rosamond Jones. In this week's download edition of In Business from BBC Radio 4, we're looking at risk and asking, where are the lines in the sand when it comes to companies operating abroad? Companies broke free of national borders centuries back. We live in a truly globalised world where trade and investment cross borders on a routine basis in search of profit. But there are places where the risks of doing business can be considerable. Recent years have seen terrorist attacks, warfare and political upheaval. The headlines this morning, forces loyal to Turkey's government appear to have quashed an attempted military coup. There have been hundreds of arrests and dozens of... In other places there are the problems of corruption, criminality, civil unrest, and even outright economic collapse. It's been over a month of protests here in Venezuela. This is an economy in crisis. The inflation rate could reach 700% before the end of the year. So when businesses operate beyond their own shores, there are risks, operational, financial and reputational. This program is about lines in the sand. At what point do businesses decide when enough is enough and that the risks have outweighed the benefits? Should they stay or should they go? How do these decisions get made? Russia in the 1990s was a time when, following the collapse of a Soviet-run economy, the free market was allowed to let rip. It was like the wild west. When I first arrived there, it was absolutely chaotic. So if you put your hand out to hail a taxi, 10 cars would all pull over, including one ambulance, one police car, who all were looking for fares. You go to the art museum and they would sell you the paintings right off the wall. It was just complete chaos. This is Bill Browder, the founder of Investment Fund Hermitage, which at its peak was the largest foreign investor in Russia. Browder is the unlikely arch-capitalist grandson of the head of the US Communist Party, and he arrived in Moscow in 1996. This was a time when many old Soviet utility companies were being sold off, putting the oligarchs on the road to unimaginable riches. Browder realized these wild, high-risk and uncertain times could be highly profitable for him and his investors. The investment thesis was very straightforward that if it starts out, it's complete an absolute chaos, and then it goes to just somewhat chaotic. You can make 10 or 20 or 30 times your money. And in fact, we successfully made something like 40 times our money. Browda made money by being what's known as an activist shareholder. This means that rather than just buying shares in the hope that they would increase in value, he bought shares in companies in order to bring about change in how they were run. My big contribution was to go into terribly corrupt companies and then research how they did the corruption and then expose that corruption. Some of the scams stopped as a result of our work and the share price went up and it was very fun both to make money and do good at the same time. Why did it work? Vladimir Putin had just become president when we started this, and he wasn't really all that powerful president because a lot of the powers of the presidency had been informally stolen by the oligarchs. And so there's an expression, your enemy's enemy is your friend, and Putin was also fighting with them. So for a period of time, our alignment of interests worked perfectly. But these were volatile times, dangerous times for those who had profited handsomely from the collapse of communism. There's a moment in time, a specific moment in October of 2003 when he arrested the richest oligarch in Russia. A man named Michael Hortikovsky put him on trial and allowed the television cameras to film the richest man in Russia sitting in a cage. And if you were the 17th richest man in Russia and you were on your yacht, parked off the hotel to Kaupin Antib, and you just finished up with your mistress in the bedroom and you go out to the living room and you flick on your CNN and you see the richest man in Russia. A guy far more powerful and far smarter than you sitting in a cage, what's your natural reaction going to be? Well, most of their reactions were they don't want to sit in the cage themselves. And so one by one by one, they went to Putin and said, Vladimir, what do we have to do to not sit in the cage? Following years of successful investment, sometimes making over Â£100 million in a year, Browder's noisy activism drew him much attention and made him many enemies, some in high places. His companies were then the subject of a complex fraud by a criminal gang involving some $230 million owed to the Russian state. The Russian authorities then accused him of complicity in fraud, and he was blacklisted by the Russian government as a threat to national security. In November 13, 2005, I was flying back to Moscow. It was a Sunday evening. I arrived in the Cherimachevo 2 airport. I went to the VIP lounge, which I'd been through hundreds of times before. And that night, they grabbed me from the lounge, four uniform guards, took me down to the basement of the airport, put me in the detention center, locked me up overnight. I sat there not knowing whether I was being arrested or deported. And then at 11 a.m. the next morning, they frogmarsh me back to the Airflot flight to London, walked me to the back of the plane, stuck me in a middle seat, and deported me back to London. And that was the last time I was in Russia for the last 12 years. Did you ever think when you went in there in the first place that it could get as bad as it did? You must have weighed up the risks. I thought it could get bad. I always felt like it could possibly happen that there would be a moment when I have 15 minutes to pack whatever I can pack and get out of there. I just never anticipated that I would never have that 15 minutes to pack my stuff. It's worth noting, despite everything, all the dangers, Browder himself did not make the decision to go. That call was made for him. It's often very difficult when you're fully entrenched in a place just up sticks and leave, and I wouldn't have done so if it hadn't been for them to come after me. With countries like that, would you recommend continued engagement in the hope that they'll come round or disinvestment? What's the answer? It all depends on how important it is for you to be there and how long you think the bad stuff is going to happen. For some companies, though, the bad stuff is what drives their business. Here I am in central London, hard by the River Thames. I'm about to visit a company which operates in a rapidly growing sector. It provides security in war-torn places all over the world. So it works with companies which enter countries that most other foreign businesses have long since left. My name is Sylvia White, and I'm General Counsel at Guarda World International Protective Services Division. GuardiWorld does a variety of security-related services, so guards on gates around the perimeter of, say, a camp or a villa, or mobile security where our teams would take our clients where they need to go. So tell me who would be a typical client for you? So government clients and also NGO development aid related clients, commercial clients, often oil and gas or mining. You operate in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Nigeria, Algeria, Yemen, Somalia, Libya, which are all places that would make many people anxious about doing business. How often do you decide that somewhere really has become too risky? I think it's very rare. I think managing security risks is our business. So if we were leaving at the drop of a hat, then we wouldn't be very successful at what we do. We are more likely to leave when a client decides to leave, but we do have situations where we've said to clients that we think it's time that you consider leaving. Oftentimes it's going to be where political instability coupled with either terrorism or criminal activity is such that we really don't think we can keep them safe anymore. They obviously have to make a decision about whether they're prepared to leave yet. They'll have to look into how much risk they believe they're taking, how much they've invested in that country, whether it will be possible to come back in if they have a sort of managed shutdown. I know we've had some close calls where we've been saying to a client, we really feel like it's time to consider leaving and they're not there yet. And we feel like we have managed to get out just in time and probably best examples of that are in relation to ISIS coming through parts of Iraq but everybody did get out and everybody was safe. Sylvia White like Bill Browder when he went to Russia knows that they are doing business in places where risks are starkly evident, but things are not always so straightforward. Situations can change. Take Venezuela. Just a few years back, huge oil wealth and a growing middle class made it one of the richest nations in South America. Large numbers of foreign companies had opened operations in the country in the good times. Now a collapse in the oil price and a faltering economy has led to riots, civil unrest, and huge corruption. Daily life in Venezuela has become a real struggle. People have to queue for hours to be able to buy basic goods as well as to get medicines from the pharmacy, even to get cash from the ATM because the Venezuelan currency, the Bolivar, has devalued itself massively, so notes here are worth nothing. The situation was really grim. This is Leo Martin of the Good Corporation, a corporate social responsibility consultancy. He was in Venezuela as the crisis was mounting. The government was trying to change the foreign exchange rules. So the access to foreign exchange is crucial for many companies operating in Venezuela. You need to get access to dollars so that you can carry on importing and buying all the raw materials you need to manufacture or produce or to operate. And the government at the time had, I think, a third or a fourth attempt to change the rules, all to benefit government elites and make it harder and harder for the private sector to access foreign exchange. Corruption is absolutely endemic. Every deal that we heard about, and I was working in four or five companies and visiting them and talking about their operations there, every big deal that we talked about had some element of corruption. So it's not just the direct economic mess the country was in at the time. The ethics issues were extraordinarily complex, even two years ago. And I imagine, from all the news we've seen, it just got worse. The ones that you spoke to, did they then leave? None of them, from what I know, have actually left the country. And what I saw in Venezuela was companies preferring just to mothball and stop and reduce rather than to make a big statement or a declaration to leave. Some companies have now left, although it's hard to know the total numbers as they rarely publicise the fact. Others appear to be clinging on, keeping operations ticking over. A few are doing all they can to keep going. None of the companies we contacted wanted to talk about the various decisions they've made. And of course, these decisions are not easy. Even if a company is unhappy with how a country is being governed, if it leaves it deprives the country's citizens of beneficial economic activity, something Leo Martin knows only too well. I think if you won't and ask most Venezuelans at the time I was there, do you want these companies here or not? They would overwhelmingly say, yes, we want them here, because they pay us, the employment's good, it's good quality, they're helping development to the country, they're helping bring skills and expertise that we otherwise wouldn't have in Venezuela. You might argue that that is a lesser evil for them to stay and look after their workforce, carry on in training people and developing people and so on. But where a company is closely connected to the government in some way, for example, oil and gas or mining and you're exploiting the natural resources of the country and therefore paying huge royalties to the government, then I think companies should, but don't, take into account the wider ethics of the country and its impact on its population and how it's operating as a government. Assessing political risk in many parts of the world is no easy thing. I've now come to a nondescript office in the middle of London's financial centre. I'm here to meet someone who spent his working life trying to do just that. My name is John Ludlow and I'm the CEO at Airmick, the Association of Risk and Insurance Managers. And previously I was the head of risk and senior vice president at IHG, Intercontinental Hotels Group. We would have a lot of risk managers in the team. There was 60-od, I think it was, 65 risk managers scattered around the world, and they would be capable of coordinating and supporting local managers in pulling together crisis teams who could deal with issues. During your career in the hotel business, you were functioning in difficult areas across the world, in Libya and Egypt. So how did you approach the dilemmas that you face then? As an organisation, you stay out of the politics, do you? You try to, but inevitably in some of these areas of the world, it's the politicians who might own the hotels, or it's the people who maybe led the revolution ten years ago and have moved through and now they're sort of in charge of large businesses and maybe they own the hotels. So sometimes you're going to be dealing with people who are the new power. At the end of the day, you're in business and you have your reputation and you have to balance those two things. So don't walk in there with your eyes shut as an innocent. Know your brand, know your red lines. You always do your due diligence. Sometimes you have to do more and you do very detailed background due diligence. And it is living in the grey because the world is not black and white. It's not good guys and bad guys. There's a lot of grey out there and to succeed, you've got to deal with that. So tell us about the experience that you had in Libya, in particular. The hotel that you were running there was in the capital in Tripoli. We found the ownership of that hotel changed without us knowing about it. And we found that things were going on in thatoli. We found the ownership of that hotel changed without us knowing about it and we found that things were going on in that hotel which we weren't happy with and when the local militia start to interfere with running your hotel too much then you need to withdraw. I don't want to go into the absolute specifics of what was going on, but there were certainly things that crossed the line for us. So in those sorts of circumstances, you can suddenly have the building effectively taken over and owned by someone else altogether. It's very, very rare, but it can happen, and it did happen in that circumstance, yes. And I think Libya was probably one of the very few instances when we did actually up sticks and say, no, we can't be here. But very, very seldom would we ever do that. When things are difficult, it's often better to be there and stand with the community that you've invested in, stand with the owner that you've invested in, and be there for the staff that have been serving the guests down the years. That's part of being a responsible business, you know. Do you take a reputational risk when the choice between leaving and remaining becomes trickier and trickier? In leaving, your reputation takes a hit and in staying, your reputation takes a hit. Quite a dilemma, and one that may be exercising foreign business leaders and investors in Turkey, a country which attracted large amounts of interest from overseas in recent years. In a London cafe, I met Murat Ozdemier, country advisor for the UK at the Investment Support and Promotion Agency of Turkey. Right now, there are more than 54,000 foreign capital companies registered in Turkey. This number was only 5,615 years ago. So it's almost 10 times. I asked him why the numbers had increased so dramatically. Turkey is a growing economy. I mean, its growth is 5% on average. It has 80 million people and half of the population is underage, 30. And corporate tax reduced from 33% to 20% for all enterprises. So from foreign investors point of view, government is pro foreign investment. What do you want from a Thomas Cook family holiday this summer? I want to have fun. Tourism has also helped the economy in Turkey to grow. The Eastern Mediterranean has been a big market for many tour operators such as Thomas Cook. Come and see us in store or search Thomas Cook Turkey today. Until 2015, it was a significant market for Thomas Cook. The group's chief financial officer is Michael Healy. We would be sending somewhere in the region of about 4 million customers to Turkey, certainly within our top five destinations. But in the autumn of 2015 and throughout much of 2016, Turkey endured a series of terrorist attacks. It struck at the heart of Istanbul's old town, a huge explosion that rocked Sultanamance Square beside the Blue Mosque. Ambulances rushed to the scene. Most of those killed were German tourists. Several others were injured. And then in July 2016 there was an attempted military coup. There followed a widespread political crackdown involving the arrest and detention of business people, teachers, lawyers, journalists who were perceived as hostile to the regime. So what impact of these events had on business decisions? Michael Healy again. Even towards the end of 2015, customers were starting to be uneasy about going to Turkey. Despite at that stage, no official warnings and the fact that the terrorist attacks were in the cities, Istanbul and Ankara, rather than the coastal resorts, Thomas Cook decided to switch its operations as fast as it could. 1.2 million customers who would typically have gone to the East Mediterranean. We had to shift to new destinations at pretty short notice to Spain, Portugal, to Croatia, to Bulgaria, etc. And we also need to find hotel beds for them. We had to be very proactive in that because we appreciated that it wouldn't just be ourselves who would be looking to react. So we needed to move early, earlier than some of our competitors. And we couldn't find holidays for everyone that we wanted to. So we probably lost about three or four percent of our sales last year just because of that. Michael Healy is adamant, though. It was not the coup which made tourists wary of going to Turkey and forced Thomas Cook to change so many plans. I wouldn't say that high up on the agenda is the political situation in any particular country. And I think we've seen that through the history of Thomas Cook from the 70s when Thomas Cook really sort of moved into the package holidays in a big way. Spain became a big destination under Franco's Spain. So we're kind of apolitical. We operate out of 16 destinations. We operate out of Russia and China, for example. And so I don't think we would take that as a major consideration. It's about safety and security for our customers when it comes down to it. Tourist numbers to Turkey for Thomas Cook are still down, but beginning to pick up. And expectations are that in a year or so, normal business levels will resume. But what about other sectors? Turkey has a large number of sizeable, often family-run, industrial conglomerates, which are keen to work with foreign companies in joint ventures, which bring in much-wanted technical know-how. I spoke to a senior executive of one of them from a studio in Istanbul. My name is Osman Okyai, and I'm the vice-chairman of Kale Group. It was established back in 1957 by Dr. Ibrahim Bodur, who happens to be my father-in-law. We lost him last year, but he's been one of the successful entrepreneurs of Turkey. What sort of industries did he begin operating in back at the beginning? He started with ceramic tiles back in 1957. There was no production of tiles available in Turkey. And we went into defense and aerospace back in 1980s. With a billion and a half dollar turnover, Kale Group already has a joint venture with US aerospace business Pratt and Whitney. I wanted to talk about their more recent joint venture, signed a few months ago with Rolls Royce to make fighter jet engines. I'd assume that talks between the two companies had begun way before Turkey's recent troubles, but I was wrong. We had our first meeting back in June, June 2016. And we were able to sign the partnership agreement end of April 2017, which is not a long time in agreements like this. You moved pretty fast and you had an attempted political coup in the middle. Exactly. Roseroy's people were amazing, actually. They kept on visiting Turkey and in one of our meetings I still remember very well. You know, right after our meeting on a Friday afternoon, we had the airport bombing right after they left. And then the next one, they again, they were in town. Don't they find this sort of thing pretty startling? I think they're traveling over, they're traveling over from the UK to try and do business with you. And there's attempted coups, bombs in airports. Don't these sorts of things make them uneasy? Of course, I'm sure it does make them uneasy. But nevertheless, I'm sure it does make them uneasy, but nevertheless, they do believe in the future of Turkey, and Turkey does have ambitious defense and aerospace programs. When you get the degree of global instability that we're seeing at the moment, military and defense businesses benefit from that. Yes, and Turkey, you know, because of its geographical position, regardless of what the world is going through, what the region is going through, unfortunately it does have to have a strong army and strong defense and aerospace programs. Companies continue to partner up with Turkey in trade and investments. In fact, according to Mrat-Ozdemier from Turkey's investment support and promotion agency, political instability has not yet harmed foreign investment at all. If you compare, for instance, 10 months before the Kuwaitam and 10 months after the Kuatam in terms of foreign direct investment inflows, we see an increase. There was actually an increase after the coup. Plus, we have the first five months of this year's official figures. First five months is 10% over the first five months of the last year. So we do not really see this political issues has a huge impact on the foreign direct investment inflows. Whether that trend continues, perhaps in areas other than defence, is of course uncertain. The investment decisions are things that have been decided a long time ago and it takes a while for the tap to get turned off. Leo Martin of the Good Corporation again. But what we will see, I guarantee in the next five years will be a drop-off in investment activity and certainly a significant drop-off of new companies entering into Turkey or announcing new projects in Turkey. One reason for that confidence is his belief that as transparency increases, so will reputational damage. Companies increasingly will pay more attention to where they invest in the first place and more readily pack up and go when things turn sour. Big companies are in a battle to attract talent and how you behave is a really important factor. A number of companies, for example, who were caught up in the FIFA scandal in Qatar around the World Cup and Building of Stadia, said to us, well, we lost our graduate recruits. They didn't want to work for companies that were associated with human rights abuses or issues. Even if those companies would argue they didn't have any direct impact on the workers' conditions in Qatar, and that's why I'm positive. Here's hoping. But I feel I've heard that many times before. Business is about grabbing opportunity before the next company does, taking risks. These days it can mean getting a clear run at a deal by operating in places that make rivals squeamish or even fearful. They say that fortune favours the brave. If you're the last business left in town with a competition departed, you may be able to name your price. But there might also be a price to pay. town with a competition departed, you may be able to name your price. But there might also be a price to pay, staying on when risks mount may end in disaster for many companies. That is what happened to Bill Browder in a very extreme way. Three years after he was put on a plane and deported, he heard the dreadful news that his lawyer Sergei Magnitsky had been killed in his Moscow prison cell following 11 months in detention. And this event changed the course of Browder's life. I actually have ended my money management career completely. I'm a full-time human rights activist. That's a full-time activity. Bill Browder was the driving force behind the Magnitsky Act intended to punish Russian officials responsible for the death of his lawyer. It was passed in the United States in 2012. Looking back, what does Browder regret? That he stayed in Russia too long after lines in the sand had been crossed, or that he took the risks and enjoyed the rewards of going there in the first place. If I had to do it all over again, I wouldn't have gone to Russia knowing what I know now. I mean, I made an absolute fortune for my investors and made a lot of money for myself, but the tragedy that the number of people's lives that were ruined because of what happened with me, I would never repeat that experience again. Music Yoga is more than just exercise. It's the spiritual practice that millions swear by. And in 2017, Miranda, a university tutor from London, joins a yoga school that promises profound transformation. It felt a really safe and welcoming space. After the yoga classes, I felt amazing. But soon, that calm, welcoming atmosphere leads to something far darker, a journey that leads to allegations of grooming, trafficking and exploitation across international borders. I don't have my passport, I don't have my phone, I don't have my bank cards, I have nothing. The passport being taken, the being in a house and not feeling like they can leave. World of Secrets is where untold stories are unveiled and hidden realities are exposed. In this new series we're confronting the dark side of the wellness industry with the hope of a spiritual breakthrough gives way to disturbing accusations. You just get sucked in so gradually and it's done so skillfully that you don't realize. And it's like this, the secret that's there, I wanted to believe that, you know, that whatever they were doing, even if it seemed gross to me, was for some spiritual reason that I couldn't yet understand. Revealing the hidden secrets of a global yoga network. I feel that I have no other choice. The only thing I can do is to speak about this and to put my reputation and everything else on the line. I want truth and justice. And for other people to not be hurt for things to be different in the future. To bring it into the light and almost alchemise some of that evil stuff that went on and take back the power. World of Secrets, Season 6, The Bad Guru. Listen wherever you get your podcasts."}
