That ain't a GI Joe, that's a GI jerk with a kung fu grip that don't even work. I'm Rick Edwards, and this is Fighting Talk. Hello, good morning and welcome. As we approach Christmas and the end of 2024, I felt like a good time to reflect upon my first full 12-month stretch at the Fighting Talk Helm. And I have to say, it just goes to show how well I've done this year, knowing that myself, I have changed the sport of hosting a Saturday morning panel show. Oh, all the guests, sure, but I've played such a big part in it. Luke, I feel like you're being so modest. You've inspired so many people. How does that make you feel? Well, stop calling me, Luke, for starters. But I just know how big the sport of hosting a Saturday morning panel show has got. How quickly the listeners are downloading the show from BBC Sounds. It just goes to show how much I've changed it. You certainly have. I really have. And that is me being modest. So who is in for some occasionally amusing sports punditry this week? First up, on for the sixth time. But the first time, as a returning winner. And the first time he's been on with the same host, having had five different arbiters in his first five shows, somebody likes me. Comic, Spurs fan, vegan! Wrong intro. There he is. Carl Donnell is here. Morning, Carl. Hey, everybody. It's nice to be back. It's lovely to have you back. Genuinely this morning, I had avocado on toast in a cafe, classic. And it had bean sprouts on it, and I had genuinely thought of you. I don't know. I just imagine Carl would like this. I think that has an insult. Yeah, yeah, you should do, yeah. Well, it's nice to have you here. On for Show, yeah. Well, it's nice to have you here. On four, show, 123. Only one win away from a career 40 victories, joining a very elite list of just five other fighting talkers. He is the dapper Scotsman. Always good for three answers, when one is literally all over asked for. Doggy Anderson. Morning, Jackie. Good to be here, mate. Congratulations on your Anas Mirabalus. Well, thank you. Someone had to say, and it's you, and you've got a point. For another point, could you name the other fighting talkers with 40 wins or more? So there's five of them. I'll give you a clue. It's not the most diverse list you've ever heard. Bunch. Bunchy, yeah, tick. It's not Jim White. No. It's not Jim White. It's not Jim White. No, it's not Jim White. He started off with promising. Greg Brady's got to be. Greg Brady's in. Okay. I will give you the points if you can get three out of five. Bob Mills. Bob Mills. Absolutely. I will give you the point. John Rowling and Martin Kellner. Yeah. Yeah. Two, two, Two centre halves, I always think, of the fighting talk game, those two. Yeah, and they would take that as an insult. Interesting point. When I was asking who these were, I noticed that Bob Mills auto-corrects to Bob Milks, which is a kind of show he probably would have presented in the 1990s. Now, we've had a late personnel change, but not a late intro change. So just the same intro in the 1990s. Now, we've had a late personnel change, but not a late intro change. So just the same intro for the wrong person. Looking for his third straight win, QPR, Brombie and Minnesota Vikings fan who writes the best stuff in the Telegraph Sports section, but we also said to Jim White when he's on. Hold that thought. Tom Gibbs is ill, but Jim White is here. Hello, Jim. He has the same show, why? No, no, it's just I had the intro for Tom. Oh, Jim. He has the same show, why? No, no, it's just I had the intro for Tom. Oh, I see. Oh, sorry. I just didn't bother to why he had the same trail. No, no, no, I just didn't bother to rewrite the intro. Okay, fair enough. All right. It was a very, it was a late. I get the jokes. I'm sorry, Rick. Point of it. Unbelievably slow, Jim. But a straight telegraph for telegraph swap here. So it's like for like. I know you won't have had very long to prepare yourself, but you strike me as a man who is always ready, Jim. Always there. Always waiting. Boy Scout throughout my life. Never busy. And on for the 14th time. And I'll be frank. Need to win. Never yet experienced a thrill of victory on a fighting talk. How much longer can just being a famous and hugely successful netballer be enough? Another day, hopefully. Well, we'll see. Tam's in Greenway. You've played in eight grand finals. You've won eighth as either a player or a coach. But I just think to guarantee longevity, you need a fighting talk win, don't you? I know, but you keep on with Dougie. And I'm here with longstanding victory over here, 40 wins or something crazy like that. No, 39, 39. Yeah, but looking for that, bring up that big 40. Also, the way that he just sort of unscrewed his water and then smugly sit through it, and I eyeballing you was incredible. Exactly the kind of thing I'd like to see. All right, let's get on with it then, for the love of all things sacred. So listen to this. You better watch out. You better not cry. That's lovely. It gets you in the mood. So it is under a week now until Santa Claus comes to town. But unlike the man with the reindeer and the big white beard, I don't care about who's been nice. Tell us who's been naughty? I was going to read out another liner and I think I'm not going to. So who has been naughty? I'll stop with you, please, Dougie. Ange post to Coglu, obviously. Not just naughty, but downright obstinate. Now, he just willingly comes out with anything to royal journalists and broadcasts, aren't they? I mean, this week, the classic, he's labelled Fraser Foster, outstanding. Now, let's be there. Foster does not have a good first touch for a big man. But this in turn... Exactly the first touch you expect of a big man. Yeah, yeah. This in turn, of course, brings us to the 2004 movie Sean of the Dead. Absolutely. Inevitably. You know, did good box office not just in the UK, but in the US. And of course, features a joke that dogs can't look up. And of course, dogs can look up. But Ange can't. I mean, replace dogs for post-a-coglu. Any interview, the eyes are down, the eyes are down. He's a good man. he's a competent man. Take some basic media training son. Come on. I think he's the absolute definition of naughty but nice for me. Jim. It's Kyle Walker. He's had an interesting time off the pitch this year. He's been very generous with his... Nightmare around Christmas for him, I imagine. A very difficult. A lot of admin. A lot of legal fees to be paid and so on. But the problem he's had this year is that that kind of emotional heft that he takes off the field has started to come on the field. No longer can he stick to one person on the pitch. And particularly when that one person is the opposition winger, he can't do it anymore. Yeah, I mean, look, we were talking about this on breakfast this week, actually. I think that Five Live gave him the kiss of death when they made him do a podcast call, you'll never beat Karl Walker. And now, literally, everyone beats Carl Walker. Tam's in. So this is England Netball. So the whole governing body. Look, back in the summer, netball had a whole revamp, a professional era. Netball 2.0. Yeah, Netball 2.0. New teams, bigger venues, all games to be shown live. Last week, they added a new rule change. And you can just imagine how it went down. The netball world in complete and utter meltdown. Coaches came out, publicly slammed it. All the super fans absolutely hate it. And is it that you can use your feet now? Is that the way? No, it's still not basketball. It's a super shot. So you can score two points in the last five minutes of each quarter. It's played out in Australia already. Look, for disclosure, I'm all. I quite like it. Yeah, exactly. I'm all for it. But look, no super fan likes change. Right. So we know this. However, just for once, netball is not nice. They've been bold, they've been brave. Finally, netball is naughty and I'm all in. And that's what we want. And Carl, someone naughty, please. I'm going to have somebody's probably had a bit of a shalacking on this show already this year, but I'm going to go for Raygun, the Australian break dancer, not just content with ruining the summer. She's also coming for a late end of year run at it by she's just been involved in legal wrangling in Australia. A comedian called Steph Broadbridge registered a show at the Sydney Fringe last month called Ray Gun the Musical, and Raygun started legal proceedings to make it go away. And she's then invoiced the venue for $10,000 of legal fees. And she's now a pariah again. And I just feel like she should, you know, for somebody who, I think she should have lent into the being a bit of a laughing stock. You know what I mean? I think she would have been more popular if she would have gone, yes, look, it was rubbish. But also endorse the musical. Yeah. Become a bit more popular. Get involved. Be in it. Be in it. Do your own one. No one better. All right. Question number two then comes from you, the listeners, who are posted on our social media channels, fighting talk 316, on X, still resolutely on X, and FT316 on Facebook. This week's question two comes from James Patterson. Morning, James. Morning. Now, I've told you, don't want to two comes from James Patterson. Morning, James. Morning. No, I was told you you don't want to bring attention to the Y in your name, James, and I will, of course, respect that. It does lose your point, though. This is your, yeah, he sounds happy about that. Here's your intro music. Because you're a Leeds fan, frankly, our production team are hungover. We have gone quite rude one. It is fine, isn't it? What would you like to ask, James? I'm also going to go Route 1. It's Christmas time, Time of Miracles. So what's your favourite sporting miracle? You know, someone had to ask it, and I'm glad you have, James. And I'm going to start with Tams in, I think. Sporting Miracle. Okay, this is the miracle of baseball. I'll take you back to 1969 when the New York Mets won the World Series. So up to this point, overshadowed by the Yankees and they'd finished no higher the 9th out of 10 in the previous seven seasons. I have no idea how they do it and clearly no one else does because when they turned it around in 1969 and won the World Series, they were named the Miracle Mets. Yeah, it's a solid answer. Dougie. Well, for those of a literary bent, the book, The Miracle of... Relish saying that quite so much, please. He's gone right in the face. He gets a point. It's Christmas. He's flushed. The miracle of Castel de Sangro is one of the greatest sports books of the last two, three decades, all about a small Italian football team who made it to Seria Bay and it charts their progress in 96-97. But of course, from a non-literary bent, it has to be the 2012 Ryder Cup, the miracle that Medina, or Medina, if you will, which saw not one of the greatest golfing comebacks, one of the great sporting comebacks of all time. And then after all, Captain Josie Maria Lathabao dedicated the victator's great friend, Savi by Asteroz, who died the year before. He got emotional, he started crying, the viewers started blubbing everything you want in a sporting miracle, a sporting miracle that remains the miracle at Medina or Medina, if you will. Yes, I will. And that was just a textbook, Douggy two answers there. Jim? Yeah, a miracle. It was only two, not three, really. Yeah. This is less the fairy tale of New York and more the miracle of flushing meadow it is Emma Radicano winning the US Open in 2021 the first qualified to do so absolutely magnificent beautiful tennis completely superb why was it a miracle because a miracle is a one-off it only happens once and what has happened to Emma Radicano? Subsequently, nothing. A lot of sponsorship deals. Okay, Carl, I'm going to take you back to 1988. Thank you. Calgary, which I think is in Canada, but I didn't check. It's somewhere cold, we know that. The Winter Olympics. And this is a miracle that I thought was a bigger miracle. It turns out once I googled it. It's not actually as big as it was. You've seen the film Cool Runnings. Let's think about the Jamaican bobsleigh team. And the miracle of them showing, not only just showing up, but showing out how good they could be. But then since I've checked the results, they actually were rubbish. They finished almost bottom in both of their first two runs. Third one they crashed out. They didn't bother with the fourth. So it was what I thought was a miracle that turned out to be in that absolute failure. Exactly as expected. They were no good. Okay, James, you've got baseball, you've got several answers you can choose from from Dougie, you've got Emma Radicanu or you've got the Jamaican bobsleigh team in 1988 who are you going to give the points to well it's again a route one answer but it's got to be the miracle of Medina for me oh he's going straight for one of Dougie's answers thank you thank you James and as ever at this time of year i wish your christmas to be a happy and a holy one there we go and that's how easily you can lose points. And what are you doing this weekend, James? Frantically, Christmas shopping, of which I have done, ordered one thing a couple of weeks ago, which hasn't arrived yet. Well, look, James, I'm glad I asked. Have a great Christmas. Cheers. Merry Christmas. All right, let's have a bit more Christmas music for pity's sake. No? Yes. Very bits we travel so far. Now this is like Christmas itself. It is guaranteed to come around once a year. One of the oldest fighting talk chastnuts. Who are the three wise men, all women of sport? Carl. I'm going to go for Keene Wright Neville. Three players. Who would have thought they would end up three elder statesmen, widely respected men? Because you'd argue when they were playing, if they didn't play for the team you supported, you absolutely hated them. And so a lot of people talk about you know sort of the sports watch I see I don't know I think I mean I'm a Tottenham fan you're a Tottenham fans you can't judge and he had a bit he had a bit of nastiness in him right here as well to be fair and he was a horrible guy and I hate it but what I'm saying is like you know people talk about sports washing in a sense of big, you know, sort of the Middle East and things. I actually think that podcast they've done is the biggest act of sports washing in terms of it's laundered their reputations. Yeah. And I think we should go back to disliking them and being partisan. You know, I miss the old days. Yeah, it's massively worked on me. I hated at least two of them. I get friends, Tottenham friends, sending me clips of Ian Wright saying, look, how funny he is. Blocked. And actually, Carl now doing the Duggy Redface. Fuming. Jim. So, what gifts do they bring? So, Serena Vigman, for continuity, I have to say that at least twice in every show. So Serena Vigman will bring gold, well, silverware, at least. I once stood very close to him, and he smells absolutely lovely. So David Beckham will bring frankincense. And I don't know what myrr is, but it sounds like the French term for excrement, doesn't it? I've always thought of it as that. I sort of think it's a strange gift. Obviously, Gianni Infantino, who spreads myr across the football world. I mean, a weird answer, but I think I quite enjoyed it. Tam's in. I've gone for the three very wise women of Jordan Charles, Jade Carey and Sunny Lee, who backed Simone Biles and joined her at the Paris 2024 Olympic Games. So all three of these were veterans. Neither of them had to come back to compete again. But all three wanted redemption. And redemption they got, they turned out at the Paris Olympics. They won gold in the team event and it's pretty much gone down as the greatest gymnast US team ever. Yeah, very wise. And Dougie. I feel they need to go literary again on this one. Say it. Say it. Say it. I feel I have another literary bent coming. There we go. Blood rushing to the face. With an added sojourn of documentary filmmaking, there was a book published this year called Too Good to Be Forgotten Three Wise Men Men from Football's Golden Era, all about the stories of Brian Clough, Bobby Robson and Laurie McMenemy and the impact they had on sport and in their communities. I mean, literally none of them forgotten, but, you know. Absolutely not. Absolutely. But it deserved a book. Yeah, okay. And for fans of triumvirate storytelling, let's not forget the 2020 Johnny Owen film, The Three Kings, the makers of modern football, all about the achievements of Matt Busby, Bill Shankley, and Joch Steen, a film which actually incorporates footage of Hibbs beating Real Madrid in 1964, the same year that the Rolling Stones had their first number one with It's All Over now. Coincidence? I don't think so. As expected, six wise men. Let's check in. Oh, listen to that. Horrible. The scores. Jim is too loud. Is it just me that I don't like it? Jim and Tamzin tied on 10. Come on, Tamzin. You need this. Tide on 10. Carl on 11. Dougie after, frankly, charming James, don't mention his Y, on 30. And this is also too long. Incredible. Question number four. Live on 5 live tonight. it is the big one, the big fight, Fury Uc too. Fury's coach Sugar Hill Stewart has suggested that John Fury might not be in his son's corner for this rematch. If you were a boxer, who would you least like as your corner person? So it's a massive if I think for everyone because none of us look like boxers. Start with you please, Dougie. And just the four people that you wouldn't like him. Phil Foden. He just constantly looks worried, doesn't they? He's just got... Am I head on points? He's got the look of a man that says, I don't know if I paid that water bill. They're going to send a red letter the next time, aren't they? He just looks worried the whole time. If I'm getting my face pummeled, I don't want to look around and see his worried face in the corner. Yeah, just one. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Oh, lovely. Yeah, yeah. Tights. Yeah, almost a new year. A new way of doing. Tam's in. If I give you four, can I have more points? Is that bad? Well, let's see. I'll stick to my one. Louis Suarez, the guy literally doesn't know how to take a hit, so he wouldn't prepare you diving around. And he just loves to wind up the opposition. He'd literally get you battered. I don't know. I think he might motivate you a little bit, though. And the opposition. Yes, true. Jim. Well, one of Dougie's many answers was Ange Post-Soglu, but it was the wrong question, because clearly the last person to want in as your corner man is Ange. So round one, how's it going? I've been battered, mate. He keeps coming at me. He's hit me three times on the chin. Just stick to what you're doing, mate. No, no, we're not going to change it. Also, crucially, keep your guard low. Yeah, keep your arm down by the side. You know what you see? And I will punch out. Go for it, man. And if your guard as low as my gaze, you know what you say? I will punch out. Go for it, man. You not keep your guard as low as my gaze, that's what you'd say. And if you can play it out from the back, all the better. There's a good answer. Carl. It's a bit of a left field one, but Pelle. Okay. Okay. Obviously not for just the fact that he had no link to boxing. What by doing it? But also, you want somebody you can read it, make a good prediction what you need to do next. And famously, Pele, for somebody who was one of the greatest players of all time, had terrible, you know, predictions. He once said that Nick Barambi was going to be the next Roberto Baggio. And also his most famous bad prediction was the 1994 USA World Cup. He predicted Colombia were going to win. And obviously, that was famously the one they bottomed the group, and one of their players was murdered. So I feel like Pele is not going to be the best reader of a match. Just a time when I give you a point here, because I can't give it immediately after the murder. And now. Oh, thank you. There we go. Yeah. Okay. The final topic of the first half is all about this. The ball played in and now have a jello with a chance to win it. Oh, what a touch. What a touch from the long ball through. And from the tightest of angles, he slipped it in. And Manchester United can now celebrate turning this match right around. I love John Murray, but I hate the phrase he slipped it in. Fighting Talk store at Justin Morehouse posted a picture of himself in the away end at the Etty had. Showing his heart rate to be 120 when United scored that goal against Manchester City last weekend. I think that's just his resting heart rate. But when do you suspect that sport made your heart rate reach its maximum gym? Oh, poor old Justin. He's just got his heart rate. But when do you suspect that sport made your heart rate reach its maximum gym? Oh, poor old Justin. He's just got his heart rate down. He's listening to the show. And I put right back up again. He's gone again. Actually, nothing. I'm sure I speak for many people in this regard. Just completely unmoved by sport. Nothing sets your heartbeat racing quite like this. Tamzins, you've got this coming, than watching your children. this regard. Just completely unmoved by sport. Nothing sets your heartbeat racing quite like this. Tamzons, you've got this coming, than watching your children play sport. I mean, it's just ridiculous. So I used to coach my son's football team. And I was in misery every Sunday morning. A heartbeat. Like that. And, you know, he'd come over to me and he'd say, Dad, we're losing 4-0. No, mate, just stick to what you're doing. At least look me in the eyes, Dad. I can't. I can't. Anyway, they had an anniversary football match, the lads. You know, 15 years ago, they used to play together. They're an anniversary. They invited me along to watch. And it was back there. It was up there like this. And they were playing each other. Were you managing again? I was managing again, yeah. I was managing the team back there. It was up there like this. And they were playing each other. Were you managing again? I was managing again. Yeah. I was managing the team that lost. You'll be surprised to hear. Usually surprised. You lose another point, actually. Tam's in. Yeah. Well, so I had quite a few for this because obviously coaching. This is like the ultimate. And you talk about kids. My daughter's just become a shooter. So this is quite bad under 12's coaching. But it's not that. I've actually gone for athletics for this because I do remember 2004, the 100 metre finals in Athens, and Jason and Gardner was up to run in, and he used to train at Bath. So it was a big name around here, so I'm doing some name dropping. But we were all getting ready for a big night out, and I remember this coming on, and we weren't going out until we watched it. It only lasted 37 seconds. However, those 37 seconds were incredible. They beat the US team by 0.01 seconds. And I just can remember it's all jumping around, shouting at the telly. Is that the Mark Lewis Francis? On the ankle leg, big chest doing it. Love that. Absolutely love it. Dougie. Well, most recently, this month in fact, the month of Advent, saw me. I don't know what you're looking around for approval for that. I don't know what I did look at Carl. You really did and Carl was like, yeah. As I'm saying to Carl, Advent fan out. Saw me playing December the first it was. I remember like it was almost three weeks ago. There you go. Saw me playing sport for the first time for money. Now, it may add jeopardy to a game of golf, but it takes away the fun and it just increases the stress levels. I stood on the 18th, heart beating faster than it should for a man in his 20s, showby's age. With that inner voice saying, just don't go to pieces. Pulled my iron approach, three putted, went to pieces. As it turns out when 40 pounds is on the line, my composure melts. Carl, my composure melts. Carl, my... A bit of advent fan. But I, 2005, me and my friends went to the Galway races in the West of Ireland. I'm not particularly adept. I'm not into horse racing. I don't really gamble much. But we just went for the fun. In one hour period, I drank four pints of Guinness and also drank 11 oysters. I don't think eating doesn't sound like the right word. But drank didn't either did it somehow? No, I know. It all feels good. Yeah, I slurped. Took your slurts. Yeah. Took in oysters. We then we had a whip round. We all put 10 euros in and we put it all on one horse each way. We didn't know what we were doing and it won. We went on a five winning streak. We ended up with thousands of euros. Wow. And then we'd all decided just next race we're putting it it won. We went on a five winning streak. We ended up with thousands of euros. And then we'd all decided just next race we're putting it on one to win. And we put it on one horse and after the first lap it was dead last. And then it started making a run. And it moved all the way up the pack and then it ended up in a photo finish. And we were all like having you know, heart palpitations. And then we lost. But it's like it's a nice story. It's a photo finish. And we were all like having, you know, just heart palpitations. And then we lost. But it's like, you know, it's a nice story. It's a true story. What a moment. What a moment. All right. Let's have a little check in with the scores. Jim trailing behind on 17. Thames are making a little bit of headway on 18. Carl on 19. Dougie three answers still out in the lead on 20. That is it for the first half. What a half, 26 minutes of talking. And we will be back with more talking in the second half after the news and the actual sport. Hello, welcome back to Fighting Talk and welcome back to our panel, Deck the Holes with Bows of Carl Donnelly, Jingle Dougie Anderson's, Tams and Greenway's coming to town, and I'm dreaming of a gym white Christmas. It's more pleased with those than I have any right to be actually. We are on the BBC Sounds app as well. It's me to you just join us on the radio. You can go now and listen back from the start and then you won't miss hearing Dougie's multiple answers. Onwards. Game change of time. Five points to be won and crucially to be lost. It was reported this week that 47% of companies do not hold Christmas parties if they do, around a quarter of staff have to pay for themselves. No such problem here on Fighting Talk. We've got a huge budget. So I want you to plan our Christmas party. Who else is coming? What should they bring? What are we doing? And where are we going? Tamsim, plan me a lovely party, please. Yeah, so we're flying off to Kansas City. Easy. We're off to watch the Chiefs. Travis Kelsey is in charge of the guest list, and you will find me mainly doing karaoke with Taylor Swift. It's actually pretty good fun. That's a good party. Yeah, I'm in for that. Jim, wow me with your party. Yeah, well, I was going to invite Sir Jim Radcliffe, but then obviously he'd cancel it, so we can't have him. So he's not... I'm not scrooge at my party. He's not coming. Obviously, Serena Vigman for continuity. Yeah, of course, yeah. Kelly Cates, because she got matched the day, which was magnificent and much, much admired. But... Don't put the boot in a bit there. Don't put the boot in, Jim. Sorry, man. You're saying about her eyes. No, I just saying, lovely eyes. Yeah, also can look up and down and across. So, you know, everything you want from an eye, in my opinion. And I just, the person, it's going back to what Carl was saying earlier. So how, who we got? So far we got, Serena and Kelly. I'm not got Jim Radcliffe going back to what Carl was saying earlier. So how did we got? So far we got Serena and Kelly. I'm not got Jim Radcliffe. No. Got Kelly. Yeah. And then going back to what Carl was saying, I'm for Roy Keene, for the banter. And I'm going to host it in the car park at Portman Road because he often likes to go there. Yeah, I mean, it's a funny old evening, I think. Dougie. Is there any worse type of fun than the fun that is forced? I ask you. Now, I'm not going to get into the whole thing about wearing Christmas jumpers. That's Pass A, but I will see. I mean, that's literally well. But he's got a comedy twist, which is good, because I believe you're a successful stand-up meeting, that's, look. Yeah, I mean, like, it literally well. Carl's with, yeah, but he's got a comedy twist, which is good, because I believe you're a successful stand-up meeting, of course you are. And Advent fan. But I did see a man in a coffee shop this week wearing Christmas trousers, and he should be deported for that. So, consequently, no. But where, too? Where are you deporting to? I'm taking you there now. No Christmas attire will be worn. Everyone on this panel is invited as long as they're in their civbies. Yes. Now, the evening is simple yet effective. If nobody's mucking about, we meet in the pub around the corner from the steakhouse for something I like to call ails. It's then to the restaurant for a steak dinner augmented by wine with a body that simply commands respect. It's so horribly pleased me. There's no turkey, there's no crackers. Why's Dougie stroking the wine against? No crackers, just sporting anecdotes, the odd diatribe against FIFA and modern pricing, hops for the new year, hops for the new year, and cognac. We all go home and we go again in 2025. Yeah. I mean, it's one of the most basic parties I've ever heard. Carl. Right. As a man now approaching mid-40s with a child, I want to keep it boring. You know what I mean? Yes, please. So we're going to my house. We want it done by 10, right? So I'm inviting a list of people. I don't think we'll be going past that. So we've going to my house. We want it done by 10, right? So I'm inviting a list of people I don't think we're going past that. So we've got Jordan Henderson. He's on the list. Yes. Michael Owen. Gariff Barry. I do not want Michael Owen anywhere near my party. Harry Kane. Paul Skoles. I want people showing up with like a four pack of ale. That's all I want. I don't want Jimmy Bullard showing up. Ruining my house. You know, I want James Milner showing up with a frozen pizza to put in the oven. That's a bottle. A fellow aleman. You should come to my party. So just to be clear, my offerings are a car park with Roy Keene and Serena Vigman and Jim, a steakhouse with a lovely bodied wine. And your civvies. And just chuntering away in our civvies about the things we don't like in sport. Going to Carl's house and got to be in bed by 10 or going to Kansas to singing karaoke with Taylor Swift. I mean, listen, it doesn't feel like it's a match for a competition there. The points are all yours, Tamsin. So the five points you've won. Who do you want to take him from? And you can do a spread here if you would like. You'd have to take all five from one of them. I can do a spread. You can do a spread. Two from Dougie. Two from Dougie. I'm going to take two from Jim because he was at the bottom. So I'm going to leave my odds and then one from car. And then one from car. And that is absolutely superb gameplay. It has put you in the lead. It has put you in the lead. Strategic coaching right there. Let's have a quick little look at the scores. Jim now as well still just trailing behind in 18, making small talk with Kelly Cates over by the machines that are now redundant because everyone pays for their parking on an app. Dougie and Carl tied on 21. Tamzin now absolutely streets ahead on 26, gunning for that first ever fighting talk victory. That for the first time ever worked well timing-wise. Now back to the big fight tonight. The rematch, Tyson Fury, looking to avenge his first ever defeat against Alexandre Usik earlier this year. Expectations are high. But what are the other sporting occasions where the sequel has bettered the original? I think this is a good question. Carl, I'm going to go for another Tyson. I'm going to go for Tyson-Hollifield 2. You know, a fight less known for the sweet science, more for the sweet cannibalism involved, where basically the first fight was such a shock. Everyone thought Tyson was going to walk it. Holyfield absolutely outboxed him, stopped him in the 11th. So Tyson came back, having had quite an interesting training camp. A lot of buffets. A lot of Bill Tongue, building up his jaw, came in and obviously we all know what happened next. Yeah, well, he came in looking hungry, to be first, for the guy. Dougie. I'd like to replace the ring with the track. We're talking rematches here with a healthy dollop of elite sporting gazumping. Moscow Olympics, 1980, Ovet Co. British middle distance rivalry. A type of rivalry that just does not exist anymore. They faced each other firstly in the 800 metres final. Coe was favourite, Ovet won the gold. Then the rematch in the final of the 1500, Ovet's preferred distance, odds on to win. Coe pulls something out the bag, wins it. Everyone thought, that's the drama of the Olympics in 1980 over. It wasn't, of course, a few days later, Alan Wells won the 100 metres gold, yet, inexplicably, wasn't even placed at the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Awards, won by Robin Cousins, a figure skater. In better news, though, in better news, Alan Wells does remain the only ever Olympic gold medalists to appear in a Bell and Sebastian video. I'm a cuckoo. And also, I think Alan Wells, in winning that, he just about nipped under 11 seconds, so it was a quick race. Tamzin, have I asked you? Nope. I'll ask you now, then. Thanks. For years, Australia and New Zealand have dominated the netball world. So I'll take you back to 2010, the Commonwealth Games final in India in Delhi. Australia leading, New Zealand came back. It went to extra time, which is unheard of in netball. Still tied at the end of extra time. It went into golden goal. New Zealand coming out on top by two points. No one ever thought they'd see a game like it again, except 12 months later, the netball World Cup in Singapore. Exactly the same finalists, exactly the same outcome. It goes to extra time. This time, Australia, pipping it on the final whistle. It was incredible scenes for any netball fan and the best sequel. The only thing that would have made it better? A super shot. Jim. This is like Furius in that it happened much quicker than expected, the second telling of this story. And it had never happened before in FA Cup final history. The same two teams get to the final, Manchester United and Manchester City. And the assumption was the second time around that the favourites will get a walk it. They were going to flatten it. But they didn't. Manchester United won. Just in More House's heart rate went into orbit. A quite magnificent day for all people who believe in truth and honesty and not 115 other things. It does make me think that Eric Ten Haug should have mentioned that. If only he did, I think he might still be in the job. He might have kept his job. He should have mentioned it. What an error. Well said. Right, let's stop that and move on to our next question. More festive fare actually. And I want the worst sporting Christmas gift you've ever received. And I will give bonus points if you name and shame the giver. Tamzin. So this is a secret Santa at work. So I still don't know who gave me the present. However, they bought me a netball. Yeah. I mean, frankly the last thing you need. Literally. I have a bag of balls in every single cupboard car that I own. And they bought me in that. Plus, it wasn't well hidden, you know, it just came in a round paper bag, brilliant. Have you seen that clip of Col Palmer unwrapping a present? And it's very clearly a football and a person who's asking to unwrap it. Can you guess what it is? He just goes, football. It's just, it's exactly what you want for Col Palmer. Absolutely football. Jim. Where is it now? goes football it's just if it's exactly what you want for Carl Palmer at football uh Jim where is it now times in that netball probably in one of the other bag of balls that I own yeah how many how many balls do you think you own ballpark quite quite a lot probably probably probably about over over 30 oh yeah I'll give you a point for that Jim um I don't know if you've seen it but it's called head basketball. And you have these little things that you put on your head, little plastic things you put on your head. The net? You chuck balls at each other. Yeah. And we had it at last Christmas. Do you have to stand still if you're the net? No, no. If you're trying to catch it. You're trying to catch it. Oh, you're trying to help you. I don't know. I don't know, Rick, because we had two head nets. And when both were put on, they both broke. And we never even threw a ball at them. Really, really disenfranchis. It reeks of forced fun that, does. Yeah. You know where I stand on that. Yeah. I can imagine Roy Keene popping one of those on in a car park in Ipswich, though. It was right. You gave it to us. So I don't know what you asked who gave it to us all right. The one saving grace there is that I think you would look like a right wally with that head metal. Dougie. In retrospect the worst prison ever gave was some Newcastle United shower gel which I did buy in Sports Direct at the time when Mike Ashley was, yeah. Oh, man. Who did you give it to you? It was to my brother-in-law, but now he's my ex-brother-in-law, so don't feel good at all. Result. Absolute result. But as far as receiving, it would have been a Viv Richards endorsed cricket bat, which I was given as a child by my brother, with the caveat that it was already broken, found in the street, and possibly contained woodworm. I think street gifts are quite good, actually. I saw it and I thought, have you? Which ever way you look at, the 1980s, a more innocent time. Did it have woodworm? It did, yes. Yeah, well, that's a little added bonus. I remember father saying, that doesn't come in the house, Douglas. Well, now you're going to use it outside, clearly. Carl. When I was eight years old, my aunt, who's Irish, bought me a Liverpool kit. Because she was aware that I was a football fan. And she just assumed that meant you could buy any shirt. So she it to me I was like I dare you go currently I know you like football yeah but I don't support football do I but maybe you should I don't think oh it just hope the best team wins so and I had to put it on and in the 80s that was Liverpool yeah I had to put it on to like you know, a shower. And then it was like, it was like giving a vampire garlic. I hated it. Why isn't it smiling? There is actually a photograph of me in it. That's which I've been trying to sort of remove from all the records my entire life. Well, I'm a big fan of that, obviously. Now, a bit more Christmas music. What should we have? Let's have a bit of this. What I'm interested in, and you can take this anywhere you like, really, is who or what in sport most embodies Christmas to you. Dougie. Christmas. Yes. It's a good start. Next question. Christmas. I tame off. It's good stuff. Next question. Christmas. A time of... Don't milk it. A time of fantasy when reality can be forgotten. Perhaps, if you will, an embargo on common sense. Let's call it ridiculousness. A bit like referring to Twickenham by its official name, the Allian Stadium. Utter nonsense. The RFU to this day won't let any other sport be played at that stadium. But stupid naming rights, on you go, sir. Yeah. So that's your answer, the RFU? I couldn't quite walk out where you were. Twickenham. Twicken them. Yeah. Twicken them in. Okay, fine. I know it's root one and a bit obvious, but yeah, the spirit of Christmas. Yeah, fine, fine. I know it's root one and a bit obvious, but yeah, the spirit of Christmas. Yeah, fine, fine. Tam's in. Okay, well, Jim, you kind of stole my answer, but I'm letting you off because you were a latecomer into this. But we're going to go back to Emma Radicano. Obviously, she won 10 games in a row at the US Open in 2021 to become the youngest ever British tenets player to win a major. And arguably, just like my greatest ever Christmas song, it was The Fairy Tale of New York. Lovely eyes as well. Yeah, I just and can look up and down and across. Just loads a point because obviously Jim had already given the answer. Jim. Well, Christmas spirit is about generosity, kindness, public spirit. And I'm going to go for the former Celtic, Manchester United and Scotland forward, Lou McCarie, who for the past 10 years has been running a shelter for homeless people in Stoke. And it's absolutely fantastic. It's in an old warehouse and they've got these little shelters inside it and he's there every day helping them on and so on. And for some reason, and I cannot understand this, every new year there's an honours list and Lou Macari is not on it. Let's start a campaign here, Rick. Here we go. Let's start a campaign here. Get Lou Macari on that honours list. It's probably too late. It was probably all decided ages ago. But what a nice man. What a kind man. What a decent man. What a generous man. I mean, look, I don't know if you do feel ashamed, Dougie, but that was a proper answer to the question. What a lovely answer. And you're giving out Twickenham. It was a good answer, and I will answer your other question. Of course, I feel ashamed on a daily basis. Carl. Oh, you feel ashamed. I've got to follow that answer up by saying Fraser Forster. The shipping two goals against the menu. We just heard about somebody who deserves an M-P-E. And there's me going, oh, he gave away a couple of dumb goals. But anyway. Go on, car. There we go. Fraser 4 star. Giving out two free Christmas turkeys to Manchester United this week. Yeah, tough coming off the back of blue. I've got to say. All right. A little check in with the scores, if we can. Now, this is quite exciting for Tamzin. Jim, still training behind on 29. Dougie and Carl, neck and neck on 31. Tamzin, I don't think you can throw this away from here. Maybe you can. 36, five points clear of the pack. The Peloton are chasing, but they look knackered to me. Bobby Gould holds the all-time record 14 shows without a win. That may well be safe. We will find out. Right, a one fixture round. There are 40 Premier League games in 17 days. It's a wonderful time of year for sports fans. But what is the one festive fixture You Will Not Miss We'll start with Doggy I think It's great that there are fixtures on Boxing Day Too much family nonsense the day before Especially by those Who insist on playing Christmas music On Christmas Day. Give it a rest, there's been enough in the lead-up. And we get the idea, we know. It's the day now. Yeah, yeah. I refuse to miss the early kickoff on Boxing Day, or as I like to call it, a brief sojourn back to normality during the silly season. This year it's Man City versus Everton, so there's comedy potential in this game for a kickoff, isn't there? Just imagine sitting in a pub, pint in hand, just having a little Yuletide timeout with a 1230 kickoff. Delicious. And Tam's in. Yeah, so I actually enjoyed the family festivities on Boxing Day, so I'm happy about this fixture. Lester Liverpool at 8 o'clock. Being a Fox's fan, it means I can chill out with the family during the day, turn on this. And of course, Lester, this is their moment, isn't it? They're great when it comes to Christmas time to turning their season around. They're going to blow the title race wide open with victory away from home against Liverpool. Well, I certainly hope not. Jim. Yeah, there's a lot of great football going on. That'll be fantastic. City Everton, magnificent and so on. But I'm not even going. I'm not interested in football on Box today. There's only one place to be. That is the question I've asked you. For the racing. And it's fantastic. And unlike Carl, who we know is a fantastic tipper, I spend my time as Secret Santa. I go round, handing money over to blokes I've never seen before in my life, and they never hand any back to me. Do you say this is how many at Kempton Park? Yeah. Okay. Okay. Just check. So do that, no, no. These are the bookies, obviously. I see it, right. Sorry. Yeah, yeah, I think. Just trying to jotize across bands. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Is that, I stopped listening. You did, yeah. I completely, I was just, I don't know what they're talking about. Carl. I'm going to go for the darts. I mean, I think I've mentioned it on here before about my love of, you know, I've been, I've hung up my spurs. I don't go, you know, live anymore because it is, you know, it's based like going on a 10,000 man stag do. But I, but I just, it's a good thing to watch over cricket. I've been to both. I've been to PDC. I've been to BDO, very different beasts. BDOs like, you very different beasts BDO's like you know if you go I'm a BDO man I love it's a lot of rent it's a more family fun but like if you go to watch the PDC and then go to watch BDO and like it's like watching that L classicalo yeah yeah it's like Guiton and Mitch and BFC white leaf but both fun in their own way yeah yeah course so you don't go for the quality at a BDO no sure sure sure um Houten and Mitchon versus FACC Whiteleaf. But both fun in their own way. Yeah, yeah, of course. So you don't go for the quality at a BEDA. No, sure, sure, sure. All right. Before we do any other business, just a quick one. I mean, it's a ridiculous question, and it's a sort of thing we should ask on this show. Who is the Brussels sprout of sport? And I'll start with Tamzin. Mike Dean. Yeah, fine. Don't need to elaborate on that. Some you won't need to elaborate on, some you will. And Dougie? Everton. No, go on. Well, according to Tesco this week, Brussels sprouts are up 25% in size due to good growing conditions in the UK. Obviously, we knew that already. But since the takeover at Goodison by the Freakun Group, their fan base in America is literally expected to leap upwards to that same percentage. Another fantastic growing season. And Carl, I'm going to go for Jokim Lowe, former German manager. Just because, you know, I remember when he put his hand in his trousers and stuff out there. It's the main thing I remember about that, basically. It just gave off sprouting vibes. Just rearranging the old sprouts. And Jim. On the basis that Brussels sprouts crop up once a year, nobody likes them and nobody's quite sure what the point of them is, the boat race. Yeah, lovely. But yeah, we have got time for any other business. And, Tam's in, you can't,'t I mean you're in such a strong position unless you're any other business is terrible you're in the final here go on okay Nottingham Forest so first of all as a Lesothan it's painful to see them doing so well obviously they'll moaning this year about being cheated out results they then gave us Steve Cooper we didn't want him and of course now five months. And then they've got a new netball team. So I'm just opening up the beef right now. So we're coming for you, Nottingham Forest netball team. Okay, felt some trees. Jim. I was late replacements on this show. And, you know, I wasn't quite sure what I was going to get what I was going to do for any other business. So I gave Dougie a ring and, you know, he's the grinch of Christmas. He hates everything about Christmas. He said, well, why don't you go for Love Actually? And I just want to say here and now, Love Actually makes me sick, physically ill. A very fact it appears on the telly with relentlessness on Christmas Day just makes me vomit. And Richard Curtis, he made a film a bit later after Love Actually, which was called Yesterday, in which there was an electric storm, and for some reason, the whole of the Beatles cannon was wiped out. Every Christmas, I am praying for that electric storm. A wipe out, Love Actually. I have, I've got to say, I've never seen the film. But if the writing sort of falls off a bit, is there any chance you can make money as a Richard Curtis impersonator? I think there probably is. Carl, I'm going to go for boxing weigh-ins and face-offs. They've got just so long. Did you see the Furious? 11 minutes, 20 seconds. And it felt like 11 minutes. Yeah, yeah, that's probably longer than the fight could be. And I just feel like, you know, I know it sounds weird to say, they just go back to the old days, grow up and just punch themselves in their head. But like, you know, I preferred it when it felt less contrived back then, didn't he? Now it's all nonsense, talk, all this 11 minute stuff. And then they'll be hugging each other at the final bell and walking away with $20 million. Also, apparently, I've not watched the full 11 minutes in detail, but apparently Ousick doesn't blink. And that just makes my eyes feel like what's got to stink. You hate the thought of that. All comes back to the eyes. Yeah, can look down, can look up. We'll look straight at you. Dougie. That wasn't a weird answer, Carl, but it is a weird time of year. What an incredible segue. And I'll be back after the truck. Completely segue. And I'll be back after the travel. Don't you, not me! Now, chances are you might find yourself at a social occasion over the festive period struggling for conversation. My advice is go out on the front foot with the simple inquiry. Any particular highlights this year? Immediately puts the other party on the back foot while giving you the gift of time. Conversational tips from Dougie Anderson. It doesn't get better or worse than that, I think. Alright, let's have a look at the final scores. Jim, hang on, where is it? Here we go. No, not that one. Or do I want that one? No, I don't want that one. I want this one. Jim, yeah, rightly finishing last, 38. Carl, you have so narrowly missed out in the final there. 40 points. Dougie just nipping ahead with that fantastic seasonal advice on 41. Tamzin finishing ahead on 43. Dougie and Tamzin going to the head to head, defend the indefensible. Ridiculous statement, you must answer this. However much it hurts, if I say I, I mean you. Tamzin, extraordinary. You scored the most points. You will go first. You have 20 seconds on the following. Which one what do I want to do here? Oh yeah, I want you to do this one. All money raised by Christmas charities should be given to Manchester City to get them back to the top. Yeah, all money raised by Christmas charities need to go to Man City. Poor old Pep. Like, what is he doing? I mean, after the record breaking seasons he's had, he's now just absolutely lost the plot. He's going to need a bit of extra cash to really help him get back on track, getting some coach qualifications and getting back up there to help Man City regain their title. Not bad. I wouldn't have minded him buying a bit of Savlon for those scratches on his face, but apart from that, fine. Okay, Dougie, you have 20 seconds on this. My biggest hope for 2025 is that live, take over World Golf and get rid of all these out-of-date majors. The greatest thing that Liv has done is get golf not just on the back pages but on the front pages. The PGA, the Royal and Ancient, they're just mourning minis. It needs a rocket up the backside. Live is giving golf that and I say thank you for that rocket up the backside, Liv is giving golf that, and I say thank you for that rocket up the backside from the perspective of world golf. You've got my money. I mean, saying rocket up the backside twice. You know, it's a tough one, because on the one hand, Tamsin desperately needs this for her first ever win. Dougie desperately needs it to make the 40 club. I think, oh, it's tough, it's tough and at this time of year to break someone's heart, I'm gonna, I'm so sorry, Tamsie, I'm giving it to Dougie. I'm so sorry. This miracle. Yes, it is. Would have been a good answer, an extra point there. Well, congratulations. That will set you up for an absolutely terrific Christmas, Doug. The rest of you, I just hope you raise your games in 2025. Thank you very much for listening. This has been a World's End production for BBC Radio 5 Live. In the podcast Extra, we are going to be ranking the best British football managers today. After the news, it is Five Live Sport with Mark Chapman out in Riyadh. with Mark Chapman out in Riyadh. Hello, you're listening to the podcast extra of Fighting Talk. Just going through the archives, Tam's in. You do now hold the record equally with Bobby Gould for the longest losing street. 14 shows without a win. Just couldn't quite convert at the end there. Couldn't nail the super shot. I know, absolutely shocking. I mean, I'd like us to get rid of that stat, to be honest. It's quite a negative start to the show, isn't it, when you tell me I'm the last. I think, unfortunately, it is going to follow you around, I think. Yeah. I learned a lot today, though, watching Doug Ian defend the indivensible. Yeah, that was a lovely defend, actually. Oh, thank you. Yeah, it was. It didn't they say rocket out of the backside twice, but you made your point. Yeah, that was that was a lovely defend actually. Oh thank you. Yeah, it was it didn't they say rocket out of the backside twice but you made your point no that was superfluous but it gets you over the finishing line isn't it something? Yeah yeah and Tanzania felt like you I don't want to say you crumbled but it was a little bit I haven't had enough practice in that situation that's the problem. Is it worth in that period when you don't quite know what to do yourself between Christmas and New Year you're just practicing some sample defending and defensive you know what? That wouldn't be a good chat. I remember the last time, well the last time I was on here a couple of people like well do you not get gutted you're a sports person you know you're not really competitive and as I mentioned then I don't train all year to win fighting talk. But there's that's that's the problem. That is the problem clearly. What do you think Dougie does? Dave? Clearly. Yeah, I just ask indiscriminate people, just give me 20 seconds. Yeah. Two seconds on any of the AI studio at home that you work with. Every other question where you have a minute. Right. We're going to do Rick's rankings and it's based around the fact that Steve Cooper, Gary O'Neill and Russell Martin have all been sacked from their jobs. So now, a grand total of three English managers in the English top flight. Anyone want to name them? Jim, you can probably do this. Should be able. How, Dij. No, that's two. McKenna's Irish, you know? I don't know why I looked at Carlin. Because I knew you had an Irish grandmother. Well, obviously, Harold. I've abandoned my heritage. Yeah. You did the accent earlier, which I enjoyed. And you're allowed to do that. Well, I had McKenna down. British, maybe. Yeah, British. Because he is from the Nard. Yes, exactly. So I'm asking who are the top five British bosses? Who wants to start us off? I'll go with you, Dougie, please. It might not be the most fast, though, because I want to drop down the league to the championship, but you have to say Chris Wilder at Sheffield United. They are top. You know that thing when you go on the BBC website and they have the, I think it's the last five games Will and Lou's jaw. Green, green, green, green, green, green, there are nothing red. So, yeah, he is going, he is going brilliantly. Yeah, okay, so Chris Wilder. Tam's in. You know, I'm passionate about this because being in our sport, anybody foreign comes over from Australia and New Zealand as a coach, they're sort of, you know, idolised. Immediately Lord is. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So I think this is a big deal. I've gone for Eddie Howe. An obvious choice, but, you know, idolised. Immediately Lord is. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So I think this is a big deal. I've gone for Eddie Howe. An obvious choice, but you know, huge success at Bournemouth, two out of three promotions, named Football League manager of the decade. I mean, that's quite a title. Newcastle, took up final Champions League. And you know what I love about him is such a good people person. Yeah, and also essentially got all the money in the world. So I think currently sitting about 11th or something. So, yeah, good on him. Well, I think, currently sitting about 11th or something. So good on him. Well, you can make that face all you like, Mike. But it's true, isn't it? We can't spend it. Yeah. Oh, boo-hoo. Oh, no. It's like rob in a bank. And they say, obviously, don't go on a spending spree. You cannot put it under the bed and just leave it. Yeah, Newcastle are basically that scene in Goodfellows aren't they yes what did I say yeah you've bought Mbapay it's so obvious I want to come out senior Newcomb what the one thing I said Carl I'm gonna go from Michael Carrick yeah it's really's a really good. He's really, like, bedded in. He's a couple of good years. I think he's going to do well. I think it's going to come up, you know, potentially not this year, but next year I think they'll be in the Premier League under him. And I think he's going to be a very top manager over the next. I think a potential England manager down the line. You know, I'm calling it now. He's one of them good. You know, he's not like a sort of Lampard, you know, ex-midfielder who's actually a bit whiffy. I think he's just of them good you know he's not like a sort of Lampard you know ex midfielder who's actually a bit whiffy i think he's just solid good manager and jim i mean i'd be surprised and i think he would be if southgate doesn't even get a mention but he might not but we're talking uh you mentioned england managers i mean when thomas tucke got appointed everyone was going there's a discreet you know but actually if you look there are so few england uh english managers in the top flight. Possibly the two best Southgate and Potter aren't employed at the moment. Why aren't they? I don't know. But even if you look in the championship, there's only about four or five. There's Carrick, as you said. There's Wilders, as you said. There's Tom Cleverly at Watford, who's doing a really, really good job. And I go for him, he's doing a good job, you can tell at Watford, because he's been employed for more than six months. And at Watford, normally, you've gone. You've gone, unless you're doing a good job. And of course, let's not forget Steve Bruce of Blackpool. Well, I have forgotten him, he's not on the list. League one, mate. League one. So hang on, who have you gone for in the end? Cleverly? I just thought, no. I think Sean Dice, it's got to be because just I like the way he wears... A bit of a doggy style answer here from here. I'm going to say. I just like the way he doesn't wear any protective clothing. You know, there's pep in a bloody, you know, zip up and all this kind of stuff that he's being paid for. Sean Dice, it's absolutely freezing. He's just in a white shirt and colour and size. Yeah, and looks like he's ready for a tear up. I'm going to go, I think, quite controversial here. I was tempted by Will still because he is still doing well in France, and he's basically 23 or something, isn't it? But I am going to go for, hear me out, Russell Martin. Because, because, don't look at me like that. Because the football he wants to play is genuinely really good. And if he was in charge of a big club with top players, I think he do really well. And the other thing about Martin was that six months ago, everyone at Southampton thought he was a tactical genius. Oh, he's fantastic. He's not only going to get us, not only got us promotion, he's going to turn us into a wonderful football. And then last Sunday, I was watching them against Spurs, and they're all booing him. Yeah, but if he just hasn't got the players, he just hasn't got the players to play it. If he had the players, I think he did really well. Oh, he's got lovely eyes. Eddie Howell gets shunned, Russell Martin is the man. I think he did really well. He's got lovely eyes. Eddie Howe gets shunned. Russell Martin is the man. Yeah, that's, no, Eddie. Eddie, Eddie, Eddie, how is in. Eddie Howe is in. I think, I mean, genuinely, I think I could probably get Newcastle to mid-table obscurity. So, here we go. In no particular order, quite an unpopular list of the top five British managers. Ah, Chris Wilder at Sheffield United, Eddie Howse, Shaw at Newcastle, Michael Carrick at Middlesbrough, Sean Dyche. I mean, actually, I didn't really go on on Shaw Dyche. He's not exactly doing brilliant, is he? And then Russell Martin, who, to be fair, has just got sacked at this team aren't going to get relegated. Southgate didn't get a mention, you know, there's a few, up and this team are going to get relegated. Southgate didn't get a mention, there's a few. There's a few we probably feel a bit disappointed there. That is you lot for this week. Thanks very much, everyone. The Football Daily Podcast.
