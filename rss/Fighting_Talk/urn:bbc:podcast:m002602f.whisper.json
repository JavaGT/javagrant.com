Live enough, borrow time, the clock ticks faster. I'm Rick Edwards, and this is Fighting Talk. Good morning, hello and welcome. I had quite an elaborate intro about the World Cup going to Saudi Arabia in 2034, but that has been heavily redacted, so you just have to use your imagination. This week I was hosting a charity event because I'm a great guy, and a gentleman came over specifically to tell me how much he loves fighting talk. Meanwhile, someone online described the show as unlistnable nonsense. And it is that kind of mixed feedback that tells me we must be doing something right and presumably something wrong. Also, also, also, I've got to say this. So last week, we all got really giddy just shouting at every available and some to be fair, not available opportunity. And then we were talking, I think in the podcast extra, about how church would be enhanced if the vicar just threw in a few awogas. God saw everything that he made and behold it was very good. A wuga! And this week, a six foot nine pastor who says he's asked a question two on this show before, got in touch and said that if we go to his church, he promises to drop an awuga. I mean, I've never had a better offer in my life, so I want to get that organised. Slightly more pressingly, who is on this week, pathetically grubbing around for points. First up, the former Clyde, Chelsea, Everton, Tramere, Kilmarnet, Motherwell and Scotland player. Good hello. To... Patnever in. Hello, Pat. Hello, and you've still got my music. I love it. Still got your music. Would never let you down by replacing your music. Yeah, so do me a win by favour. Don't look at the league table in Hibirnian just now, okay? Okay, yeah. For you, anything, Pat. It's always a pleasure to have you on, although as a friend, I do feel obliged to say, I think this show is beneath you, Pat. I do, I think you're too, good for this show. You mean old, don't you? You mean old. That's not what I mean. That is not what I mean. Alongside Pat, former Watford, Liverpool, Villa, West Ham, Manchester City, Portsmouth, Bristol City, Bournemouth and England goalkeeper. Greeting innovator. Good hello. David. David. Hello, David. Good hello. Yes, good hello. It's always a pleasure to have you on too, although again, as a friend, I feel obliged to say that this show is probably about right for you. Oh. Oh, yeah, I'm happy that. That's an improvement. Yeah. I'm going in the right direction. Nestling between Pat and David, former SGR Colchester, the best music mix in North Essex, BBC Southern Counties, BBC Southeast Tele, BBC News, and now BBC Sport Broadcaster. Good hello. To Cat Downs. Hello, Cat. Hello. Do you imagine, Kat, that when you enter your twilight years, you will drift back to the comforting bosom of SGR CultureStown? I'd love it, but it doesn't exist anymore. That is a real shame. It is a real shame because I feel like the people of North Essex specifically are now criminally and served. Well, they're bereft, aren't they? They are. They're bereft. Well, it's very nice to have you here completing this absolutely stellar line-up, currently of the Comedy Store, the Frog and Bucket, the Beer Keller in Printworks, the Hot Water Comedy Club, and one of my favourite Chester comedians, who isn't Bob Mills, to hello, to Danny McLaughlin. Yeah, just in before you tell me I'm lucky to be here. Not at all, Danny. Not at all. Now, I wanted to ask you this because I was idly going through just watching some videos of you doing stand-up. Which I think is a nice thing to do, but given that we're sort of friendly, is it weird? I don't know. I don't know. I was enjoying it. Oh, okay. I have never put a stand-up clip out. Well, there's stuff out there. Yeah, it's other people. I just like, I don't know. I don't know. I was enjoying it. Oh, okay. I have never put a stand-up clip out. Well, there's stuff out there. Yeah, it's other people. I just like, I don't do it. I'm a shy man. If people put it out there, they put it out. Yeah, I'm scared of it. But it did provoke the question. Do you actually have an uncle called Russ Beauty? Absolutely not. I figured that you couldn't have, but you're so determined in claiming that you do, that I was momentarily, I thought that maybe you did. I've been told them a really good liar. Yeah, you are a fantastic liar and that will help in this show. All right, let's get down to the very serious business of me awarding points based honestly as much on how much I like you as the quality of your pundit. First up, a little bit of this. Lewis Hamilton kneels down next to his final car with Mercedes. His gloves are off. The patting you're hearing is him patting the side pod of the car. This is an emotional moment for Lewis Hamilton. The realization that he will no longer be a Mercedes driver. Yeah, we've all patted a side pod in our time. End of an era in Formula One with Lewis Hamilton driving for the last time for the team that he won seven world titles with. Sort of eight, really. And broke the record for most race wins, pole positions and podiums. Where else in sport might eras be nearing their end? I'll start with you, please, Kat. It's traditional, isn't it, on Fighting Talk, to give a mention to Torville and Dean. They're standing. Sorry, that really, that surprised me how loud that was. But yeah, good to hear it. You know, let's go back to 1984 and the Bolero and Sarajevo when they won the gold medal. That was 40 years ago this year. So they like a round number, Torval and Dean. They've announced that this is going to be their last season of dancing. They'll finish in 2025, which is 50 years on from their first dance together in Nottingham where they met. They'll perform their last performance in Nottingham where they're tying up all the strings, all the loose ends of this career. But Torval and Dean this week have announced that it is their last performance together next July. It's maybe a point of interest for me because I just assume that they had to skate for about 30 years. They're always skating. They're only just retiring. And I always assumed a four was quite pointy. So how's it round? What? 40 round number. That is absolutely terrible stuff from you. Try and redeem yourself with an answer now, David. Talking about long careers, I think everybody is in shock. The legend that is Andy Thompson, MBE, is retiring from international bowls. Yeah, I'm really. I'm absolutely really. Yeah, yeah. Well, Andy had a tremendous career represented in England, 100 and several times. Tony, I haven't got my glasses, but Tony, his mate, Tony said, I shall miss. Tony Alcock? Hobbin. Tony Hobrin said, I shall miss his driving determination. Yeah. This is, this is, I've seen some very poor presentation of answers. An A4 envelope folded into three is right up there. Thank you. Terrible writing as well. Danny. Gone with pep, like not actual pep. I think pep will always be about. But what I've gone with is aura pep. Like that invincible pep just seems to have gone now. They've got one winning ten. As soon as he started scratching his nose, you like that. He's scratching himself or like he's costing people scratching his nose. Yeah, he's scratching himself up. Like, he's costing people in the street. Like, even the car. He was getting accosting. Well, yeah, but you just walk on by Pep. And also, like, the cardies don't hit the same. Like, I think that's when you know when the managers, like, falling off a little bit. Is the dress doesn't look as good. It happened with Marino United, like, where he's, like, looking like he just got out of bed and that. The knitwear just slides off a little bit. Yeah, and it's the same with Pep. Like, I just, I don't look as good. It happened with Marino United, where he's looking like he just got out of bed and that. The knitwear just slides off a little bit. And it's the same with Pet. Like, I don't know about him. I'm a bit worried about him. But as you say, he will be fine. Pat. Right. The Messi Ronaldo era. Right. The problem is, it's gone, right. But they're not giving it up. That's killing me, right? Yeah. They're a Torval and Dina football, Pat. Ronaldo will do not giving it up. That's killing me, right? Yeah. They're a Tovlanda football pack. Ronaldo will do anything and stay on as long as he can to get more records, right? His legacy is more important to him than his pecks and his haircut and his mirror. And that's saying something about Ronaldo. Look, see him and Messi, they are FIFA's big golden egg layers, aren't they? So FIFA won't let them go. Messi's team are now in the World Club Championship. Why? They didn't win the league. FIFA, as we know, will do anything at all anywhere, with anyone, to make a turn of buck. And they do it all the time. And by the way, you had to redact all your stuff. I haven't. No, I noticed that. I was spending slightly nerdy. But they make up their own rules as they go along, right? Let's not have a vote, right? Who's going to get the World Cup? Let's do it on a clapometer. I mean, what's going on? You'd love to see the clapometer. That's what they used this week. I cannot believe it. I tell you something about the 2034 World Cup in Saudi Arabia. They'll try and get Cristiano and Lionel to play. The era is over and sadly the end is getting messy. Very good, Pat. All right, on to question. It got an approving from Kat as well. Question two comes from you the listeners, so we've posted on our social media channels. Fighting Talk 316 on X. FT316 on Facebook. still not on blue sky. This week's question two comes from Mog. And a lot of excitement here because producer Simon gets to plunder his large collection of 70s power pop records again. Because Mogg, you're the former bass player with the Smirks. Is that right? It's right, yes. Well, Simon was so excited about this he's texted me during the week, he doesn't mean you're just to say that got Sullivan in the top coming. And I obviously have no idea it's different about, but I cannot say you how come to you. How are you? Are you? I'm all right, yeah, yeah. It does mean that your in-state music is just you. Whoa! California matters, you're gonna'all. We're enjoying it, Mock. A great baseline, hasn't it? You've given you a great time, Mark? Okay, what do you want to ask? Please, to see if you're helping, myself and my partner, always the hands of the City games last season. Because of this, we had our season tickets revoked unfairly in our opinion. Since then, cities form has plummeted. What are other examples of instant karma in sport? It's a really good question. There's a little bit of needle in there as well, which I like. I'm going away back to 2010. Ghana versus Uruguay. Remember Louis Suarez, which I like. I'm going away back to 2010. Ghana versus Uruguay. Remember Louis Suarez and he saved in the top corner, he got his hand up to it. It was a good save, I'll give him that, but he was cheating, right? He has all the morality of a hungry great white shark where a similar tendency to nibble at anything in his general vicinity. Ghana was distraught but he didn't care as stuff. Twelve long years later, Uruguay play Gana and Qatar. I'm there. Surely we'll get it right this time. But no, Uruguay won 2-0. Gannett are going out. There's to be no redemption. This is so wrong. But wait, 91st minute. South Korea score against Portugal in the other game. Everyone suddenly realizes Uruguay out. The Ghanaians go absolutely mad. Those teeth disappear. There's ecstasy all around. The only time in my life, I was totally biased on Radio 5 live wanting one team to win, one team to lose. Suarez finally had bitten off more than he can chew. Instant karma. I was at that game. And when the news broke, it was just really in the atmosphere. Oh, it was sensational. David. It's slightly sticky given what happened in Europe this week. But I'm just thinking about someone who did a fantastic job as a manager, temporary manager of Manchester United, Rudd Van Nistroy. Yes. He then left and the team that he had taken from the depths of Man United fans in the house, starting to smile, taking the depths and risen them to unseen highs of this season. Plummitted straight after. And he was laughing as he took the Leicester job and now is resurrecting Leicester City. So instant karma by leaving Manchester Night and doing so well. Kat? I didn't hear a bell. No, no, you might get some points from Mog. I mean, I don't think you will, but you might. Well, I mean, they're good stories, but instant karma. I mean, there was a good number of years between Uruguay. That's actually, that's fair Christism, actually. It's incredibly slow karma. I think the best examples of instant karma are when showboating goes wrong, isn't it? Lindsay Jacobelis, the American snowboarder in Turin at the Olympics, coming down, the snowboard cross, 40 metres clear, comes over the last kicker and decides she's going to pull a trick. And she reaches down, grabs onto a snowboard, wipes out on the landing. The girl behind her comes through and wins the gold medal. I mean, that is instant karma. But in another carmatic twist, 16 years later, Jacob Ellis comes back to the Winter Olympics in 2022, and she wins the gold medal at the age of 37. So the instant karma comes back round. And then some of Pat's very slow karma. In some very slow karma, and she gets the gold medal a good 16 years later. That's how you get some points out of me, David. Watch and learn. Danny. One of the best things about sport is watching people get punched in the face, and I like watching people get punched in the face. One of the best things about people getting punched in the face is when they ask people to punch them in the face, thinking they're not going to punch them in the face. Anderson Silver versus Chris Wydenman in 2013, Anderson Silver is regarded as the greatest MMA fighter of all time. No one gave Chris Wyatman a chance. Anderson Silver is one of the best strikers in the game, just stood there, begged Chris Wyatman to hit him, hit him, he did, sparked him out, knocked him out, one of the biggest upsets ever in combat sports. Three very good answers there, Mogg. Who are you going to give the points to, do you think? Well, my partner said I had to give him Pat, with a being from Scotland herself. It was rigged. No, no, but there was that technicality, wasn't there, of his karma not being instant. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And MMA, I don't know what the heck that is. So mainly, it's not rigged, but mainly for giving me five of the most exciting moments of my life. Forget Aguero, forget Ballotelli, when David James played up front of city. That was your punk rock magic. So I'll give you for David. I mean, that is an absolute travesty. Thank you very much. I'm going to play a little bit more, actually, of the Smarks, because I enjoyed it. Here we go again. This is really for produced, Simon. That's got to be 116 charges now. What? Thanks very much, Mogg. Have a good day, cheers. Cheers. Cheers, you too. Thanks. Bye back. Thank you. Cannot believe that, David. You've got the points. Nothing to do. He didn't even mention your answer. Gave the points because he likes you. Right, Pep says in the times this week, I'd like to cook, learn French and play more golf, which is very pep, isn't it? I'd like you to complete this sentence for another sports person. I'd like to X, learn more Y, and play more Z. Pat. Gianni Infantino. I would like to be on every TV screen around the world at least once every single day to allow more people to know how wonderful, how trusted and how important I am Quite a long X. I'd like to learn more about how to tell people why should be the planet's arbiter of good taste and morality. Everyone's moral decisions about what should be campaigned about should be directed by me. Obviously, to play more tournaments, because there aren't enough tournaments in more places. But honestly, not just to make money. So apparently Elon Musk is sitting up a five-aside on Mars. I'll just call Cristiano and Lionel and Bexin. Get them up to do it up there. The mugs will buy it and buy it. He'll be carbon neutral too. Yeah. So you're an infantino fan, is what you're telling me. Danny. I've gone with Marcus Rashford, and I've gone with a, I'd like to get on an easy jet to Paris, and also learn more French, and play against players who are nowhere near as good as the players in the Premier League. Pithier. To be fair, cook, learn French and play more golf, sounds, you know, they're my three. This is a retirement, isn't it? New Year's resolutions. Sounds pretty good to me. I've gone with Bill Belichick, the legendary former coach of the New England Patriots, six-time Super Bowl winner with the Patriots. He's going back to college. He's taken on a job as the North Carolina head coach, so I've said, at the risk of falling into stereotypical student tropes, I'd like to sleep late, learn TikTok dancers and play more drinking games. All of which you'd like to see from him. David. Wow, James Milner. This is never going to happen, by the way. Okay. James Milner, I'd like to put on weight. I'd like to relax, and I'd like to play more cribbage. Play more cribbage. Now, cribbage, I have to say, is an absolutely superb game. And I suspect that he probably does play it. The shortlist is out for sports personality of the year, 24. Some terrific achievements on the field, the track and the hockey to admire among the nominees. But who would actually win if personality was the only criteria, Cat. I went from Brianne Page. She was a gold medialist in the trampolining in Paris. She's the first British individual Olympic champion in gymnastics. She's a great girl. She carried the flag as well in the closing ceremony, which is always, you know, nominated by the team for being such a kind of cheerleader amongst the team great personality and after winning Olympic gold she's gone off to join the circus and she's 35 as well winning Olympic gold in trampolini it's pretty amazing Danny I was gonna go with Carl Palmer but I don't think you can have personality by having no personality I think that's his personality he's just sort of he's almost crossed over into I look forward to those interviews more than any other. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I feel like he might be forcing it a bit now. So what I've gone with, I've gone with Jack Greelish for the fact that like no one remembers who he is. He's been rubbish for over a year. He's technically a worse signing than Anthony and everyone still loves him. No one said a bad word about him. Yeah, because he's got crap. He's caught no flat because he's just pure personality. That's all he is. Pat, do you have I watch match of the day and all those things? They keep on getting the same person for Gary Lineker to go and interview. And there's a reason for it. There was one person who I think has got the best personality. I want to go down the pub and have a drink with him. He's funny, he's witty, self-deprecating. But I had to check. And I asked one of our five live guys who's the best person to interview and I was hoping it by this guy and he immediately said Thomas Frank and I said you're right what a man he's you want to hang about well yes it's just so cool so likeable and by the way he's talented to yeah there's a really nice clip doing the rounds of him talking to the team after after a win and it's so he's exactly what you want in a manager he's just a cool guy david well i'm going to keep it in-house as well a radio five live co-commentator current premier league footballer england international legend is connor cody is harsh but yes conicody he's a type of guy that would win the award and come out with something absolutely funny as he received the award. A good speech, would it? It would be funny. We'd be in stitches. He's a good guy as well. Some very good guys in there. Let's check in with the scores. And quite low scoring, which is probably on me rather than on you. David and Kat trailing on nine, but it's all very tight. Danny has 10 and Pat has 11. Talk amongst yourselves. The first round has knackered me. Well, you knackered yourself. The final topic of the first half is all about this. As Ciccarea slips over, now Johnson dispossesses him, Salai, and the near prize. Cuccarea slipped over again. Now he has Coulousepsky. Right side of the penalty area, trying to work a position. Left foot shot. Oh, he's gone and scored. Funny, very funny. Mark Cicurea binned his football boots after the Chelsea fullback, slipped twice. Kossey's side a couple of goals against spurs. What has been your biggest sports kit disaster or just general wardrobe malfunction? Pat. Imagine yourself, you're going to be playing for your country. It's so exciting. So I'm sitting on the bench and I'm simply saying my best mate, Brian McClare. And it's 20 minutes and a second half. And I'm waiting to be called on. And the manager turns around looks at me and then ignores me and tells Brian McClare he get changed and go on. So Brian McClare takes off his tracksuit bottoms to discover he has no shorts on. And I was so delighted. Did you give him your shorts? It's your best mate. Sadly, he ran back into his dressing. Danny. So my first ever football trial, I was 11. I remember going and I was so excited. I was playing. I got some new football boots and I took them with me. Predators? No, I was always night. I got some T.M. Pose. And I turned up with my T.m.os to find out that it was actually, it was in a sports all. So I was tempted to do that thing that a few lads used to do where they just unscrewed the studs and just slipped around. Yeah. Yeah. Better David. Better. What I decided to do was playing the shoes I had on, which were at the time size nine construction boots. I had big feet for a kid, like, oh my feet have just stayed the same since year seven. So they were like... How tall were you? Not tall. That is a mad look. Yeah, I looked like a Pez dispenser. So just running around in these fake timbrel and boots, like these caterpillar steel toe cap things, just stomping around like ludicrous in the stand-up video. And yeah, didn't score a goal. Couldn't move. I was essentially a table football player. Is that guy playing stuck in the mud? Yeah, it's like horrible. Like your calves at the end of the session were just like swall, just pure lactic acid. You know those like yellow and black laces? You know those classic. Yeah, I had cement dust on them. I mean, it's awful. Really good. pure lactic acid. You know those like yellow and black laces? You know those classic. Yeah, I had cement dust on them. I mean, it's awful. Really good. And nice to imagine the coaches at the end to say. So who did we like? Obviously not construction. Yeah. Not wreck it, Ralph. Kat. I've been on an early flight in from Sweden where I'd been covering some European equestrian action. And I flew into Belfast. That was a show off, Kat. I flew into Belfast. That was a show off, Kat. I flew into Belfast to cover the women's rugby world cup in 2017. And we pulled up outside Ulster's ground. And I'd got myself this massive coffee and the cameraman was driving the car. And he'd forgotten that it was a gear stick car. So it takes his feet off the clutch and the whole car leaps. The coffee goes all over my face, it's dripping off my face, all the way down the front of my white coat. But to add insult to injury, the cameraman who was profusely apologetic, but he picked up as a joke to lighten the situation, this enormous bottle of sparkling water that he had in the glove compartment next to him, and he pretended, I'll just wash it off and he threw, but the lid came off. Love it. And so the coffee and the sparkling and he threw, but the lid came off. Love it. And so the coffee and the sparkling water mingled all the way down me and was pooling on the leather seat, wet to my pants, had to go and fully change before we could do any work on the women's World Cup. Pooling on the leather seat has given me the ick. David. Well, imagine representing your country. I can't remember what year it was. England used to do 11 subs at halftime. There was a massive outcry by the supporters that it shouldn't happen, blah, blah, blah. In friendlies? In friendlies, of course. I was designated substitute goalkeeper for England as we played Denmark away in some city in Denmark. The day before the game, I'd only taken one pair of boots with me because the sub doesn't usually get on. In the warm-up training session, my boot split. My boots were knackered. I contact my boot supplier and said, can you bring some boots for tomorrow's game because I'm on the bench? They sort that out. The following day, Ray Clements, the legend that is, says, Jamo, you're going on second half. Thank you. Not prepared. Didn't have any boots at that point. When the boots came through, rather than the size 10 and a half, which I normally wore, they were a size 11. I proceeded to go on the second half. A couple of pairs of socks, you all right with that? A growing room, yeah. Handy for a goalkeeper as well, taking a bit more space in the net. Do you know what? If I'd have thought all as well, taking a bit more space in the net. True, actually. If I had thought all these positives, I might not. I might not have let four goals in and injured Romadale because I couldn't get to him quick enough. I was shocking. It was the worst performance I'd ever done for England. Did you honestly ship four? They were great goals. Well, you need it with some rubber sole caterpillars. I would have looked in place and Sven, the great Sven, treated me by dropping me. Well, it sounds like you deserve to be drops. All right, that is it for the first half. 26 minutes of all of our lives. Just gone. Never to be recovered. Anyway, we'll be back after the news and the actual sport. Hello, welcome back to Fighting Talk. Welcome back to our panel. Pat Nevin, 28 caps. David James, 53 caps, cat downs, all caps, and Danny McLaughlin, one beanie. We are on the BBC Sounds app as well, which means if you just joined it on the radio, you can go now and listen back from the start, and you won't miss hearing David James trying to claim that 40 or 4 is not a round number because it's pointy. Amazingly, and this has never happened before to me on this show, he continued to talk about this while the news was on, and I took a point off in the break. I've never taken a point off of anyone during the break before, but it's that bad, David. We can't take two points off. No, that's just me making the point of the point was was that, it's that bad, David. We can't take two points off. No, that's just me making the point of the point was gone. So it's on the record. Nothing to do with the fact that five is round. Okay, stop it. Stop it. Onwards. Right. So, you will probably have seen this. This is game changer time. So five points to be won, five points to be lost. Juan Soto became one of, maybe the richest athlete This is game changer time, so five points to be won, five points to be lost. Juan Soto became one of maybe the richest athlete in the world. So the baseball star signed for the New York Mets for $765 million. 765 million. To put that in perspective, that is more than basketball superstar LeBron James earned in the NBA in his entire career. You could buy an MLS franchise, you could buy a Formula One team for less than that. I would like you to blow me down with a feather and tell me some other really expensive things in sport that you could buy, and it still be less than Juan Soto's earnings. I'll start with David, please. Just get out of the way. Oh, thank you. So, 600 million pounds is the conversion. You could fund the winter and summer Olympics and Paralympics for 365 million. You could also pay wages. Pay the wages of League 1 at 200 million and leave yourself quick math, 35 million change to do what you want with. Okay, so I'm paying, I'm not really getting anything out of that. But okay, fine. Other than his wages, his contract could fund the whole of our Olympics. Oh yeah, but I wouldn't own the Olympics. Um, Kat. Um, you could send the entire Chelsea squad into space twice. Here we go. Here we go. SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket, 62 million pounds per launch. Each rocket holds seven people. So for 765 million, you could send 84 people into space. That's two times the Chelsea squad. That's absolutely lovely. And do you own that? Danny. No, no. But I've got the memories. If I had the 765 million. I think you've got the memories. If I had the memories. If you've got the memories of the whole Olympics team, the Paralympic team. Yes, but the Olympics is going to happen whether I fund it or not, David. I'm still going to watch the Olympics. Ditto League One. Still happening. I'm just, I'm just giving them my money. It just wasn't in the question. The Chelsea players are not, as far as we know, going to space without my intervention. Pat. Right. $765 million. This is the least woke answer know, going to space without my intervention. Pat. Right, $765 million. This is the least woke answer you're going to get. That could buy me roughly 19,125 electric cars. I live in rural Scotland and I have to drive to the games. We don't fly internally on the BBC. No, we don't. There are 245,000 miles of roads in the UK. That means I could part one of them fully charged every 12.9 miles and if I did that and kept them all fully charged that would be as easy as driving my own car right so I said to someone recently was I don't have an electric car because you know if I drive all the way to Anfield you know 60,000 people there and they say yeah you could charge it during the game yeah right where are you going to have a charger that's working with 60,000 people all parked outside I think possibly not so we get the infrastructure right and it will be okay so yeah and the infrastructure in this case is 19,000 of your own personal electric vehicles yes and Danny it depends what day it is if's not a Tuesday, you can buy three medium pizzas from Dominoes. Yeah. But if it is, I'm taking half a billion and I'm going to put on the 1994 World Cup in America. That's how much that costs. Normally World Cups cost billions of billions. This one cost half a billion because they already had the stadium in place. It's my favourite one ever. Diana Ross missing a penalty, obviously, Jordan Letchkov diving edder. The best kits, the worst celebration, Ray Houghton's forward role. Balserama's hair. Yeah, I just think it's the best one. It's the one that I'd like to revisit and for half a billion I could do that. Is that Aldridge going absolutely mad at the side? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Good World Cup. Weirdly, you realise that World Cups are quite fun when England aren't. That's what I would say, yeah, it's the last one we qualify for. And it just, yeah, you can pick a team that you can just, like Norway. Yeah, I was Republic myself. Okay, so I've got David buying the Olympics and paying the wages in league one. And change. I've got, and change. I've got Chelsea going into the entire Chelsea squad going into space twice, which honestly, I think as a TV show has got legs. I've got Pat buying himself 19,000 electric vehicles and just parking them at 13 mile junctures all around the UK. And I've got Danny. Do you think you're restaging the 1994 World Cup? Or you're just sort of, you're going back in time. Yeah, with the same players. I've got, I've got to have to, you know, I'm going to have to give it to Kat. Because Chelsea in space is, it's very pleasing as a concept. So five points to you, Cat. But who would you like to take the five points from? Would you like to know the current score position? Yeah, I think I should. An informal position would be good. So it would be really cruel and unusual to take them off David, who is languishing on 13 points. Not to say you can't. Pat has 18, Danny has 19. You're currently on 15. You can take them from a spread. You don't have to take them all from one person. I'll take three from Pat then and two from Danny. That is excellent gameplay. It really is. Three from Pat, two from Danny. Although weirdly, so you think that Pat is more of a threat than Danny even though Danny's ahead? Yes. Good to know. Good to know. Good to know. All right. Next topic is all about this. Thanks for leaving me. Paul Gibbs White is going to cross again. Far post. Chris Wood hanging and goal. Chris Wood's done it again. And Forest leave by three goals to one at Old Trafford. Good old Chris Woods. Nuno Espirito Santo, very happy after watching Notting and Forrest beat Majesty United three to Old Trafford. Good old Chris Woods. Nuno Espirito Santo, very happy after watching Notting Forest beat Majesty United Three to Old Trafford last weekend, saying afterwards not many things to be upset about. So in a rare sort of positive fighting talk moment, who else in sport is heading towards Christmas full of festive cheer? Pat. Right. David Moyes, of all people. We get our presents now. We can sit back, enjoy him, but he can really enjoy Christmas dinner, watching the TV, putting on a little bit of timber. Wouldn't say that to his face. Knowing that the biggest, most valuable present, it's just about to arrive in the new year, because someone's going to give him a job, someone down the bottom of the league, and they're going to say, how much money do you want, David? And he's going to think of a really big number, and then he's going to treble it. And they'll still give him a job to keep him up. So David Moyes can really enjoy Christmas because he's going to get a new job in the new year. So if you're a betting man, where do you think he ends up, Pat? Oh, that's it. West Ham. Again. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Sort of West End fans the other night. And they were very split on that. But mainly they were saying they didn't think he'd come. I suppose it depends how much money there is. Exactly. Cat. Isn't that always the way? Depends how much money there is. I've gone for Harry Brooke. The England batsman's moved above England teammate Joe Root. That's necessary. He's moved above Joe Root to become the number one test batter in the world rankings. The third test starts in Hamilton on the 14th of December. So just a couple of days away. Not Lewis Hamilton, Hamilton, New Zealand. And Joe Root is just one point behind Harry Brook in the world batting rankings as well. So the position could switch. But for now, Harry Brooke is going into the festive period on top. He is. David. Well, it's easy to look at the most popular sports in the world, but I've gone for a sport which I think Hertfordshire has to be the kings of and that is men's basketball. And in the men's basketball, we have one of the greatest men's basketball teams in Halfordshire ever. I forgot what their names are. Hemel Storm. Hemel Storm. Hemel Storm. Top of the table. Nine out of nine, which is a round number. And they... Don't shake your head at me like that again. I can't help it. Okay, yeah, Hemelstorm. Top of the league. Nine out of nine. Hemelstorm. No one had that on their bingo card. Danny. I'm going for someone I don't think has had a better December since Rudolph the Red Nose Reindeer. I'm going with Arsenal's set piece coach, Nicholas Yover. Like, where did this come from? Like, they're chatting like he's invented corners. Some people are chatting like he's invented height. Like... The amount of coverage this guy is going, I've never seen cameras on a set piece coach like that before. No, it's, it's egregious that he's got a mural now on a wall in North London. Like, it's like going in Primark and there being a mural of Sheila from the stock room. Like, who is this guy? Like, why? Like, basically he said, kick it there and the big people will ether it. Like, it's mad. I can't get my head round it, but he's got to have the best, he's got to have the best Christmas ever, this guy. Do you know what I love is the way that he goes to the edge of the technical area when they're doing the set place? I think he's building his part. He is. He knows what he's doing. He doesn't need to go out there. They know what they're doing. They're all just crowded around the back post and then they're running towards the front post. He might be the next bond. He'll have an album out by March. Like, you can see the play. You can see what's happening. Aaron Taylor Johnson, absolutely fuming. I can't believe I missed out. I thought it was in the bag for me. All right, it was reported this week that Marcus Rashford could be up for sale due to concerns about his lifestyle. Now, if what the Uber driver told our producer about the time he drove Rashford home, that is quite a lifestyle. And obviously, you can always believe anything that Cabby tells you. And I was specifically told not to pass any comment on what the cabby did say. Rashford is also one of Man United's highest earners. So which sportsperson's lifestyle would you most like to have right now? And it obviously can be Arsenal's set piece coach if you like. I'm switching my answer. Yeah. I'm going to go for 100 metre sprinter. I think you know they always get the big crowds at the Olympics. It's the blue ribboned event. They become these enormous names with these massive sponsorship deals. They only do 10 seconds of work, which sounds pretty good to me. As a woman, you get to have the hair, the lashes, the nails, the makeup. And nailing it down to one specific 100 metre sprinter, I'm going to go for 16-year-old gout-gout. Have you heard of him? Yeah, yeah, yeah. He's this Australian Wonder Kid who has broken the record. He's the fastest ever 16-year-old, and he's the fastest ever under 18-year-old, in fact, won the schoolboy championships in Australia with this incredible time of 20.04 for the 200 meters. And now he's off to the States to go and train with Noah Lyle's. You know, he's on the cusp of becoming this global superstar. He's got all this talent. In a few years time, there's going to be an Olympics in Australia. He's going to be 24. He's going to be like the poster boy of his home Olympics. He's got it all laid out in front of him. Did you hear what his dad said about his name this week? It's quite good because obviously he's everywhere. Everyone's like, this gout kid and the guy's like, we've made a clerical error. His name is Gwok-Gwot, but it got written down as Gout Gout. Now they can't undo it. He's just like, we're just going to have to, well, it's gout-gout. Yeah, that's going to be it. I know a lad called Alan, who's called Alan because his dad forgot what they were going to call him. Like they'd arrange the name, so he just said his own name. So he's Alan Jr. because his dad forgot what they were going to call him. Like, they'd arrange the name. So he just said his own name. So he's Alan Jr. Because his dad couldn't remember what they'd name their degree. Because he was drunk at the birth. Alan. Yeah, what they're calling him. And he just said his own name. So now this kid, like, is walking around, like, year seven called Alan. You don't get many Alan. No. That's not a bad thing. Yeah, that's very nice. For Alan and for gout gout. David. One of the most popular sports in the world is angling. So many people do it. You just relax, you chill. And I would like to consider, I can't even pronounce his name, Laslo. Does he just call him Laslo? Yeah, let's call him Laslo. Laslo is the world champion of angling. And the idea of spending my life as a sportsman. There by the water with me rod, chucking it in, plucking out the odd fish, chucking it back again because I'm all about the environment. Thank you. And just really enjoying the weather. Just chilling. Just chilling. Snacks. Snacks. Loes of snacks. Yes. Quite a bait. Boring. Just chilling. Snacks. Snacks. Loads of snacks. Yes. Quite boring. You could do it with Dean Mason. No, Dean Mason or the Catholic. Yeah, but I could listen to so many podcasts. You've already listened to so many podcasts. Pat. Right, to go back to the former point you're talking about names, take a point off now for the name drop that I'm going to give you here. A guy once said to me, my name's Edison, but it was a mistake by my father. He meant to call me Itson. He put an eye in. So that was Pelly that told me that. Right. Thank you, Klan. That's great. Right. So, who do you want to be? Do you want to hang about and actually run like a sprint? No, you could do, but it sounds like hard work. Do you want to do fishing? Yeah, I agree, a bit boring. Top level surfer. Come on. They're all tall, blonde, buff and gorgeous. Males and the females, they hang out at the coolest places in the world. What do they do? They mess about in the water, then they party on the beach and the sunshine. And then they party all night and warm, balmy evenings. And apparently the parties are pretty good doing. And they get paid for it. I mean, come on. That is a very, very, I'm certainly taking that over sitting by a miserable late with a rod out, David. Yeah, you wait till the shark turns up. Who's safer? The one in the boat or the one on the paddle? Danny. Well, that's it. A lot of all that stuff's great, but it's a lot of hard work. Like you said, there's sharks and waves in the boat or the one on the paddle uh danny well that's it a lot of all that stuff's great but it's a lot hard work like you said there's sharks and waves in the surfing like you stink of like bait when you're fishing and it can rain and run it that just sounds like a lot rub bait all over yourself when you think you have to put your hands in though you have to put your hands in to the sweet corn but um so i'm going with someone who's done absolutely nothing for years and has been paid handsomely not just that but won the lot i'm going with scott carson oh. Third, third keeper at Man City gets to watch one of the best football teams there's ever been from the bench. Probably does a bit of warm up, bit of kicking, like, oh, catch that. And he's on 30 grand a week or whatever just to sit there. He goes to all the parties, but can drink at all the parties. He hasn't got to get up for work pretty much. So I think it's genuinely, other than being like the bass player in Coldplay, it might be like the best life. But the base player has to do the job. I suppose he has to, yeah. So you do realize that Scottie Carson's on the pitch every game. Yeah, doing what? Just doing part of the warm up, just in case. Oh, the warm. Yeah. He does the warm up. He is the guy that stops the shots from the other guys in the warm up. The worst thing that can happen to Carson is that he has to play and his boots are a size too big. That's like literally the worst-case scenario. You never want to experience that. Didn't Tom Heaton do something like that with England over the euros? Wasn't Tom Heaton sort of in the squad in some weird capacity? I felt like that in a few years. Yeah. Why am I here? It's definitely in a weird capacity. Right. Saudi World Cup. It was inevitable. It does raise a few serious issues, none of which I'm going to go near because I've been told not to in no uncertain terms. But if money was no object or you were New York Mets outfielder Juan Soto, what sport would you put where? Danny. I'm going with the Winter Olympics in the Arctic Circle before climate change has its way and there's no winter to Olympic. It's sort of the best place to put it. It's like the end of level boss locations. Yeah, definitely. Yeah, it's a nice idea. Kat. We live on a farm in the Peak District and we recently discovered that our fields used to be a golf course. And so I would like to reinstate the golf course, possibly using, you know, one of the big golf course architect. Now, Robert Trent Jones or someone who can come and create some massive championship golf course in my fields, and I would host the Ryder Cup on my farm. I mean, I'm trying to work out whether that is a bigger brag than Pat's Pele stuff. It's like, basically, we've got so much land. I think we could do the Ryder Cup here. There's a driving rage around there as well called Peak Practice. I don't know if you've seen it but it's really funny. David, yeah I was putting around in the back garden and I found myself a golf course. The Darts on Mount Everest. I'm thinking to explain that a little. Okay, so Mount Everest Base Camp. I'm just thinking the Darts World Championship is one of the most entertaining so Mount Everest Base Camp. I'm just thinking the Darts World Championship is one of the most entertaining events. The crowd are... I don't think any of them are making it up there. I've got all the money in the world. I'm paying for them to. It's like the Chelsea team going to space. I've got the money to pay for this. Don't roll your eyes at Mojew. Have you left them up there or you bring them back down here? Leaving them up there. Yeah, so we're having a Darts World Championship, base camp, Mount Everest, and then we shall see the true talent of these athletes when they throw the darts with a hundred mile an hour winds and see how accurate they are then. Yes, okay. Pat. I'm just going to stay in Saudi Arabia. I'm not moving anywhere. It's lovely and it's warm and there's lots of sand. And we're told they're going to be much more open and accepting'm not moving anywhere. It's lovely and it's warm and there's lots of sand. And we're told they're going to be much more open and accepting. So can we have the women's beach volleyball world championships over in Saudi Arabia? Please. I'll have that. I'll not go too far. Let's make sure there's not a French sports TV director in charge of the filming. Apart from that, go for it. We're just going to leave it there. All right. Finally, a one-liner. Maybe you're just a one-worder or a one-nameer, in fact. Luke Littler was the most Googled athlete in the UK in 2024. Beating out Sarkir-Stama, beating out King Charles in the search stakes. But what did you put in your search bar most in 2024 sport related, Pat. Sadly, I did Arsenal and Corners and all that come up was, after that I kept on getting things like Tony Pillis and Stoke and crazy gambling and Wimbledon came out after it and get it in the mixer. I don't know, that's what happened to me. And I don't think that's very fair in Arsenal because I'm going down there in a couple of weeks. Well, it is a classic get it in the mixer though, isn't it? Ultimately that they're doing. And David? Sport-related, because I collect old toys. Action man, sportsman in a football kit in a box. And did you get one? Got a few. Who's your favourite? They're all the same. Incredible. Cat. Quick search from this week's European action from a couple of nights ago is Timo Verna, half Scottish, just to check. And then my most Googled search line is, starts always with how to pronounce. As a commentator, how to pronounce it. One of them that I definitely double-checked. I do speak French, but there's a French diver called Naise Gilles, and I just wanted to check that I was getting that right in case people thought I was taking the Mickey. It's incidentally what I've asked my brother to get me for Christmas. Danny. I normally as a United fan, I'm searching Manchester United, but because it's been so grim lately, I just add under-18s to the search bar. They're so good. They're the best under-18s team in Europe at the minute. Ten games, ten wins. They've only conceded four goals, and it's the one thing as a United fan that there's actually some hope for. It just makes me so happy to hear you clinging to that. Okay, any other business? Pat. I've got so many of them. I try not to be bitter in this competition but always am look people speaking at gigs is driving me absolutely not nuts was at London Grammar recently Abba and the There each brilliant by every occasion partially ruined by people talking are bawling at each other constantly and girls yes it involves you for once as well particularly it has to be said at the Abbey event. It's happening everywhere. People do not understand how to go and enjoy it. They just shout and ball over each other. I've had enough. I want to go back to Glasgow in the 1970s and get the old-fashioned bouncers at the Glasgow Apollo. They'd set them out. Yeah, that's quite threatening. David. Just a quick one, really. CERN. And they're, they want to... They don't get a lot of air time on this show, so it's nice for them. Yeah, well, they're trying to work out how they're going to transport antimatter. Yeah, yeah. And what's going to happen if it goes wrong. That is my other business. I mean... So you think they shouldn't be messing around with antimatter? I think they need to have a really good plan before they start moving it around because if they get it wrong, then things are going to disappear like no one's business. I think they probably will have quite a good plan and also not going to be moving very much of it, so I think you're going to be all right. Thanks you very sure. Yeah. Kat. I just wanted to do a bit of festive admin and find out if there's anyone on the panel with whom I'm Quality Street compatible. Oh yeah, very nice. This time of year. So in our household, we like the orange creams, strawberry creams, green triangles. The toffies always get left behind. So I just wanted to know if anyone leaves the strawberry creams, orange creams and triangles, we can then do a swap. I can arrange to meet up with you after Christmas. We can swap our half-eaten boxes of Quality Street for the chocolates we actually want. I am incompatible in a sense. I'm too compatible and I'm basically eating the same ones. Yeah, we're not compatible. David? I'm out. David? I don't eat them. Of course he doesn't. Yeah, I don't like the toffee either. There's going to be a lot of toffies. Yeah. Okay. What are you eating? Toffies obviously have to be left, but the green triangles, you can have all of mine. Great. Oh, okay, okay. I'm coming to pick them up after Christmas. Do toffies ever get soft? I think they'll probably get harder, don't they? They're always hard, aren't they? They're never soft. I think they're hardening up with time. Maybe you need to eat them first. Get them done. Just get them out the way, like your vegetables. Exactly. You could heat them up. You could take them to Sian. David genuinely looks interested by that idea. But we have got time to get into it, Danny. My nan used to unwrap the coffee creams and then wrap them back up in the purple wrappers and give them to the kids. That's funny. Honestly, that's disgusting. I'm going with rubbish santas. If you're having a santa in your like your store or your shop or your local wherever make sure the santa's have put a bit of effort in i'm seeing strings i saw a santa in a pair of air max 90s the other day like i saw one with a ginger beard like how has your santa got ginger beer one didn't even have a santa hat he had like a rolled up fisherman fisherman-beanie Santa hat. I feel like they're just like making calls and going, look, do you, how have you are? And some of them, like, they're not tall enough. They're not big enough. Like, I just think it's, if you're going to do Santa, you've got to stick to that. To that after-time. You've got to book them early, though. That's the problem, isn't it? You've got to get in there and get them booked. Yeah, but I think it's better to have no Santa than to be like, it's Clive. I think I can probably confirm that because when I was 17, I worked in a garden centre, we had a very poor grotto and my thing was I'd have to dress out as an elf, so a big gangly elf, which is no good in the first place. One morning, the Santa calls in sick. I have to be 17-year-old beanpole Santa. It was absolutely, it was awful. Yeah, but no one was enjoying it. There's loads of them now. But Santa was 17 at some point in his life. Yes, but not at the age where you want to see him and sit on his lap. Okay. You know what I mean? Okay. It would have been so much better to just cancel the grotto for that day. Santa's not here, he's out. Way better. Making toys. All right. Final scores then. David, you'll be unsurprised to hear that you've been absolutely annihilated. 22 points. Antimatter. Pat and Katz are tied on 28. Interestingly, Danny out in front on 30. So we need to decide who's going to go through between Pat and Kat. I think, I think, weirdly, I'm going to put Cat through on the basis she could have taken more points off of Pat but didn't. So poor gameplay, but I'm going to make it up to her. Also, as we've already established, Pat, you're too good for this. So Pat and Danny will go, no, so Cat and Danny will go into their head-to-head, defend the indefensible. Ridiculous statement, you've got to answer it, doesn't matter how much it hurts. If I say I, I mean you. Danny, you scored the most points. You go first. You have 20 seconds on the following. Sir Jim Ratcliffe hasn't put a foot wrong since he came in to Ram Manchester United. Oh, no, he hasn't. He's a great guy, because he's mopping up after the glazers. That's the thing. We're canceling Christmas parties that we wouldn't have had to cancel if the glazers had the runners into the ground for 20 years anyway. He's fixed the roof. He's done that. So, yeah, he looks like he's brought the right people in and got rid of them straight away when he needed to. He's no messing about from Ratcliffe. He knows exactly what he wants. He's 73. He's not got long left and he knows. Okay, cats. You have 20 seconds on the following. In solidarity with Mark Kugurea, all footballers should play in carpet slippers this weekend. Well, we've heard, haven't we, over the course of this competition, that it's not just about football boots. It doesn't need to be football boots that fit, as David James has proved. It doesn't even need to be football boots at all. A good pair of builder's boots with steel-enforced toe caps. You know, we could see more goals, we could see harder goals, we could see more excitement on the football pitch. So I absolutely agree. You can just wear carpet slippers. You can wear whatever you like. It's all just a wrap-up by the sponsors. Oh, got a little bit longer, Kat. And it's a shame because I was liking it. I'm still going to give it to Kat. Kat. Congratulations it's a shame because I was liking it. I'm still going to give it to Kat. Kat, congratulations. You're the winner. Thank you very much. It's my first win. First ever win. I'm going into the festive season on a high. Can I go back to question number? Change your answer. No, you may not. Okay, the rest of you, obviously you can do better and you must do better. Thanks for listening. This has been a World's End production for BBC Radio 5 Live. In the podcast Extra, we're going to be ranking the best band you've ever seen live. So something for all you sports fans to enjoy. After the news, it'll be 5 Live Sport. I mean, it usually is. Hello and welcome to the podcast Extra of Fighting Talk. Before we get into Rick's rankings, I would like to delve a little deeper into your Action Man collection, David. Okay. So you've got some sporting action men? Yeah, so Action Man released a, obviously, loads of soldier military style stuff. They did an Olympic Action Man outfit, although that wasn't in the box, but they did a sportsman, and it was the England 66 kit, release in the 70s. Red top white shorts, I think it had red socks. And sideburns. That's nice. No, no, it's crucial. So hang on, who is it modelled on? Is it modelled on any player particularly or not really? No, no, action man is action man. Always the same face. Same face. Except for Tom Stone and Bullet Man who are slightly different. But... So except for who? Bullet Man. Who's Bullet Man? Well, Bullet Man is part of the Action Man range. But he's got like a really funny shaped head and he has a helmet which looks like a bullet. Looks like a bullet. Yeah. And where's red. Spandex. But the sportsman... Do you live on your own, David? I spend a lot of time on my own. Yeah. Going through my X-Man boxes and going... How many have you got? A few. Oh, go on. How many have you got? Well, Axi-Men? Yeah. In the box? Or just generally? Generally? Over 100. You're absolute. With respect. Loser. Yeah, but some of them haven't got... Some of them haven't got arms and some haven't got legs. I've got to put them back together again. Why? Have you pulled them apart? What are you doing? No, they fall apart. So the original action man had like a metal pin to keep the limbs together. Then the next version had like a rubber joint and the rubber joint perishes and their arms and legs fall off. Okay. And are these worth quite a lot of money? Some of them. It's not about money. We're not talking about sending Chelsea players to space here. What is it about? It's about reliving my childhood. Okay. It's about positioning them in such a way that if they're behind me when I'm doing a video podcast, that Manchester United look worse than Man City or Liverpool or the kit that I decide to put on it. Hang on, are you tailor-making kits for them? Well, I look for an appropriately coloured kit, yeah. This is so weird. It's not weird at all. The best one is West Ham's kit. I've got a West Ham kit in the box. I've got an action mind question for you. I mean, I think I know I'm talking about here. I didn't think they had helmets and you said they have. No, the bullet man had a helmet. Come on, Pat, it's bullet man. Yeah. Oh, get the subtle meaning I was making it. I mean, they did some other ones like the Zagon and things like that, but the bullet man had the helmet, but his head is a different head. But don't get mistaken with G.I. Joe. I would never. I wouldn't disrespect you. But they also G.I.J. They're all helmetless, aren't they? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, you can have like the army helmet. Okay. But they changed their blue pants at some point. Okay. I love the idea that when David played for England, they didn't give him a cap. They was like, just get him in action, man. That's why he's got over. He's got loads of them just there holding him. I'll tell you what, I would have had 10 and a half boots. I've had five pairs, by the way. 53 action men. All right, we're going to do, it's a slightly unusual Rick's rankings because it has absolutely no relation whatsoever to sport. So, really out of nowhere, Led Zeppelin have announced a comeback, and it was also announced, unsurprising it, Taylor Swift's 2024 shows, with the biggest earners in the history of live music. So I want to know what are the best bands we've ever seen live. Could be Led Zeppelin or Taylor Swift. Doesn't have to be. I'm going to start. I think I'll start with you, David. Okay. I've seen a few bands. I'm not strangely into pop music until it's unpopular. Then it's the best music in the world. I can't get on that wave like Taylor Swift and all that. So I'll probably like in about 10 years time. I've seen them at the O2 I've seen them at a concert in I'm trying to think of Milton Keynes Dome Muse but they weren't the concert and they were both fantastic concerts one in the dome was superb the drone tour in the O2 was superb. But Mews brothers are from Tingmouth in Devon. And I didn't know they were famous at the time when I was living in Devon. Some said, do you know Muse? And I'm like, no, who are they? Only one of the biggest bands in the world. Okay, fine. They did a free concert for the people of Tingmouth on Tingmouth Green. Went down there and it was insane. Knights of Sidonia. The fact that it was a free concert was the main thing because all the people from Tignmouth were able to come down, enjoy their local band, successful band and they gave back to the people and it was superb. Okay, music, I think it's a good shout actually. Like, even people who know about music so they're very good. Pat, this is slap bang in your wheelhouse. I'm imagining quite difficult for you to pick one. Oh, absolutely horrendous. I'll give you a little pot of history, right? And that was a very small one. So early days before punk, thin lizzie, early Genesis, Simon and Garfunkel. I've seen live. And to be fair, if you ever got a chance, you should have done that. But then there was the dawn of punk and Johnny and the self abusers in Glasgow blank faces all around yes just whip them up I've read the down I would hate to Google that okay they changed their name to simple minds and everybody quite liked them okay um early new order radiohead okay computer time pulp and their palm. There's millions of mouths of mouths, but I'm going to just give you one. And it's not going to give me any points to them. The Cocto Twins, Ulloo, 1983, Beautiful Heaven. Cocto Twins. That's a good shout. So we've got Mews and we got Cocto Twins. Kat? Very high brow, wasn't it, from Pat? I've developed... This is Pat's... That's Pat. Have you ever seen photos of Pat from when he was a young man playing football? Never has anyone looked less like a footballer. He just looked like he was in a band. And I think that's a compliment, Pat. I'll take it, yeah. And the fact that I was nicknamed weirdo with the rest of the players. Yeah, you effectively, as I recall. We've all been there. Yeah, I think they were calling you weirdo for different reasons. You were nicknamed weirdo because you were sort of into cool music and culture. And everyone was like, of course, what I'd say for the rest of the planet, when they all said, you called me weirdo, and I'd look at all the players and say to them, no, no, I'm normal. You're all weird. And I think in the end, I've been proved, right? I genuinely, I think you have. Kat. I've developed a bit of a kind of cynical dislike for all the young trendies that go to Glastonbury now and have their kind of Glastonbury moments and, you know, dress up in their flowery headdresses and stuff. That's just getting out. I know. I think that must be it. But I did have an amazing Glastonbury moment in 2005 watching Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys play at Glastonbury as it had been a really rain. I went to Glastonbury just twice when I was younger and it rained both times. But on this particular evening, the sun came out. I was sitting on the hill high above the pyramid stage eating an exquisite pie which I've not been able to find since it was a smoked cheese and chicken and it was so good I've never been able to recreate it I remember it very well and Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys were playing and it was just beautiful. It was just one of those amazing moments. And now I sit at home and sneer at all the young trendies having their Glastonbury moments going, look, they're just dreaming of that smoke cheese and chicken pie. That's it. Danny. I like our loads of things we mentioned sound like bands and exquisite pie sounds like a band. Action Man's helmet. I've actually got the guy on my t-shirt today. I did it on purpose. I saw Outcast the guy on my t-shirt today. I did it on purpose. I saw Outcast at Best of All, and it's the best thing I've ever seen live. It was their last tour, they haven't toured since. And also, they were on after the Wutang clan who just sent the B team. So there was no Ray Kwan, there was no ghost face, no method. It was like watching Reservoir Dogs, but just Mr. Brown and Mr. Blue. It was dreadful. I had exactly that experience going to watch wutang well in inverted conference at at brixton and being unbelievably excited and then turning up and being like yeah yeah i don't know who caraval cup squad isn't it yeah it's this it's like i mean it was the sort of the killer bees or whatever they yeah the wu tang man that is not yeah that is not and also the sort of the killer bees or whatever they were like, the Wu-Tang man. That is not, yeah, that is not the Wu-Tang. And also the sound was terrible. Yeah, they were amazing. Andre 3000's just, he's one of my favorite people. The one point he was rapping while Big Boy pretended to put a string on him, and he was doing that, and Andre 300 was doing press-ups, and it just looked like, oh, it was amazing. It was absolutely astounding. They're good value. Big boy once said that I looked like, oh, it was amazing. It was absolutely astounding. The Good Valley. A big boy once said that I looked like the albino, Paul Bettany, which is very kind of him. How many press-ups do you do? Don't. That's not the point, David. A nice round number. Yeah, oh, four. He did 3,000. That's why he's called Andre 3,000, because he can do 3,000 press-ups. I don't know how you. Unbelievable shape. I don't know that. Three round numbers. Oh,000. That's why he's called Andre 3,000, because he can do 3,000 press-up. I don't know that. Three round numbers. I don't think I've got an answer for this because I don't know to particularly like live music. But I have seen Arctic Monkeys a bunch of times, and they were really good. So I guess I'll say them, but with no real confidence. Okay, let's get the music going so our top five live bands and I won't do it any particular order my one arctic monkeys maybe muse good solid shout this and good work for charity and the people of timmouth outcast who are sensational beach boys and then the classiest answer of all, the cocktoe twins. That is the least sporting section we've ever done this show, and I won't apologise for it. But that is your lot for this week. Thanks very much, everyone. The Football Daily Podcast.
