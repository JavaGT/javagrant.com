I'm Rick Edwards, and this is Fighting Talk. Hello, good morning, welcome. I was feeling typically uninspired this morning as I started jotting down my intro. And then I thought, approximately 18 months late onto this particular train, let's get an AI to write it. So I have, and this is what it's come up with verbatim. Welcome to Fighting Talk, the radio show, also available on BBC Sounds, that is my edition, that takes the world of sports and turns it upside down. If you've ever wondered what happens when sports commentary meets comedy, then you're in for a treat. Strap in because we're about to dive into a delightful blend of banter, debate, and a sprinkle of chaos. So that is absolutely appalling, but by no means the worst script I've ever read out. It continues, let's face it, sports can be serious business, but sometimes you just need to laugh at the absurdities like that time a footballer attempted a and then it just stops. And we never know what the AI thinks would be observed for a footballer to do because I am not going to pay for the premium version. Let's see who is up for some banter debate and a sprinkle of chaos this morning. First in a stellar 23-24 season. So this man make the Fighting Talk Champion of Champions show back for a second fighting talk of the season with a win under his belt already. Comic Manchester United fan, Danny McLaughlin. Hello, Danny. right yeah I'm good thanks um now off air you just told me that your least favorite ever fighting talk question features this week yeah really excited yeah there's a number of contenders I've just scanning through some really poor ones but yeah I'll star the one I think it is when we get to it. Right. Next, it is a first show of the season for last year's standout debutant called Katie. She's a colleague of mine, so just two, no favouritism. BBC sports reporter, breakfast show person that sits over there to my right every half an hour. Katie Smith's here. Hello, Katie. You took points off me last time. And I will always take points off me last time. And I will always take points off you. Just I don't want to get accused of favouritism, Katie. Also, just because it's impressive and I think more people should know where possible, can we go through your weightlifting PBs please? So squat? Squat 100. Lovely. Deadlift. Deadlift. Deadlift. Oh yeah. Clean and jerk? 65. It's lovely stuff. I mean, I'll give you, actually will give you a little point back there. So you're back on an even keel. Also, am I going to be friends with your brother? Yeah, he likes your glasses, doesn't he? Yeah, there we go. Yeah, he said you're a vibe. Yeah, that's, yeah. At another point. Oh, no, hang on, I took one off, sorry. And we're back in business. Also, back for more, formerly of Yoville, Swindon, Bristol, City, Farnborough, Gossport, St. Auburn City, Berry FC. And in case you thought his entire career was spent in the lower leagues, he's also had a spell at Celtic. Stalybridge Celtic. Footballer term presenter, Liam McDevitts here. I thought that list was going to keep going. There was a few. There was a few. I actually had to cut it down. It was like, you play for a lot of clubs. A lot of clubs, yes. Are you still playing? And if not, would you be a good ringer for my five-a-side team? I feel like you would. Get me involved with fivers, not playing anymore. Fivercide is about as good as it gets. Yeah. And were you a striker? Yeah, kick and run. Love that. Love that. We could do what you haven't got a kick-and-run in our team as all. It's tough in five-time. Because we're all too old. Yeah. Yeah, as rightly rightly say just kicking it into the boards finally a fighting talk debut she was telling us how much she loved the show she listens all the time she loves the presenter then it turns out she's talking about 606 so and genuinely how could you love the presenters um 31 england caps point back for that i think now one of the sharpest pundits in the game, Izzy Christensen. How are you? I was hoping this would be 606. It absolutely is not. And I am not Robbie Savage. Right, let's turn the world of sports upside down. Biggest football story of the week. And for once, we mean it. We're going to start with this. I'm honoured to have this role and hopefully we win them over. We've long referred to this job as the impossible job. Okay. Good, I didn't know that before, so I know it now. And so let's make the impossible possible. Yeah, so I'm going to try and debpan this. Wish me luck. He beat off nine other candidates to land the England job. Where would he be in your list of those top ten? Deb Panness, wish me luck. He beat off nine other candidates to land the England job. Where would he be in your list of those top ten? And if not him, who was number one? Liam. I've gone third place. And my top three, none are English, and I'm here for it. I had him at third with Pep and Juergen Klopp in at 1-2. I was conflicted, really. Absolute dreamland. Yeah, I was conflicted with Pep and Klop when I saw they were links. I just didn't want to have to share Klop with Chelsea fans. Anyone. I just want to keep him for ourselves Liverpool. So, yeah, Pep. Or the Red Bull Machine. Yeah, all of that. But Pep, 34 trophies. He's almost so smooth that he's like untabloidable. And I think the impossible job, I reckon if anyone could turn it around, I'd have gone Pep. But two cool third place. I'm happy. I think he's going to be good yeah I think he probably will as well is he wasn't in my top 10 but I didn't have a top 10 so there's some breaking news okay I'm a I'm a I'm a big fan of it I like it a lot big big fan of what he's done Eddie howe probably would have been my preference but I understand well by the sounds of it he wasn't even interviewed however I think he's done. Eddie Howe probably would have been my preference, but I understand, well, by the sounds of it, he wasn't even interviewed. However, I think he's... Eddie However? In terms of selfishness, I love watching Eddie Howe's team play. So if he wasn't playing, I'd say managing every week in the Premier League, we wouldn't be seeing him as frequently. You'd be disappointed. Yeah, so I'm happy with Toekle. I think there's big things to come. Katie? I'd have put Big Tommy Tee like five to nine maybe in the top ten. That's not great, is it, for him? No, but I just think he's not like going to get Bukaiusaka jumping on inflatable unicorns, is he? Like that was kind of what we loved about Southgate, no. I mean, yes, but would you prefer trophies? Are we going to get some? Do you... I mean, I think we might. Okay. Well, he's got his 18-month kind of golden period, hasn't he? Okay, right, but what we want is someone English, right? What we want is a proven winner. What we want is no nonsense. Emma Hayes. Emma! She's won Olympic gold with the USA already. She's got the job done there. First tournament. Barely had any time with them. Imagine her and Serena together. What could they build? I mean, she's on eye-watering money over in the US. So FAA probably didn't want to cough up. But she's the one. Yeah, that would have been very nice. Danny. I wasn't really that bothered, to be honest. I think international football is silly. All these headlines and that for like six games a year. Like, yeah, cool. He was top of my list probably. Are you not loving the international break in the Nations League games? I hate it. Like, honestly, really hate it. And I think the only reason that I'm a bit gutted that it's too shall is I wanted him at United. As a United fan, I think 10 has got to, I don't think 10 Argo'll see fireworks. Like, in November, I think he might be gone. They get slapped by Brentford and slapped by whoever else in the Europa League. Well, yeah. So I was a bit gutted, but I think he is the best available. You mentioned Pep, you mentioned Klop. They were never going to come. Marino's Appi and Turkey, like. Also, and he's done. Like, I just, I think he probably was, like, if you look at who they could actually get on the transfer list of managers that's available. I think he's the one. I think exactly that. I think he is the best available. All right, question number two comes from you, the listeners, who have posted on our social media channels. If you want to pose a question number two, and maybe you do. Jump on to our Twitter, Fighting Talk, 316, or FT316 on Facebook. This week's question two comes from Paul Simmons or Simons. Unfortunately, Paul rang us just before we went on air to say that something's come up. I really like his question. He was a bit gutted. So producer Rachel alongside me is going to read out his question whilst doing her best Paul impression. So are you ready for this, Rach, slash Paul? Yeah. So Paul's Northern Irish, by the way. You are going to need to do the accent. So are you ready for this, Paul? Yeah. Sorry, with the accent? Okay. With Arsumenga being accused of not being a football man by Graham Sooners this week, I want to know who is the best non-football man or woman in football? It's a good question, but very disappointing lack of accent. So, who is the best non-football man or woman in football? Danny. Can I just say before we start, I think this is one of the best fighting talk questions. Ah ha! I've gone with Benoit Asu Akoto. Yes, hated it. Hated it. Hated it. Absolutely hated it. Decent left back, played 155 times for Spurs, played for Cameroon, international footballer. Just didn't like the game. He said he saw it as a job. He said he went into training but called it work. I went into work at half ten. I was there to like half one. Yeah. And then he went on. Yeah. And then he was like, and then I'd just go around London. I had an oyster card. It was great. Like there's a guy that actually prefers the tube system in London instead of playing Premier League football. Like, what? Yeah. I mean, it's pretty good. Is he? So, Danny, are it's pretty good. Is he? So, Danny, are you saying he is, Ben White is the modern version of that? Yeah, I think that's fair. Ben White Asio Ocotto, it could work as well. North London fullbacks. Mine is, and yet to be seen, whether he is going to be successful in football or not, is Sir David Brailsford. Ah, yes. Yeah, that's a very good answer, actually. We will see. He has got, I was reading up on him, and some interesting things at Team Sky, the cycling team. I'll be a bit careful here about these interesting things, please. Well, you know, developing the way that the athletes wash their hands to minimise getting a cold to maximise performance. I mean, as somebody who loves marginal gains. Let's see if he can change things at United. Is there any way we can do that? He's got an honorary degree from the University of Chester, which is where I went. Wow. Very, very boring. Katie. Right, I'm going Marizio Sari. Never played professionally. He used to work in a bank. Dabbled as an amateur centreback. Got into coaching. Managed 21 different clubs. Europa League with Chelsea and Seriat title with Yuve. But at the crux of this, the reason he's the best non-football man is because he's got no time for this whole body like, body is a temple nonsense, has he? Self-profess, smokes 60 a day, had his own designated smoking area at Napoli. Remember at Chelsea when he used to stick an unlit Sig in his mouth and just be sort of chewing on it while he's watching these guys running around. Before post-match interviews as well, apparently he'd be taken out the stadium so he could have a quick one come back. I mean, that's the guy. Yeah. It's giving Sunday League though. Yeah. A bit of cigarette on the side of the pitch. But your own smoky area immediately makes me think of going to nightclubs in Europe when there's that sort of hot box. It's just like a smoke-filled Perspex box. He would love that. Liam. One thing I think you would never associate with a footballer. Chopsticks. If you mention footballer, you don't think chopsticks. And one of the coolest guys I've been lucky enough to interview. I know where you're going here. Oh, go on. If Izzy can guess this, you don't get any points. Now, this is cool. Liam, your point. You take it away. Okay. Come on. Tom Davies. He is obviously still playing football. but away from football, he's repurposing chopsticks to make furniture, which I think is really cool, looking after the environment. Apparently, thousands of chopsticks go into the bin, never to be seen again. And now you can buy a table made of chopsticks. So, like, I mean, that is incredible. A bit like the sort of mad old guys who make, like, models of boats at matchsticks. That's sort of principle. Yeah. But a larger scale and tables. Really trendy furniture, actually. Is he was that that? You had that in your mind, did you? No, not until you put it up. Oh, who else is making shopperature? As soon as you said it, I knew where you were going, because I know Tom Davis from Everton days. And I agree. Fantastic point. I'm interested to know what other furniture is he making? I think there's desks. Wow. We can maybe get some for season. Pretty clearly I'm going to be Googling. Chopstick furniture later. Paul, who are you giving the points to? And remember, you're Northern Irish. No. Yes. It's got to be chopsticks. Yeah, it's got to be chopsticks. It has got to be chopsticks. Thanks, Paul. Thanks very much, Paul. That was what I said. Someone said what you're going to play on the piano today. That's all I've got. I thought that's where it was going. All right, well, I'm going to move on for that quite quickly. Back to the appointment of a man born in Germany as England manager. And in fact, that generated very little outcry from fans. Although the Daily Mail called it, and I quote, a dark day for England. And in case the readers didn't understand why German was in block capitals. So panel if, and if here is in block capitals, this was a dark day for England. Remind us of some others, Katie. I've got three words for you. Pint of wine. Big Sam, 67 days he lasted as the England manager. It was only eight years ago. The FAA have got very short memories here, or the Daily Mail readers, we should say. Yes, he sung the national anthem, but there was that investigation, wasn't there? Film, claims that he'd offered advice on how to get round player transfer rules. Yes, he had 100% record, I'll grant you that. But it was a scraping past Slovakia. It was off the back of Euro 2016. Dark, dark days. But you're absolutely right. Those three words, pint of wine. Is he? So I was thinking about the Euro final, the COVID one where the England fans are having issues getting into the stadium. I don't think that was a very nice occasion. No, it wasn't. But more on a broader scale in sport, Andy Murray retiring. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Although, I mean... I mean, tennis fans relatable, it was a dark day, I thought. Yeah, but then he went out in such sort of classic Murray style at the Olympics. We had a surreal pleasure. We had plenty of buildup. It was coming. It was coming. But what he was doing with Dan Evans. And Wimbledon, people at Wimbledon are going to miss him. Yeah, I think we're all missing. We've got to get a new name for the Mounds. Septem a Rada Khan who spurned him at the last moment. Yeah, it was like, no, I don't want to play actually. Liam. So I'm going to go with not just a dark day, but a dark age in British sport. Now we're all used to Anthony Joshua filling Wembley Stadium, filling out stadiums all over the world. But we actually had to wait 94 years, which is a dark age in British boxing from 1887 when Bob Fitzfitts Finman's won in the 14th round. We had to wait all the way until Lennox Lewis in 1993 before we had a heavyweight champion from Britain. So I think that's a long time. It's not just a day. It's 94 years without a British World Heavyweight champion. I mean, I didn't ask for a dark nearly century of England, but I'll take it. Danny. I'm going for for a dark nearly century for England, but I'll take it again. Danny. I'm going for the whole World Cup 94 qualifying campaign. Horrible. And also as well, like, my first World Cup was 90, so I just thought we were good. Yeah. I was like, oh, we've got loads of good players and that. And then this happens, you've got Graham Taylor with Carlton Palmer in the middle and like Andy Sinton and these players that I didn't even have like on swap like in my Premier League stickers like struggling to beat Poland and Norway, teams that were good but I didn't know they were good like and then we had that whole debacle against San Marino where they go and score first like the first goal they've ever scored in 16 centuries or something. Yeah. And then the the Kuhoman free kick and it culminates in Taylor getting sacked and the turniped and all that stuff in the papers. It was just, it was horrible. I do still really hate Cooman for that though. Like genuinely, I loathe them. Okay, let's check in with the scores, which are written out by hand, magnificently, by Paul, actually. Danny has six, Katie has six as well, Izzy's got four, a bit of words to do is, and Liam. Don't look over my shoulder. You haven't read that. And Liam on eight. Very nice, thank you. I like the handwritten touch. Now, we have asked this one before, but no better time to ask again. Who is sports greatest German Danny? It's Dirtniewiczki. Greatest European basketballer ever. Seven foot German, Hall of Fame, Dallas Mavericks Legend, statue outside the stadium, 14-time All-Star, NBA champions stopped LeBron James and the Heetles, that famous three-man super team winning in 2011. Just an absolute legend. Yeah, beast of a man. Katie. Well, you know who the best German is in the world, Rick. We talk about her a lot on, like my breakfast. Your grandmother, your o-mar. My grandma, my Omar, to me, Ingeborg, to anyone else, listening. Actually, just Casey's Omar to me. Yeah, she's a great woman. And she had a run in with Franz Beckenbauer one day, sadly died earlier this year, won the World Cup as captain and manager. They were on a golf course, my All-O-O-O-Mah, that's great, grandma. And they were so overwhelmed seeing him walking towards them that they were, he was like so famous in germany they didn't know what to do and ended up falling in a ditch because they were so overwhelmed by his presence so there we go uh issy scoffy graff 22 major singles titles a bit of a role model for me growing up you're strong female presence in the sporting world. Let's go with Steffie Graff. Yeah, absolutely nailed on. Liam. Tough to surpass. I'd say one thing about my man that puts him separate to you guys is he's only on a par with one other person in the history of his sport. It's Michael Schumacher, seven-time world champion, five consecutive world titles. And I think the rest, would they be in the top three if you ask for the goat in their sport this man definitely would be top spot only mr lewis it's actually i mean oh yeah i think i think you're right actually i yeah i think you're right there that's a good argument lear right next topic is all around this keeps of the lay for isac preaches us the hat trick oh what a goal what a hat trick? Oh, what a goal! What a hat trick goal! Top bins! Jump right on corner! That's the pick of the bunch. Brilliant strike for Price. It's a hat trick for him here at Windsor Park. Yeah, so terrific stuff from Isaac Price. Scored a hat trick as Northern Ireland. Thumped Bulgaria 5-0 this week. Isaac called it The Greatest Night of My Life. But what was yours? Now really, I, as it called it, the greatest night of my life. But what was yours? Now, really, I just want to know what was the greatest night of your life, but it can be sporting. You can take it however you want, in fact. Danny. I've had loads of great nights. Especially in 1997. That was probably my peak. I accidentally told a girl I loved her at the school disco after hugging her once. I won a Virgin Megastores gift voucher that day. But the best thing that I've ever done happened in 1997 in the sports hall of Queens Park High School playing five aside. The ball rolled to me and it's one of those, it's a multi-use sports hall obviously. The basketball rings were out. Ball rolled to me. Called it. It's going in there. sports hall, obviously. The basketball rings were out. Ball roll to me. Called it. It's going in there. Chipped it, straight in. Swish. Nothing but that. Best thing I've ever done. Genuinely, best thing I've ever done. And not even close. No. And I say that with respect. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's just amazing. Everyone was in awe. To call it. That's the thing. If you do it without calling it, it's like, don't get me wrong with it. I've done it by accident a few times. I wouldn't have even brought it to the show if that was the case. Yeah. But the fact yeah calling it it's like don't get me wrong with i've done it by accident a few times i wouldn't have even brought it to the show if that was the case yeah but the fact that i called it pointed it it chipped it's really it's really good it's really good you have genuinely got up in my estimation because i didn't think you had it in you leiam i'm going to go with a nice wholesome story actually the reason i'm a liverpool fan my granddad Mike he's a big fighting talk listener hi Mike he's the reason I support Liverpool and I was fortunate enough to interview two of Liverpool's goats Kenny Dow Gleash and Ian Rush at the Titanic Hotel in Liverpool so my granddad's an amateur photographer his peak is if he gets a woodpecker in the garden he's delighted so he's like big amateur photographer yeah woodpeckers don't get enough mention on this show. I arranged the shoot and we need a photographer. So I invite my granddad who's traveled home and away to watch Liverpool. He'd spend all his money get into a game that he wouldn't have anywhere to stay. They'd all stay in a park, get the train home in the morning. So he got to meet two of his absolute heroes. Not only that, we had a pint in the Titanic after the shoot. And my granddad, he won't thank me for telling you this. I went in his hotel room before and he'd iron his shirt. I'm going four or five times. I went and said, hi, Kenny Dalglish, hi, he and he was on his best behaviour. I told them the story of European finals he'd been to watch them. And I think the reason I love football is because of my granddad. So to give him that back to meet his heroes. And the pictures were aced, by the way. That was an amazing night for me. That's a beautiful story and completely mudged off as well. It's all right. Yeah, it's stupid. Yeah, and you're a version of mega-squered. Well, I was just going to ask if his granddad had ever chipped the big tennis ball into a basketball ring from 50 yards away. I mean, he's got a cracking picture of a woodhacker. I hadn't called it. Yeah, lovely stuff. Absolutely lovely. I mean, obviously the question wasn't what was the greatest night of Grandad. I was seeing him happy with maybe being happy. Katie. Right, so this is a slight turn tangent. So I went to Leeds uni and we were all obsessed with the Brownlee brothers, the triathlon stars, particularly Alice of Brownlee Olympic champion. The better one. Yeah. Well, Johnny's got a gold. Anyway, it doesn't matter. That was in a real age. It doesn't really count, does it? Anyway, he was this big thing at Lee's student radio. I was really cool. I did radio, obviously. And we used to play a game where if anyone spotted him in Leeds, someone would get on their bike from the radio station and like try and find him and interview him for the radio. And one night I was at, um, Fruitie Night Out, which is like the Friday night kind of vibe in Leeds. Awful, you can imagine it. And we thought it would be sort of highly ironic as students to go to Fruitie dressed as fruit. So we all dressed up as bananas that night. You have to hate students. You really just do. You've just jealous. We've all been through it. You've never been dressed as a banana. I've been dressed as a bananas that night. You have to hate students. You really, you just do. You've just jealous. We've all been through it. You've never been dressed as a banana. I've been dressed as a banana. I've been dressed as a banana, as he, come on, behave yourself. I guess better. So we're in the kind of mosh pit area. And I look up, it was like a film. In the spotlight, coming down the stairs, is Alistair Brownlee on a night out. And I was like, this is my moment. No signal. Can't do an interview. So I'll just, I'll go up in person. So I go up, hi, Alistra and Katie. He's like, hi, I'm Alistair. I was like, yeah, I moment. No signal, can't do an interview. So I was like, you know what? I'll just, I'll go up in person. So I go up, hi, Alistair and Katie. He's like, hi, I'm Alistair. I was like, yeah, I know. And then I just had this moment where I was like, oh my God, I look down. I'm like, dressed as a banana. This is my moment. I'm dressed as a banana. So I turned to him and I was like, I'm dressed as a banana. He looks me up and down. He goes, at least you're a hot banana. Wow. Wow. I just said, wow wow best night in my life walked away that was it job done everything i ever needed favourite triathlon snack yeah i would not have been walking away after that compliment let me tell you it has to be scoring at wembley and fay cut final oh sorry sorry guys i know the woodpecker. Sit down everyone off. Pinchers are great. Um, petched one into the top horn at Wembley. Did you call it? I didn't. I didn't while I struck the ball. And then the party afterwards was so impromptu. It was, it was magical, not dressed as fruit. Still had my club tracks for the heart. If you had one criticism. Yeah, I mean, ideally I would have gone as, you know, a bunch as fruit, still had my club tracks for the heart. If you had one criticism. Ideally I would have gone as, you know, a bunch of grapes, but hey, absolutely brilliant night. Like, what are you supposed to do with that? Yeah, you just have to sit back and admire exactly the way you would have done if Danny would have just called that. The horizon levels there. Alright, starting with you Danny, I thought yours was really good. It turns out it wasn't. That's a strong round. Very, very strong round. He had a bit of everything. Genuine sporting excellence. Yeah, thank you. No. Can we ask Paul which one he'd pick if he was picking that one? Yes, absolutely. I remember Paul, you're Northern Irish. Which would you go for there, Paul? Hot banana. Wow. That is incredible, Paul. I remember Paul, you're Northern Irish. Which would you go for there, Paul? Hot Banana. Wow. That's, that is incredible, Paul. Yeah. To go for Hot Banana. Wow. Scored at Wembley and they've got by now. You're mad. You've been hard done by there. Yeah, definitely. My friend once didn't know what the Brownlee brothers were called. So he called them the Aldi brothers because they did an advert for Aldi. That's all he knew about them. He was like, oh, those, the Aldi brothers. Yorkshire's finest. All right, that is it for the first off. And what a half it was, literally 50% of the show. We'll be back with the remaining 50% of fighting talk after the news and the actual sport. Sport. Welcome back. Welcome back to our panel, Danny McLaughlin, Kachie Smith, Liam McDevitt and Izzy Christensen. I'm sorry to say I have been at the AI again. This time I asked for a serious welcome back to Fighting Talk, and ooh boy, has it delivered. Here we go. After a much-anticipated break, Fighting Talk is back and ready to ignite your sports passion once again. Whether you're a die-hard sports fan or a casual listener, there's something for everyone in this vibrant arena of athletic discussion. It's too good. If you want to hear what the AI came up with for the top of the show, you can go back and listen for the start on BBC Sounds onwards. It is game change of time, which I'll never to be forget by the end of the round. So Wigan Rugby League coach Matt Pete revealed he got Sir Alex Ferguson in to deliver what was he called an epic team talk in the run-up to Wiggins historic Super League grand final win against Hull K.R. Wiggin completed an unprecedented quadruper with their win on Saturday. So it's over to you. It's got a bit of time on his hands now. So where are you sending Sir Alex in this week to give his motivational team talk or a bit of hair dryer, is he? Well, Danny will be delighted that the Premier League is back this weekend. A little fist pump there. Can see it in your face. You're so excited. Yeah. We're looking at Southampton against Leicester. And I'm going, Russell Martin. He's under a little bit of pressure, isn't he? He needs to get some points on the board. I think a lot of people. And I'm just wondering whether if he was given the choice, you know, before this game to say, Sir Alex Ferguson's going to come in and do the team talk, would you allow it? And I think you've got to say yes. Would be by your hand off? Absolutely. Absolutely would. Danny. There's only one place Fergie's needed this weekend and it's back to where he used to be. It's back at Aberdeen. Lovely. Their level on points with Celtic at the top, they were the last team to break that whole firm in the 80s. They need a bit of 80s, Fergie to go there and give them a little team talk. So if they can go to Celtic Park and win, a three points clear, like, it could be good. Honestly, it almost makes me want to watch Scottish football. Katie. I'm flying him stateside this weekend. We've got the US Grand Prix. And I think he needs to have a little word with Max Verstappen. So he's still leading the driver's standings. But the gap now cut 52 points and crucially hasn't actually won a race since June. So something is going wrong here for Maxper Stappen. I think it'd be particularly amusing because the Stappen's currently on a swearing ban. So he got in trouble with the FIA, too much swearing, so he's not allowed to swear. And obviously Sir Alex famously never uses a naughty word. So I just think the two of them together, hair dryer, arm around the shoulder, could be wonderful. Match made in heaven. Yeah, and he's sort of only giving short answers at interviews, isn't he? They could only reply with... He's basically having a little sulk. Yeah. Liam. Not as glamorous as stateside, but Cambridge United versus Wiggin, Cambridge are having a torrid start. The worst start in their EFL history, 17 goals conceded, six goals scored, and their manager, Gary Monk, a red card and a thousand pound fine. And I think if ever a monk needed some divine intervention, it would be this weekend. I think it would be a good place for Sir Alex to go and help them out a bit. All right, we're going to stick with Sir Alex, who has been ditch for his ambassadorial role at Old Trafford, not allowed in the dressing room anymore. It's a cost-cutting move. Outraged many, including Majesty United Legend, Derek Kantonow, who said, Sir Alex should be able to do what he wants until the day he dies. But where else have legends been given some shabby treatment? Katie. Now, I'm going to caveat this with, I don't necessarily like disagree with it, but I think you've got to say no about Jochovich. He's a 24-time Grand Slam singles champion. His longevity proven key. I mean, literally the rest of the big four are now pretty much all retired in Adal very, very soon. And the crowd still won't love him. He's tried giving them hearts. He even got a metal bottle dropped on his head earlier this year. They were having absolutely none of it. So in the great man's own words, have a good night. He even got a metal bottle dropped on his head earlier this year. They were having absolutely none of it. So in the great man's own words, have a good night. All right, yeah, the thing is, he's the, no, Murray was probably funnier, but Jochovich genuinely a funny guy. Do you think? A weird guy. He makes me laugh. Really? With some of his jokes. I enjoyed Have a Good Night, for example. I think he's quite good in press conferences. I think that doesn't get talked about very much. Izzy? CR7. Mr. Cristiana Ronaldo. Second spell at Manchester United. Largely up for debate about whether he was mistreated or whether it was the correct treatment from ETH about his return. But he is the Djokovic of the footballing world or vice versa. They're kind of, you know, divide people's opinions, but they're clearly impeccably good at what they do and in peak condition all the time. Danny? So much has been made out of this story. I think it's a nonsense story. Like they're making it sound like it's the end of Goodfellows the way that they've got rid of Fergie. Like, they've just said, oh, can you- The bats are out? Can we stop giving you all this money that you don't need, like for the sake of the club? Like, it's like, and also, Fergie is, he's definitely going to go, yeah, because he was the worst for it. Out of everyone, he's going to appreciate this treatment. The way he got rid of Kinchelskis, he got rid of Inchus, he got rid of Yuz all in one summer, see you later. We've got these lads coming through. Not a sentimental man, basically. Stammie binned off at a services. Like, he met him at a garage and said, Soz, you're going? Like, Beckham, he kicked the boot out. That is a bit good fellas, meeting someone at a service. Yeah, are you sure? Yeah. Yeah, round the back in. Yeah, Beckham got a boot kicked at him in the back of a frozen meat truck. But Andy Cole, they were all just shipped out and I think it's telling that Cantonar is the one that says it because he's the only one that went out on his terms. Yeah. You haven't answered the question there, have you? Yeah. Have you? They're all legends. Oh, all of them. Okay, all right, fine, fine. Don't disagree with me. Liam. Liverpool fans hear me out. Michael Owen. He has a right, fine, fine. Don't disagree with me. Liam. Liverpool fans hear me out. Michael Owen. He has a tough time with Liverpool fans. And I think when Anfield Road was being redeveloped, they put a big mural up of all the best strikers. He wasn't in there. He won a Ball and Door, 158 goals, 297 appearances. And Izzy, you'll know. Liverpool fans, we wouldn't have wanted him after the years after Madrid. He would have been pushed out. He moved to the only club. I think you can leave the team that you've been at for your whole career, Real Madrid, to go to. And after that, he wasn't the Michael and we saw from 17 to 22. I think the O'N final, everything he did for the club. I know what you're thinking, Danny. Are you thinking the goal against the 50s? It's not just the goal. It's the source in which he was lifting that trophy with. He went to the United. Exactly with United and he was like, I just think, like, have some shame. I can't handle it. I hate it so much. By all accounts, he tried to get back. Yeah, no, I've heard of that, but I don't care. He wouldn't have made the, like he was enjoying himself. Yeah, just lift. Just lift it a bit. Just go like that a little bit. Don't be like, look at this. Yeah, just lift it a bit. Just go like that a little bit. Don't be like, oh, here, look at this. Yeah, no, no. Sorry, not for me. Has everyone been, I'm so clouded by rage. I can't like out. Has everyone given their answer to that? Yeah. Okay, good. Thank you very much. And just to previously rewind slightly, I said at the start of the game changer that I would forget by the end of the round that it was the game changer. And I did indeed. So remind me of your answers for where you were sending Sir Alex. Izzy, where were you sending Sir Alex? Yeah. Where were you sending Sir Alex to give the... Southampton. Sending him down south. Yeah. Danny, where are you sending him? Back to Aberdeen. Aberdeen. Liam, where were you sending him? Back to Aberdeen. Aberdeen. Liam, where are you sending him? Cambridge. Cambridge. And you were sending him to the USA. Yeah, okay. I think the best genuine answer there is Russell Martin, Southampton. So Izzy, I'm going to give you the five points. And you get to decide who you're taking them off of. And how many points can I remove? Five. You're getting five. Two for either of the fellows. Two from Danny, two from Liam. And one from... Oh. One from... Yeah, it's egalitarian stuff. And actually, that puts you miles in front. Very good gameplay from Izzy, in fact. Now, on to a bit of drama that you may have heard about in the world of Conquers. So 82-year-old world champion, David Jenkins, has been accused of cheating, including keeping an illicit steel conquer in his pocket. So his defeated opponent said that Jenkins destroyed his conquer in one swipe, something he claims never happens, and accused the man known as King Conquer of having a metal nut. Organises the World Championship said that 82-year-old Jenkins is the last person in the world you would accuse of cheating. But who would you be gutted to find out was a cheat? Katie. It's Usain Bolt. Absolutely. Mega star. You and I actually regularly share little videos of Usain Bolt, don't we? Remember the cheeky smile when he runs 9-5-8 and you think if you just ran through the line, what could you have done? He's once in a generation. I mean, ludicrous, but believable, wasn't he? The way he used to run and in a sport continually rocked by doping scandals. I remember the 2015 World Champs where he pips, Justin Gatlin, two-time band sprinter to the line, and Crammy calls it, he says he saves his title, he saved his reputation. He may have even saved his sport. I literally think athletics could not recover if he was actually. No, I completely agree. I don't even think we should continue with the rest of the round. Yeah. He was filled by chicken nuggets, wasn't he? Yeah. He loved chicken nuggets. Yeah. And he loves the Swedish handball team as well. Yeah. Those are the big two really, aren't they? Yeah, you know what? It's such a good answer. I don't think anyone's going to top it. Liam, have a go for me. I've gone with one of my childhood goats, mainly because the film Space Jam had a great soundtrack. But Michael Jordan, six-time MVP, six-time NBA champ, 14-time All-Star. I think he defined his sport. Last dance, I've watched about four or five times. And I'd be gutted because he's got that competitivism, which he backed up with results. And I think if it was to find out that he had been taking drugs to make himself a bit better, it would be tough. Yeah. But as Katie rightly pointed out, I mean, you're not, there's no conviction in your voice now. No, because you know what? The sport is not going to suddenly fold. You can find that out. It's gutting. Whereas you're right, athletics. I don't know if it would recover. No, no. I don't know it would. Danny. I think this might rival it, you know. Oh yeah. Just for the two, the double-edged sword it is. It's Roger Federer. Oh. Okay. Okay, too unthought to me. He's commonly, like, he's regarded. It's in the argument that he's the besterer. Oh. Okay. Okay. Talk to me. He's commonly, like, he's regarded, it's in the argument that he's the best ever. Yeah. But he's also got that image where he's whiter than white. Yeah. He's a great guy. Yeah. He wouldn't, he's seen with his family. It's just, he wouldn't do it. Out of all the people, it would never be him. Plus, you've got that horrible thing that you know that the papers, the rubbish papers, are going to call him Roger Pedera, right? because of the performance enhancing drugs. That will be a headline in the papers. You had to explain that one. That is happening, right? I'm telling you. No one's saying Roger Pedera. The main thing is as well, if he can do it out of all those people, then they are going to be looking at Jockovich. They are going to be looking at Nadegh, they are going to be looking at Murray, Jamie and Andy for the doubles. No, we're looking at Jamie. He's totally innocent. It just opens up a whole thing then. It's good, it's good, but it's still not bought. I beg to differ, though. Would you argue more people like Raffa Nidal? Because he's my. I'm sorry, I think Federer's top dog no, you're sticking with a tennis are you with me Kethe? A hundred percent. It's the like the likeability, the tan, the tan, the way he played tennis. But the muscular hypertrophy in his left arm is a hot of the way. Can anyone relate to that? He's a hot banana. He's a hot banana. He's a hot of the way. Can anyone relate to that? He's a hot banana. He is a hot banana. But I think, I still think that Danny's right. I think Federer is the one who is like the pure, perfect tennis player. And he's short. Stay where they're meant to be. The Swiss Army knife. Yeah. No, I think I think, but he's still part of a big four. Does he stand alone as the megastore of the sport? No, look, I still think your answer is the best answer, but no extra points for it. All right, next question. A bit of boxing now. Promoter and sometime fighting talk panelist, Eddie Hearn, went on a rant this week, claiming that Bivar was robbed after defeat by Baturbeyev in their light heavyweight title fight. It was an excellent fight, by the way. Said of one judge, he should never work in the sport again, but who else would you say the same of? Liam. Rick, do you know what I really, really don't like? I've only seen, I've only seen in the Premier League this season. And I actually think I know who decided this, and I'm sorry if you're listening, whoever decided to let influencers toss a coin at the start of a Premier League game. For me, there's no time, no place. There's enough access for people to go and get. I've not even seen this. I've not seen either. Now you have. You'll notice it. What's an influencer? And do you know what? If they asked me, I'd go there and I would toss that coin like my life depended on it. Of course. But before a Premier League game, no time, no place for you to be doing the coin toss. So whoever let that happen needs to get a bit. Who do we think made that decision? I think there's probably someone whose job is influencer marketing activations or something. It's horrible. It's horrible. Not my cup of tea. Not my cup of tea. Izzy, you'll see it now. I'm taking points off, not you there, but just off the idea. activating activations or something. It's horrible. It's a marketing activations. Not my cup of tea. I'll see it now. I'm taking points off, not you there, but just off the idea of influencer marketing activations. Katie. I'm going to go for, you know the people that measure out marathon courses and 10Ks and stuff? Because we are now getting more and more of them where the distances are wrong and athletes get their times wiped out. It is one of the great examples of you have one job. Yeah, and how they managed... And it's pretty straightforward. How they managed to then correct it after? And so no worse was this than we've got to go two years ago, this very weekend, the great Scottish run, where Aelish McColgan breaks the European and British 10,000 metre record and then finds out it's 150 metres short and it's null and void. How absolutely rubbish is that you had one job? Really, really, really poor, is it? Wow. I am going for the manufacturers, the creators, the inventors and also the couriers of half and half scarfs. The whole industry. The whole industry. They're all a vicious chain of production to find their way outside football stadiums with two teams on the scarf is just totally wrong. If it was a World Cup final and you were there neutral, you're not buying a scarf? I think I'm buying a scarf. No. But you're not just picking a team though yeah you just I have no allegiance is it's a good little momentum yeah but yeah get a program or something I think it has one place and that's your first game in the bin no who are you getting rid of in sport English referees out the Premier League all of them gone yeah why we've got a German manager now the some of the best ever players that we've are you getting rid of in sport? English referees at the Premier League. All of them gone. Yeah. Why, we've got a German manager now. Some of the best ever players that we've ever had play in the Premier League are not from England. The managers, there's not been an English manager that's won a Premier League since whatever. Why can't we bring the best friends? I don't know why the refs are getting it? Well, why can't we bring, why is it, why have they all got to be English? Why can't we transfer Pierre Luigi Kalina in who was the best ref ever? Why can't we bring him in from Italy? Why can't we get the best Spanish rest? We've got all this money in the game. Why can't we offer them money to come and to do this? It's mad to me. Shipping refs. But do you not think you would, you know, slightly miss David Kutel? No, and also, we haven't got that thing where it's like, there's a ref that lives near Manchester, and then it just means, oh, he's definitely going to do that. There's none of that. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. He's from Valladoyed. Well, point for the pronunciation. Paul could never. A quickie then, panel, all about this. Between innings, Honeywell's coming off, right, good inning. My God, there's a snake. It's a real one, too, not a prank. We've had snakes on a plane, snakes on a train, and the latest Hollywood is snake in the dugout. I mean, I suppose the best thing about that is that it happened in America with American commentators because they've done a magnificent job then. So a snake, as you will have gathered, slithered into the LA Dodgers dug out on Monday during their playoff game with the Mets. But who would you least like to be alongside on the bench because they're a snake? I think I'll just take one line on this because we don't want to trouble the lawyers too much on a Saturday. Liam. I've gone with Cristiano Ronaldo for his Euro's final in 2016. There's nothing worse than him jumping around with his pretend knee bandage, talking to the manager whispering. And Izzy, imagine you're managing a team and you've got some person telling you how to coach the team. Unacceptable behaviour should be fined and should not have him been allowed to lift the trophy to be honest. Well there we go. Izzy? I'm going with the Five Live commentator Ian Dennis. And I'm going with Deno because he teed me up on the last England international game. He said to me, I've got some dirt on you. I'm going to disclose it on air. So obviously leading into the match, I'm extremely worried about what he's going to disclose to the listeners of Five Live. And then he just said, oh, it's bad. It must be bad. That's what I mean? And I was thinking, what have I done? What have I done? Anyway, clear conscience. And he just, all he did was he disclosed to the listeners that it was my birthday in September. And I said, the biggest anti-climax ever, I don't trust you, Denno. Don't be in my dugout. Awful. Awful from Dono. Danny. I've gone with Jake, the snake. Yeah, the wrestler. It's a root one. It's massive. Dugouts are small. Probably smells, sweaty after wrestling. And he's got an actual snake on his neck. Get it away. I don't want it. I don't want it near me. It's sort of feel like that wouldn't be allowed now, but it's a good sort of house. And he's also a retive, he's into spoken word. So can you imagine him in the dugout? A unit with a snake doing poetry. Doing high cooos? Absolutely not. No, no, no, no, no. Katie. I'm going Eddie Jones, former England rugby head coach. A plotter, if ever I met one. You know the bit of side eye when the camera pans to him? And I know he's not in the dugout, but he's up on that sort of high thing where they put through the coaches. And like, you just couldn't ever be confident that he isn't plotting his next move, i.e. Exactly what happened at the World Cup, Australia is doing atrociously. And it turns out he was heading to Japan. Yes. Any other business? Liam, do you want to kick us off here? Yeah, for anyone listening who's been dating in their late 20s, early 30s, it's a minefield. But this is something I've recently found out from a friend. They'd been dating for a few months, and they couldn't find the words to end the dating. So it's funny we've been talking about AI, actually. They used said app to do the breakup message to end the dating process. And do you know what I thought? In a world where we're just meeting on online apps through Instagram, we're now doing breakups using AI. And Rick, after your scores today, I thought I'd ask the same thing. So hi, Rick. I've been doing a lot of thinking and I feel it's best for us to go our separate ways. This isn't an easy decision because I genuinely care about you and the memories we've made. But right now, I think moving forward independently is what we need to do. I hope you understand that. What do? And we can both find happiness our own ways. I completely even gave me a note that breakups are difficult. Yeah. And this message is honest, but considerate. It also, it did, it sort of made me feel better about it. It's upsetting, but I appreciate that. I've almost encouraged the use of using AI for breakups, but it upset me. I've encouraged the use of using AI for breakups, but it upset me. I've not stopped thinking about it since actually. That's worked very well for me. Katie. Yeah, it's not me. It's definitely you. I just want to rant about Euston Station. I don't know if anyone else has to use it. Hell on earth. The layout appalling. The time they give you now to get to the train is what, like 1.5 seconds. The tactics you then have to employ, like do you get on the train straight away and sort of shove your bag down the carriage? Do you run down the platform? Are you moving people out the way? They've had to issue safety warnings about it now. And the worst part, as you come down the ramp towards the platform, there is now a countdown clock timing you. Everyone's seen the Lion King. The stampede scene doesn't work well for Simba or Mufasa. Okay, yeah. It's a horrible, horrible station. Izzy? Yeah, sticking with the theme of stations, I have a very big issue with motorway service stations. Yeah, you'd like to know more, I'm sure. I ran in the other day. Warwick Services, I think it was at. Yep, stop there for a toilet break on my way to London. And I've run in because I don't like them. I'd want to be in and out very quickly. And the queue for the fast food outlets is out of the door. This is around lunchtime. The queue for prete and mongue, healthier options, is empty? And I'm thinking, come on, guys. Why is fast food so popular? Why is motorway service stations and any travel stations or depots or whatever you want to call them need to sell healthier food? There is my big rant. Why is fast food so popular? I don't think we've got time to answer that. Danny. I've gone with maybe the reason why people are breaking up with other people and I've gone with trainer socks on adult men. Disgusting. I just don't understand. I don't get it. Like, why you're so proud of your ankles? Like, they look like knuckles. Like, when did it become like, oh, no, sorry, I've got to get my, what's wrong with a sock? Like, we've got two really good options. So, no, sock, exactly. You don't need it in between. Exactly. So we've had years with sock and it was fine. And we got to about 9098. And then someone's gone, hey, you know, that's embarrassing that last four inches of sock there. You should be ashamed of yourself. Is no sock okay? Yeah, no, no smoke is fine. But you then need to condition it. Roundy, roundy socks. No, them little invisible socks. No, no, no, no. I don't need my toe straightening. We don't need, we've evolved. We did socks. It was fine. It's the same as like when people put food on wood. We got plates. We don't need any more innovation. And mainly, I've got this mad like daydream that what happens? I get arrested for something I haven't done and I get put in prison. And I'm in prison. And then I'm in the day room where they play ping pong and that. And it kicks off. I get accosted by like five men. And I grab the thing that I can to defend myself and it's a snooker ball, and I go to put it in my sock, I've only got my trainer socks. I can't swing that. I can't defend myself. I've got this little tiny sock, like, and it doesn't end well for me. I reckon that's... A nice image, though. Let's have a look at the final scores, and this is an absolute mess, Paul. Just decipher it. Izzy, it's a creditable debut, but which I mean you've come last, 28. In spite of taking five points a bit, so you've actually done really badly there. Katie on 31, Danny on 34, Liam on 35, which means that Danny and Liam go into the head-to-head defending and defensible. Ridiculous statement, you have to answer it. However much it hurts, it should hurt, it must hurt. Liam, you finished on the most points, so you are first. You have 20 seconds on. If Thomas Tuchel wins the World Cup for England, the open top bus parade must be in Berlin. I think that's an exceptional idea. I think it should start in Berlin. What we need after such a long wait for England to lift a trophy is a bus parade that takes several days. So start it in Berlin. We'll pack out Berlin. We'll travel all across Europe, drinking our way throughout the continent, and then we'll arrive on the south coast of England, travel up from seven sisters all the way to London and it will be the best open top ball we've ever seen. It's got a long way that, guys. All right. Okay, Danny, you have 20 seconds on Sir Jim Rackcliffe has finally rooted out the real problem at Old Trafford by keeping Eric Tenhaag and getting rid of Sir Alex. Yeah, sick of him. Like, get rid. Like, why are you still there? It's been years. You give us Moise. Like, not enough's been said about Fergie giving us Moyes. If there's no Fergie, we're not in this mess anyway. If his ego didn't get in the way, we hire Marino straight after Fergie. He didn't want that because he didn't want Marino. Moyes got to the Champions League quarterfinal with that team. Marino might have won it. Fergie doesn't want that. He's only won the Champions League twice. Marino coming in straight away. Didn't realize you hated Alex Ferguson so much. It's a tough one. I don't really have time to properly sort of analyse the efforts. So I'm going to make an arbitrary snap decision. And I'm going to give it to my ex, Liam. Well done, congratulations. Hold your head high for the next few days. The rest of you, I don't know what to say. Luckily, AI has provided these words. Losing can be disarming, but it's also a learning experience. Many successful contestants have faced setbacks before triumph. So there's that. Thanks for listening. This has been a World End production for BBC Radio 5 Live. If you want more of this in AIMBBBBB, it's available in the form of the podcast Extra on BBC Sounds. Next up, you've got to assume it's Five Live sport. Hello, you're listening to the podcast extra of fighting talk. We're just, there's a couple of things I wanted to get into, actually. First of all, can we talk about who you had to give petrol money to Liam or can we not talk about it now we can uh as mentioned in the main episodes uh sir kenny dalglish uh kindly agreed to do an interview with me and that his one stipulation was that we could contribute towards his petrol so we took a trip to the cash machine handed it over willingly what and uh and how far had he traveled and how did i don't know where he lives we we reserved him a space as you would. He pulled in. Hopefully it's gone to charity or a horse. No, it was very kind of him to do it. But I was stumped. How much do you give Sir Kenny Dalglish to drive? You don't want to go too low, do you? Yeah. I think you've got to go over, if anything. I think I'm giving him. Well, I don't know where he's going. Is it in Liverpool, the shoot? Yeah. And you assume he lives near Liverpool Yeah. I think I'm giving him... Well, I don't know where he's... Is it in Liverpool, the shoot? Yeah. And you assume he lives near Liverpool. Near Liverpool. So I think I'm giving him 50. Yeah, I would go 50. Yeah. I was kind of. A full tank. What'd you go? Go ton. A ton. It's so, Kenny. Have the money. Absolutely fine. Just Googling. He lives in Southport. Oh, so... It's 46 minutes. Oh, so actually... To the Titanic Hotel. Yeah. You give him 20 and he's all right. Yeah. Even that. What's so... It's 46 minutes. Oh, so actually... To the Titanic Hotel. Yeah. You give him 20 and he's all right. Yeah. Even that. What's that? We did have several hours of his time. Yeah. So it's a bit for petrol and it's a bit... Yeah, but he's not... He's not... He's not petrol-powered, though. No. You didn't have to fuel him to do the talk. Like, it's just his travel. Yeah, but at least he can stop at the services on the way home. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'd like a delicious fast food, is he? stop at the services on the way home yeah yeah yeah I'd like a delicious fast food is he absolutely respond to a good home yeah um all right we're going to do the fighting talk rankings five rankers one each actually double rankings this week I think this is quite hard so I want the best five and worst five England men's football managers so best and worse from each of you. Katie, I start with you. So which one? Whichever you like. Best. Go best first. Okay. Well, best, I was told that no one had picked Sir Alf Ramsey. And you sort of, I mean, if we do the list of five and he's not in there. It sort of feels not. At the very least, it's relative to complain into the show. And all we want to do is win a trophy. Yeah. Sir Ralph. So we did that. Also, what has been drawn to my attention is that Thomas Tuchel is probably the first English manager that's got a bit of a comb over like Sir Ralph Ramsey. So potentially like a really good omen. It is a naughty comb over, isn't it? Yeah. I sort of think that in this day and age, don't shave it off, get plugs, almost do anything except the comb over. He's so tall though that not many people are going to see it anyway. He loves his baseball. You'd be able to see it. I'd peer over. I wouldn't have a clue in this case. He bears full sight. I'll take a nice little photo for you. Right at the top of the head. And worst England manager. I said it already, so I'll stick with Big Sam again. 67 days in charge. 100% winning record. Yeah. But I think it's what it represented. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I would love to have been the show for a little bit longer. Liam. Start with the worst. I think it's got to be Steve McLaren. I think there's a few sadder images than him with his brolly. The Wally with the Brolly. Wally with the Brolly. But if you look at the team you had Terry, Gerard, Carrick, Ashley Cole, Rooney, Beckham, not to qualify. He's got to put him down there short. It's really, really, really, I probably can't say this, piss poor. And best, sorry, I've gone. Yeah, best, best. Bobby Robson, 1990. Yeah. This iconic. I know we were short both times, but Hand of God, then to lose on penalties to the winners. I think he had a tough ride at fewer iconic man with fewer iconic kits or players than 1990. Make me feel slightly sick and just to confirm you weren't born then? That was minus four. Incredible. 13. Me too. Izzy, best. Best, I'm going with the most recent, Mr Southgate. Eight years in charge, two finals. Do you know what? Come on. Those stats don't lie. Those stats do not lie. And worst, I... And great to watch as well. Really great to watch. Superb waistcoat for a bit. It was when the waistcoat went missing. The results didn't come our way. But Capello as the worst. Yes. So we might double up there because I think I'm going to go Capello worst as well. Danny. I think I've mentioned the word. I think it was Graham Taylor just for the whole thing. Like the teams he was picking, the players he was picking, the teams he was losing to San Marino scoring against him. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But then the thing with Taylor is, you feel like he got such a horrible. Absolutely. And he seemed like such a nice guy. Yeah, but then his England team did bad. People were laughing. Like, England fans were watching it going, this is a disgrace. All right. And best? Svenis, I've gone with. But I've got a theory about Sven, right? Because he was the first foreign England manager. A lot of people says how he misused that team that he had. I genuinely think in his head, he didn't think the press and everyone would let him not play 4-4-2. Like, I think because everyone was banging on about how he was foreign, because he didn't play that at Lazio. He played different styles. And I think if he'd have had his own way really I think he would have maybe changed it up but it was so four four too I think people would be like oh look at this crazy man bringing his Swedish ideas to the England team we play two banks of four and two strikers and that yeah I just and we leave loads of room in between them yeah I just thought he's like oh it's not worth the hassle I'll just play skulls on the left. See if that works. Yeah. And also, we give us grease, which is like the best, like. One of the, yeah, one of the great moments. It's literally the only time I've ever really cared about watching England. Like, that's the only time I've cheered, really. Were you there? It was glorious. I was in off-the-wall pub in Chester. First. Yeah, another mention of Chester. So I, I'm surprised I thought someone else might go for my best one. Oh tell Terry Venables. I mean a short stint but Euro 96 for me I was 17 I'm just like it's a peak for me you couldn't like we had no expectations going into that tournament he's a great guy. It was all just brilliant. That Holland game, that 4-1 is one of the... It's just blissful. And I've stayed at his hotel in Spain. So Elthel. And then worst, we are doubling up because I'm going Capello. Because, I mean, obviously Capello is a fantastic manager. You look at his record and did really well with almost all of his teams but it was such a disappointment because we came off the back of you know having no success at all with the golden generation always amazing players and then we bring in this season winner and you're like discipline it will whip him into shape this is it and then you have the 2010 World Cup, and it's some of the worst England football I've ever seen. I mean, it was a disgrace. It was an absolute disgrace. The Germany game, and was it Algeria? It was just, oh man, I can't. I still feel cross. USA? Still, yeah, yeah. Still feel really, really cross about that. And he didn't even have the good grace to leave after that. He hung around for another two years. Nuts, absolutely nuts. So Capello, Comerner in twice there. Did he sing the national anthem? I can't remember. Did he, I mean, I don't know. I'm going to go with no. Probably. We didn't really speak English, did he? Does Stuart Pearce sing it? I don't think anyone was bothered then. It just feels like a thing now, isn't it? Iszy, were you a belter of the National Anthem? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you got yourself, yeah. Yeah, you get yourself right pumped up, yeah. Definitely. Right, let's do the rankings then. We'll do best first. We've got Sir Ralph Ramsey, obviously. Bobby Robson, obviously. Southgate, slightly less obviously. Sven, yes, and then magnificent Terry Venables. And the five worst, we've just got, well, we've got Big Sam, Steve McCarran, Capello, Graham Taylor, and then because he was so bad, Capello again. That is your lot for this week. Thanks everyone.
