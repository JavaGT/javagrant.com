This podcast is supported by advertising outside the UK. BBC Sounds, music, radio, podcasts. Hello everybody. Welcome to the show that has done many a memorable thing behind closed doors. I'm Colin Murray and this is Finding Talk. Saturday morning we're here again with two regular shows to go it's up for grabs for the FTT champion of champions with three of today's panel in the hunt for a place on our end of season finale a fortnight from today. So let's get on with it. From now until midday, we mark the final day of the Premier League season. So we've got representatives of the top four here. And who would have thought that Manchester United would have crept in at the expense of Leicester? I should state that's got nothing to do with the fact that Mark Swartzor, the former Fox's Keeper, pulled out yesterday. Representing, defending a Premier League title holder's Manchester City, who have just finished the season, now 38 points off top spot. It's Natalie Pavlik. Hi, Natley. Living in a full-on dreamland. Hi-ya! I thought that was very accurate, being honest. Yeah. So here's what you need to know where you stand at the moment. You had your three wins out of three. Of course, when you first came on fighting talk. The honeymoon then ended disastrously during your last performance. You didn't even make it the DTI. So you're one of two panelists today, a winning your in situation. So if you win today, you will be in the championship of champions. Right. I mean, I was absolutely and utterly screwed over, and I haven't spent seven weeks thinking about how I didn't get into the final last time. Well, you're going to take even longer to get over today. Representing Liverpool, a man who hasn't left his man cave in six weeks, venturing from it only for his weekly shahar, and to pick up his constant monster-munch deliveries from delivery. Ian Sterling's here. Hi, Ian. Hello, Colin Murray. How are you? You've trimmed your beard a bit. You'll be glad to know. This is me trim my beard a bit. I literally filmed something for ITV Envision today. This is me dressed up for television. But I've still got shorts on baby yes nobody needed to see that nobody next up who a man I hope definitely won't show me his legs in any stage during this show he's in the wrong type of red he's looking for a hat-trick of FT wins for the first time ever a 13 year veteran a 55 appearance and the match ball is in sight peace for Jim White Good morning Collie A 55th appearance and the match ball is in sight. Peace for Jim White. Good morning, Colin. I'm very good, yes, yeah. I'm very, very excited about the idea that this football season's still going on. I know, I know. Well, it's more laziness in our behalf. We just didn't want to come up with anything, so we thought we'd just stick to the end of seat. We're doing an FA Cup final special next week, so the mind boggles as to how we're going to pull that one off. Finally then, blue is the colour. Three shows so far this season. One third, one second and one first. So needs last place today for the cycle. A reference that is just delighted Britain's 27 baseball fans. Pat Nevin. Yeah, it's good to be in here, Colin. Thanks for explaining to us all, you know, how it's actually working here, what you have to do to win. That's slightly more complicated than how you win the World Series, which I've never figured out. You've got a proper lip mic and explain what I mean by that is the John Motton. I don't think about it in those terms. I think I'm over John Murray. It feels odd. It feels as if there should be a game in front of me but I'll have to watch you lot because there's some things actually okay. Come on. I can see your teeth and nothing else. Good luck to everyone. You can feel the tension. Last day of the season. Champions of Champions up for grabs and in a parallel universe with it being the final day of the Premier League season tomorrow, we're going to thrash out the big issues. But what do you ask is the first question? Well, we're going to leave that to you. If we were in the normal world, what would be our question one and how would you answer it? Natalie. So Liverpool will lift the Premier League trophy for the first time in their history. And I said Premier League before anybody disagrees However given the fact that Man City are in the final of the FA Cup The Champions League and I've already won the League Cup is there a chance that this achievement will be totally outshone and forgotten by the rest of the world And of course the answer is yes. Because Liverpool went all out to win the league, but great teams go all out to win everything. City won every domestic trophy going last season and Liverpool still claimed that winning the Champions League was better. So clearly, only winning the Premier League this season is really nothing to shout too loud about and maybe if they win it back to back and also win another trophy at the same time then we can try remembering them. All right we'll move swiftly on the ayn sterling what would be the question one? My favourite fighting talk question is where it starts like it's going to be a serious sporting question and then goes left to field for seemingly no reason whatsoever so my question question is, with all of the injuries to the English front line, including Vardy, Rashford, Cain, Defoe and many others, Peter Crouch has been called it of retirement to wear the number nine jersey for England. And with that in mind, name the tallest thing you've ever seen at a sporting event. Do you know why that was probably quite realistic? Jim White? Well, following the fact that they've been unbeaten since the beginning of February, they've got to the final of the Europa League, they got to the final of the FA Cup, dispensing with Manchester City, beating them for the fourth time, I think, this season I'll lose track, in the semi-final. Is there anyone who can touch Oligona Solskia as manager of the season? And I suppose you could make a shout out for Sheffield United for Chris Wilder, but otherwise no. There would be no other managers in consideration for that. Pat Nevin. I would like to actually beat Natalie's acid bitterness here. The first question from Colin Milly certainly, certainly to me, would have been, as I've ever Tony and Pat, how unbelievably fantastic and greater Liverpool FC? Something like that. And is it actually possible to give Yurgan Club a nighthood? And I'd have mumbled something about, yeah, but remember how they tanked after losing the Athletical Madrid and Watford and Chelsea? And then only won the league in gold difference after being having such a big lead that takes something away from it in Colman would have marking down five points as usual as he had done already today and then grudgingly I'd have to admit they're quite good I was thinking about this what would have actually been our question one so I think because Liverpool would have been so it would have been done and dusted so early before knowing this team the first question would have been so, it would have been done and dusted so early before. Knowing this team, the first question would have been who's going to win the title next season. I think that's probably, that might have been where we would have went with it. Right, good points. Biggest landslides in sport. That could have happened. Listen to question. Question two. Comes from Matt Richards. He's already had one before so he knows his theme music already. Unfortunately, it was a Christmas time that he came on. So, yeah, and it was a question about who's the Ebenezer Scrooge of Sport. So that means his tune is Ebenezer Group, playing shaming. Can't change it. I know it's not Christmas, I'm in the middle of a lockdown in May, but that's his theme tune. He asked to stick with it, and here's his question. Hi, Colin. Hi, everybody. With this been an end of Premier League special, question two is this. When else was there a sporting occasion that just went on and on longer than you expected? Matt Nevin. Do you know what, I'm going to give you a little secret here and it's happening far too often and it's the commentator's nightmare. You're in Eastern European game Champions League and you know it's going to go to extra time and penalties. You're in Eastern European Game Champions League and you know it's going to go to extra time and penalties. You know you're not going to get back to the hotel until 3 or 4 a.m. You know the bar's going to be closed as well when you get there. And the BBC have got you a 6 a.m. flight to get back tomorrow and you've got a game the next night. Colin, I know you have been there. You have been that soldier. It's a horrible feeling. This is the honest truth about it. Even though us as commentators and comic commentators trying to make it exciting and sound exciting, if the team at home over in Europe scores a late 90th minute winner against the British team, we try to sound disappointed but we fist bump. That's just the honest truth. Jim Wade, what's just gone on too long in sport? Now I know this was one of the great moments of sport for Pat and Ian and Colin but Natalie I enjoyed it. Last year, England winning the cricket world. Hold on a minute, don't wrap me in this English thing. Free wrong! I might not sound it because I moved to Manchester when I was 10, but I am Scottish. You are on your own gym. The person that only claimed to be Scottish instead of English and sound more English and saying, oh dare you're saying, you got quite posh towards then and I didn't fuck your pick you'll find. I think Natalie verbally proved her Scottish roots there. That was a good suggestion. It was a great moment when England won the World Cup at Lords. It was incredibly exciting and so on. But my word, the competition that preceded it, it went on for decades. And remember, the Cricket World Cup had been reduced to make it more tele-friendly this time. It was the most boring and pointless competition until the final over. Then it was magnificent. Good answer. Ian Sturney. I'm going to take you all to Wimbledon. Famous for the likes of Andy Murray, Serena Williams, Boris Becker et al. But in 2010, I don't know if you remember, on the outer courts, there was a fairly low wattage match between American John Eisner and Nicholas Mau to France, and they achieved legendary status for the longest ever game in Wimbledon history. It went to the fifth set at 47 games apiece, the scoreboard broke because it couldn't work out the score anymore. And after 11 hours, the match was won 6870 in the fifth set. And I can't even remember who won it, and I don't think that's what's important here. What an absolute marathon of a match. I don't think... They sold 3.5 million pounds worth of strawberries during that match alone. I don't think the important thing is me bothering to look up who actually wanted. It doesn't matter, does it? They both had a nice time. They probably got a sponsorship deal from some drinks company. Unlike, I live in the dream. Apart from Ian Sturning's answer to this question, Natalie, what else in sports has gone on too long? Well, this week, we got the excellent news that the Nations League will not be scrapped. Whoopi! Literally, the most confusing tournament in the whole world. I could have spent the full of lockdown trying to understand and read the guidelines and I would have failed because I mean, there's four leagues, two have got 12 teams leagues two have got 12 teams one have got 15 one have got 16 and then they're changing it next time so three have 16 and randomly one has seven it's just so confusing now the first tournament began 21 months ago and although we did get a winner in June of 2019 it's still going on with the playoffs where the teams have a semi-final and then a final and then they get a chance to qualify for the postponed euros. And I know Colin, I can hear you touching, it gives Northern Ireland a chance to qualify and it gives Scotland a chance to qualify as well, which would be some sort of miracle. But it just goes on too long! Well, that's nothing to do with you, is it? You're obviously English. Loads of points off because it shouldn't have went on as long and it's not letting Northern Ireland qualify. It main thing it does, no matter of confusion, it gets rid of friendly. Shame because you were so far in the lead, but now you've been pegged back by all these near-do-wells. And as I have to award the two bonus points, I'm going to give them to Jim White, which gives them a two-point lead as it stands at the moment as we move on the question three. And of course, coronavirus is clearly the worst thing that's happened to any sport. But if you can just forget about that for one second, even though we obviously can't, what is the second worst thing, a distant second worst thing to happen to football this season? Leader, as we are at the moment, Jim White. You're asking a Man United fan what the worst thing about this season is? Bizarre, Colleen. No, actually, I think, you know, apart from the fact that Liverpool are going to win it, the five-day FA Cup third round, it just goes. I mean, this should have been my answer to the previous question, I admit, but it's ridiculous. The joy of the third round is that everybody's in it together and the non-leaks in it with the Giants and the Premier League and they're all in it together. But they're not because one of them's playing on Thursday night, someone else is playing on Monday night. Even on a Saturday they have a stagger kickoff. Let's get it all back together and make it a great, great moment again. Second worst thing in the football season this year in Sturning. It's got to be VAR I've went with. It's just, it's just been, in my opinion, an absolute disaster. It feels like it's not been tested properly. It's come in. None of the referees seem to back it. Goals can no longer be celebrated because you've got this awkward one-minute pause whoever has to decide whether or not is actually a goal or not. No one's really convinced by it anyway. I think that VR decisions are about as convincing as government pandemic slogans. No one's bought into the idea of it in any way whatsoever. You've got goals disallowed. You've got like, they had that David Goldrick's goal against Tottenham disallowed because John Lundstrom's big toe was offside. For Mienu had a goal disallowed because his armpit was offside. Nowadays, goals can be offside depending on whether or not you've had your lockdown haircut or not. It's just not a reliable system. VR's been an absolute disaster. It's taken away some dodgy decisions and it should be taken out of the game in my opinion. Pat Nevin. Do you know what? There's two, sorry, there's three Scots on today, and I have to say for my country. It breaks all sorts of guidelines, by the way, if we hadn't realised nothing. My country football authorities are embarrassing me. They just needed to organise a vote about finishing the leagues early. It's dead easy, but no. The clubs were changing their minds after the deadline, which apparently wasn't a deadline, just as suggesting they of a deadline. Just tell them when he vote. Following this debacle, there has been bullying, lying, rampant self-interest, name-calling, demands for resignations, demands for external inquiries. One club wants to sue other clubs, the league and the FAA, and almost sued itself a mistake. It is mental up here. I'm very upset. There's conspiracy theories up here that would embarrass David Ake. And it's honestly, it's too much. My head's in my hands. We should be doing what England's doing. Actually, sorry, Scotland, we can't do that, can we? Let me just say that during that very good answer, a seismic moment in the history of fighting talk, even at these strange times. People who have been banned from coming on the show just for leaving their kids in reception at the BBC. But in these strange times, for the first time ever, one of our contestants has their child at the moment on her knee. I'm sorry! He looks great. Clearly, I am aware of the rules, Colin, and I would never do this, but these times have left me no option. Exactly. It's really good. Weird that your kids wear in a Liverpool kit. That's the strange part about it. But, you know, which no one needs to see. I won't post out on a picture. Clearly, unequivocally, wearing a Liverpool kit at the moment. We'll try as best as you can, kid on knee. Bear in mind, I have to the rules of rules. You've just lost points. What's the second worst thing about this season? So the second worst thing is that we have to say goodbye to David Silver. Literally one of the greatest players that this country has ever seen and he is leaving at the end of the season. And the idea that I might have seen in play live for the last time is heartbreaking. It makes me nearly cry. Silver has been the lynchpin of City's greatest ever generation. He's the beating heart of the team. He's remained consistent at high level and fit, incredibly, for 10 years. He's played 424 times the city, had 137s assists, won four Premier Leagues, two FA Cups and five league cups. Internationally, he's had 125 caps, won the World Cup, two euros. And this week, Zavi said he is one of the most talented players that Spain has ever produced. And this season is his last in the Premier League. What a player, what a good answer. Let's do the scores. Despite that good answer, the kid walking in scuppered you. You got more points than anyone in that round but of course because of the deductions you're on 12 points. Ian Sterling who reminded us that Wimbledon was famous for Andy Murray is on 13 points as it stands. Pat Nevin on 14 strong Strong start for the Nevin. But in the lead, Jim White, he got the bonus points from Question 2, and that's 15. Very early doors, though. Let's get on with the quickie. We're going to do the sensible thing and that Nutley of Manchester City answer first. What was football's greatest ever last day? I appreciate that because we all know there is only one answer to this. I was lucky enough to be there in person. I only have because we all know there is only one answer to this. I was lucky enough to be there in person. I only have to say four numbers and you all know what I'm talking about. 9320. Manchester City are still alive here. Vallettelli Aguero! I swear you'll never see anything like this again. Watch it and drink it in. Terrible day, terrible comedy. Ian Sterling, tell her the real answer. I believe the real answer happened in the 1994-1995 season. Blackburn were pushing for the title. Yes? It was a great day for Liverpool as well because Blackburn were at Anfield. All Liverpool had to do was allow Blackburn to win and Blackburn could take the title from Manchester United. Liverpool players were showing up in Blackburn shirts. It was all set up to be the perfect day and then in the 90th minute, Jamie Rebknap bangs in a free kick and Liverpool win 2-1. Luckily, United didn't get the result they wanted, meaning that Blackburn won the title at Anfield. Kenny Dalgleish was in charge, which was quite nicely Dalglish picked the title, and Liverpool still got the win. So it was a great day for Liverpool, and it was a terrible day for United and it was fun was had all round Colin Murray's been shaking his head the whole way through that which makes me think I'm in trouble and has put me off slightly I think that Pat Nevin despite wearing blue for way too much of his career might actually save it here and might save you and he may go for the right answer but we'll see Colin I know you love your American sport babe Ruth remember the 86 year old curse for the Boston Red Sox never won a world series then a hundred and eight years for the Chicago Cubs they didn't win there's even more 111 years Island v the All Blacks never won in rugby union nothing absolutely nothing. 114 years that Habername waited to win the Scottish Cup and they beat the mighty Rangers in Glasgow. I was there in that day in 2016 with David Gray scored that head up near post. Ninety-second minute. I've never seen such happiness, such tears, such shock, such joy, forever the greatest final day. Loads of points. You know you're going to get loads of points for that. Still waiting on it though. Jim White's definitely not going to give me it. Off you go. Bizarly, I had a terrible time in 2012 and 95. But anyway, never mind. I've forgotten all about it. No, the greatest day in most significant final day, 26th of May, 1989, when Arsenal won the league at Anfield. The reason being, that was a terrible season, awful season. Hillsborough had happened. Football was at its very, very lowest ebb. We'd had the Heysville Stadium disaster. We'd had the Bradford fire. Football was a pariah sport. Everybody hated it. Everybody thought it should end. What that match did was remind everybody what a fantastic product it is. It's the most compelling, the most dramatic sport on television. And a lot of television executives were watching that match and thought hang on this is proper content we've got here and that was what was the seed that was planted in their minds that then became the Premier League and became what we are now brilliant answer but disappointed and in red my face correctly he didn't go king kenny's first season as player manager of liverpool and that goal at Stamford Bridge especially because Pat you were playing in it. I was playing. I certainly was. We were the better team but of course Kenny needed to get the winner. That was the only way it could end. Is that actually on the club crest of Chelsea? Is it? Actually we were the better team. It is the most horrible thing people winning anything at your ground. It's not personal, it's not against them. You just don't want anyone celebrating there. So we slunk off very quickly that day. Listen, I won't have a Chelsea fan tell me anything about that. You've had much longer for that wound to heal than me watching Chelsea stop Liverpool win the league at Anfield. Right, let's move on swiftly. I don't know about you, but there's nothing more depressing than every newspaper and every website, including the BBC, should take down the fact that when we, on the day that matches are still meant to happen, they put postponed up still, and you get to see all the fixtures. So a lot of people today be having a look at those final games and going, where would I have been? So, have a look through them and tell me, if you could have just watched one, what where would I have been? So, have a look through them and tell me, if you could have just watched one, what one would you have watched, and how would it have panned out? Ian Sterling. Well, I had a little look down, and I saw Man City versus Norwich. Now, one of my favourite things in the Premiership is when one of the bottom teams goes on a mad runner form towards the end of the season to try and crawl their way out of the bottom teams goes on a mad run of form towards the end of the season to try and crawl their way out of the bottom three. I think Norwich started the season quite well. Timu Pookie, everyone thought he was going to be like the next Ian Wright for about three matches. He could have come back into form. City, well, they've been dead in the water since January. So by this point, they've got literally nothing to play for. So you could have seen Norwich actually really turned city over at their own ground. It would have been a pleasure to watch. It would have been a lovely bit of salt in those. We've won the league wounds. And I think it would have been a fantastic match. 4-0. Timu Kooky hat trick. He would have signed for Chelsea for 50 million quid and been on the bench for the next two seasons. Ian Sterling is watching Man City against Norwich. What's Natalie watching? I would also be watching Man City versus Norwich for a totally different reason. And that's my son just told me to stop talking. So that's brilliant. Have some more chocolate, child. Burringdon 101 there. Brought you this Saturday morning in the BBC. Have some more chocolate child. Burrington 101 there. Brought you this Saturday morning in the BBC. Have some chocolate child. I can't quite remember your name right now, but have some chocolate child number three. It would have been a nothing game. Where's the nanny? Nanny! Nanny! So it would have been a nothing game, but I would have been watching it. We'd already finished second. They'd already down. But I would be watching because, following on from my previous answer, in the following weeks, we would have an FA Cup final and a Champions League final coming up. So I would be watching it hoping that nobody got injured. Or indeed, watching our under 21s play because all the big names are being rested for the big final. I'd be watching Taylor Howard Bellis. I'd be watching Tommy Doyle, local born, young city, born and bred players. We'd win, then we'd all go home. We'd have a cup of tea and an early night to get ready for our trips to Wembley and Istanbul. And that backs up Ian's answer that that would have fallen perfectly into the hands of a Batley Norwich. Child, eat the chocolate! So I'm just helping her out just quick, just because of a kid can hear, and I just want to just help you out there, Natalie. Goodness me. Jim White, what are you watching last day of the season? Well, as I'm on the panel with three Scots people, Timo Pooke, can I just point out he's finished? He's no finish! Anyway, I would have been at Leicester against Manchester United, the race for third. And, you know, Brendan Rogers' last chance to get in. Oh, no, no, he's still getting, Chelsea would be out of it. Yeah, no, I think it would have been a really interesting game and I think United has continued their surge of undefeatedness. That might have been the one Jim that had a lot riding on it last day of the season. It would have been fantastic. Pat. June O'Connell, I'm going for Pallas versus Spurs and the reason for it is I like a bit of comedy with my football. Spurs needed to win this game, I'm sure, to get European football, but once again the fall of the final happen. It always happens to them. They trip themselves up every time. Remember when they had a chance to win the league when Lester won it and they blew at at Stanford Bridge? Remember they get to the Champions League final playing proudly? Then they didn't turn up against Liverpool. Spurs are the only team ever to have lost the last eight FAA Cup simil finals on the spin. That's absolutely incredible that. Spurs are the Scotland of the Premier League. Always finding new ways to blow it. Josie, by the way, he was spontaneously combust when it happened. That's a game I'd like to be it. When the world gets you down, music can help you through. In 2017, my life took a bit of a bad turn. The way I coped is by listening to as many records from the previous year as I could. I'm James Acaster and I believe that 2016 is the greatest year for music ever. I've been listening to it backwards. Backwards. I've been listening to it backwards. So on my podcast, me and my comedian friends will discuss my favourite albums of that year. In order to convince every single one of you, too. That's a classic album right there. James Acaster's Perfect Sounds. Listen now on BBC Sounds. All right, I'll move on, not do the scores yet. Proper fighting talk on the way. If the season had gone as planned, who would you want to see relegated today and who would you want to be celebrating coming up from the championship to replace them? So if all things had to stay normal in all of our lives, who would you wave goodbye to and really welcomed up to the top tier of English football? Jim White. Well, I'm only saying this because Martin Kellner's not on the panel, but come on, we'd all like to see West Ham go down, wouldn't we? Not because we're against West Ham as a club or against them, their fans or anything, but because of their owners, wouldn't it be magnificent to see that threesome down in the championship? It would be the moment of giant hubris to see them relegated. I'd really enjoy it. And as for coming up, well, you can't look beyond Leeds. Proper team back in the Premier League. Enjoy the battles ahead. Be great. Would you rather have them back up for that, just for those two games, to have them back again? Because they are, they, there's proper hatred. Oh, no, it would be, it would be great. It would, you know, basically when we've left Liverpool miles behind in the Premier League next season, obviously that won't be as important a game. So, yeah, you've got to have something to look forward to. I just love the fact you're in that next season purgatory that I was in for so long, for so many dark years of my adult too, the next season things. Just to, and the only people can see it is people in the outside. Natly. So before I explain, my answer is Villa, but I need to say sorry to my friends Jack and Liam who support Villa. But I've always had a soft spot for Villa because of them but it all changed this year at the final of the League Cup and I was doing a spot on the pitch before the game a bit of build-up for the city fans and I did an interview with Sean Wright Phillips and before I'd even started talking they introduced me they said my name and oh my God the booze from the Villa fans were deafening as far as I know I've not done anything to upset the villa fans so that is my reason they can now boo me they've got a real reason to boo me now except they're never going to get a chance because they're going down and who do you want to see come up oh I want to see leads coming up because the more teams in the Premier League that hate United, the better. Good answer. Ian Sterling. Well, I think like everyone, you've got to see Leeds come up. I'm a child of the 90s and actually not seeing Leeds in the top tier still doesn't feel right. Because as a kid of the 90s, I just remember the Leeds being incredible. They were quite good at football with like Australians in their team, which is still impressive to me to this day. I just like the way they play, get them up. And I'd like to see them replace Bormiff, who are the most boring football team in the world. They've got the most middle class boring fans in the world. Their stadium is tiny, it's bland, it's like one sixth of the Emirates without any of the world. Their stadium is tiny, it's bland, it's like one sixth of the Emirates without any of the corporate money. Bormouth are just boring. They're actually scored the least amount of goals this season in the Premiership. Which isn't true, they're 16th, but the fact you believed me shows you how boring Bormouth are. Boring, Bormith, please go down. You know what, you'd almost be in the lead. If you hadn't said premiership twice already instead of... I did I do it again? Yeah, I've done it twice. I do it every time on this show. Oh dear. You know, it's interesting so many people want to see leads come up and be else's the thing that we haven't mentioned yet. Maybe Pat will. Who you want to see come up and who do you want to see? Go down. Pat, never. Sorry, sorry, Pat, if you can just wait one second. He's the bounty! The blue one! The blue one! Sorry, Pat, off you go. I love it. You've got to give Natalie more points, doing it under this pressure. I think, I know one thing about Natalie, your son is actually a Bella fan, just so you know that. Just now, he's giving you so much abuse then. Right, I want Bournemouth to go down. Look, I love them. They're sweet. They're actually very, very friendly. But have you ever tried to get there? It's the hardest place. You can play a game in Benbecular and it would be easier to get there than Bournemouth. I include for Londoners there. Look, it's not the end of the world down there, but you can certainly see it from there. And now that Flybee has gone barely up, it's no possible to get there from anywhere else in the UK. But then again, by next Thursday, all the airlines will have gone. So I don't think that makes much a change. Having said that, Norwich, it's not actually much better, is it? I mean, it's handy that you get to the Netherlands than it is to get to Norfolk. It's not a bit 20 miles further on as well. So, now, I'll stay with Bournemouth. Team going up, I want Brentford. Great with new little stadium. I went to see them a cup game earlier. They play brilliant, brilliant football. And most importantly, it will annoy all the snobs in the Premier League. Get them up. Yeah, it would probably be through the playoffs. Every week I drive every Saturday on the way to do the highlights, to drive past that new stadium so I've watched it get built bit by bit and it'll be good for them. It's a bit like Luton when they leave Kenilworth Road for their new stadium, I think season after next, but there's a sad bit of that as well because they may not be fit for purpose of the modern game, but places like Kenilworth Road and Griffin Park, Pat, brilliant. I would add one thing about Brentford it is the only place I ever played a game of football and demanded to be taken off by the manager at halftime because I wanted to go and see a new order gig. It's not blood on the tracks though, Pat. It's fighting talks, you're not getting any points for that. It would have been great on Blood and the Tracks though. You would have won the round without a shadow without doubt. Right, if the season had have ended today, who would have been getting the player of the year and who would have been the young player of the year in Sterling? Player of the year, I think, again, I've got a feeling this might be a bit of a Leeds answer and a bit unanimous, but Virgil Van Dyke is just, he's just an incredible player, undoubtedly the best player in his position, possibly the best player in the world at the minute. You don't even need stats, you just need to watch him. He just appears at the thin air and just heads things away. He always looks cool, calm and collected. Everybody, when you say you're a level fan, says they want Virgil and their team. It's got to be Virgilvan Dick, player the year. And for Young Player of the Year, it's got to be Virgilvan deck for the year and for Young Player of the Year it's got to be Billy Gilmore because as a Scottish person every year I watch English people get excited about a young English talent who's not proven yet on a big stage whether it's Wilshire, Walcott, whoever used to get big up and I think it's saying that Scotland can get excited about a man that's been good twice but what a twice. Billy Gilmore is the only player I've seen outplay the Liverpool midfield this year. He looks incredible. That's Scotland midfield now with McTominy Gilmore McGinn. We could get into major tournaments once again we could be like leads rising from the ashes. Billy Gilmore's the next Pat Nevin and that's why he is my young player of the year. If he's listening now, he's just sunk in, his seat at that. Well done for talking about Virgil Van Dyck and that's saying he's a Rolls Royce of a player, which is the ultimate Virgil Van Dyck cliche. It's almost like you have to compare him to Rolls Royce every time you mention him. Jim White, who's getting your player of the year? Who's getting your young player? Well, I think it's really important that David Silver, it's acknowledged that he has now achieved one fewer Premier League titles than John O'Shea. So, you know, obviously he's in everybody's mind. But I actually think it is Virgil Van Dyck. I think it's Jordan Henderson. I think that when Liverpool had that wobble, Henderson wasn't there. He really does knit everything together. He's been absolutely a driving engine behind Liverpool's title success. I can't believe maybe the first of 30 years. But anyway, fantastic performance. And Henderson was really, really critical to it. And I know he doesn't seem like a young player, but I think he still falls into the category, partly because he's been so good for so long. Alexander Arnold, the Liverpool fullback, who is so good at passing the football, he should be playing in midfield. I probably would play in midfield by any other club, actually. Brilliant answer. Pat Nevin, player of the year, young player of the year. You can't look beyond Van Dyke. He's been absolutely astonishing. Rolls from a player, him, Pat. I'm not going there. I'm not going there. Do you know what? How good will he be when he actually starts trying? Because it doesn't even look as if he's trying yet. He's absolutely incredible. So, Van Dyke, absolutely brilliant. Stick on. I love the idea of young player, giving it to Billy Gilmore, but two games isn't enough. And by the way, he brilliant. Stick on. I love the idea of young player giving it to Billy Gilmore, but two games isn't enough and by the way he's a lovely kid on top of the old. This is great. Obviously a lot of the young Chelsea kids have done well. Rees James, watch out for him. Really, really special. One of the biggest names of decade going forward. But I am going Villa. Surprise, surprise. John again had a great season. It would have been him. But Jack Grealish, now he might be on the edge of whether he can get young player or not but you got to watch him he is fantastic you always have to keep your eye you never know what he's going to do particularly during long time do you qualify for a young player yeah he does Rahim Sterling won it last year at 25 and Grealish is 24 oh wow excellent loads of points for playing and made a top of the year and the young player of the year so we pretty much know that and Grealish is 24. Oh wow. Excellent. Loads of points for plan. And made it topical. Natalie, player of the year and the young player of the year. So we pretty much know that Virgil Van Dyck would have won it. He also would have won the young player of the year even though he's 28 because they just would have worked it out somehow. And the fact that Henderson has even being mentioned is embarrassing because because the man he's going to win it is Kevin DeBreiner because Kevin de Breiner plays at a level that Jordan Henderson has never reached and never will reach. So let's just put that out there. So Kevin DeBroner is a man who makes football look effortless. He is a prodigy. He makes it look easy. Every time he plays is a masterclass and he makes the impossible seem possible. He's not just the best midfielder in the Premier League, but probably the world. I mean, there's so many stats. I think stats are boring, but just to tell you that in this season, he had 17 assists when the season ended. That's my son, breaking things in the kitchen. He's also beaten Henri's record this season for the most assists. He's on a different planet. So Kevin de Broiner, any other answer is embarrassing. For Young Player of the Year, I like Jack Greenish, I was going to go for Jack Greenish because on a talk show that I do on BBC Radio Manchester, I made a comment that Jack Grilish was too good for United and it absolutely and utterly wound them up and the phones went wild. So you can imagine that. But I'm actually going to go for Tammy Abrahams because I love the fact that he took his chance. I mean, let's face, if they hadn't, Chelsea hadn't have got that transfer bad, he wouldn't have got a chance. But he got the chance and he took it. Let me do the scores at this stage in fight talk. By our mind, usually you lose three points every time your kid interferes with fining talk. Well, I've done that later. Well, no, just to mind us. Well, no, just to keep the tradition up, I've taken the initial three points off, but saying as we're in extreme circumstances, I haven't taken points off after that. Thank you. Just burn, come on. The Yorkie! Thank you. I've never been on, Colin, and not lost significant points. Nobody's ever been in fighting talk not lost significant points. 55 times, Jim White's been on. And 55 times he's lost significant points but not today as you're about to find out. Scores. Well Natalie still went in touch and distance. He's reached a big 3-0 there on 30 and just one point behind in Sterling who's on 31 so that's the Man City Liverpool battle going on at the moment. Pat Nevin's on 32 but remember he's on his first Patrick as a fighting talker of many years of over a decade and Jim White is on 34. Okay then so a vague and controversial shift in messaging from the government this week as stay home became stay alert so which footballer is the most alert Pat Nevin. Very tempted to go for Moise Akeen or Kyle Walker because you know, but they weren't actually that alert. The players who were alert were the spurs players who didn't get caught. Not when the lockdown and other players were running about and Marigni told them to do it. The ones that didn't get caught, they were the alert ones. Okay, Jim, on you go. I always love watching Jamie Vardy when he plays, because for a lot of the time, he looks as though he's not involved, and then suddenly, the moment there's an opportunity, he runs for it at great pace. He runs along the back line. He's always alert, and he, you know, he looks like, he looks kind of a fox, doesn't he looks like an alert kind of guy. And the way he plays. And the fact that when Lester won the title, it was him who had the party. He is alert. He is alert. Natalie Pavlick, kid now, chocolate it up and in the back garden, running about crazy. Perfect parenting. Perfect parenting lessons. So when I first read this question, garden running about crazy perfect parenting perfect parenting parenting so when I first read this question the most awful dad joke in the world came into my head and I have to apologize for saying this on national radio it was vigilant van diek I'm sorry I'm sorry it's awful it's awful so I've got a real answer my real answer is Vincent Company obviously the former city captain and club legend now you might not know but while he was at City, Company graduated with a Masters in Business Administration, and he said, you start talking to lawyers and accountants, and the more advanced you get, the less you understand. In the end, I decided I'm going to put myself through studies and find out what they're talking about. Now, that's alert, because nobody is screwing over vincent company absolutely not ayn sterling who's the most alert in football well i think after all the sugar natalie sun's probably the most alert person on this planet um but i'm not going to give you one play i'm going to give you several we've got huang he chan slatko juverich andreas ulmer pats and daka i could go on they're the most alert because they play for FC Salisburg, or to give them the full name, FC Red Bull Salisburg, who played the Red Bull Stadium. They've got Red Bull on the badge. They've got so much sponsorship from Red Bull. They must have cans of it kicking about. So those guys will be alert 24 hours a day, seven days a week. So it's the FC Red Bull Salzburg players for me. Very good. Right, with Project Restarts still some way away, memories of life football in the UK are getting dimmer and dimmer. So back to simpler times, what was your game of the 2019-20 season? Up until it obviously went on pause or ended, whatever it turns out to be. So were we used well at non-social distancing when you watched it? So it is the first leg of the semi-final of the League Cup when we played United at Old Trafford and I'm sure James remembers it very, very well. Not so much my game of the season, but more my 45 minutes of the season. A half in which we scored four goals and played the most sublime football. A half that was so good that I feel like they literally need to send the tape out to every academy in the country and say, this is how you play football. It was also a half of football that I completely and totally missed because I don't get to very many evening away games anymore because I do not have any childcare as you know anyway quarantine has not changed that and my lovely son was having a bad time he did not want to go to bed he was having a meltdown so I had to deal with the screaming and the crying and calm him while I put into bed now I kid you not I came down the stairs at half time coming to my living room I said to my husband what's the score he said-0. I thought he was actually properly winding me up. And yes, you will have gathered from that as well. Though my husband was in the house, he was sat downstairs watching the game. He did not come upstairs once to help with the child. So I had to watch the best 45 minutes of football. This country has seen this season, and I had to watch it the next day. Okay, not the best 45 minutes of football as country has seen, season and I have to watch it the next day. Okay, not the best 45 minutes of football as seen, but certainly that you could have seen your team play. Is your husband a city fan as well? Yes, we met we met at city. Okay, good. So that's fair enough, you sort of, you know, you've villainised him there, but what about the second leg? Who put the kid to bed? Well, I was working, so it's fine. Unlucky. Yeah. Right. Pat Nevin. Do you know what? It's a weird game. Lester hosted Chelsea. It was a two-to-drawera, but it was brilliant. First turn up at the stadium, I love Lester. They're so friendly. But I think Brendan Rogers and Frank Lampeter, they'd had a meeting beforehand decided tactics are not allowed today, other than school playground tactics and it was brilliant it was we attack you you attack us nobody's going to leave enough defenders back no one's going to stick to their positions goal hanging is obligatory it was absolutely brilliant now I love like Natalie my tactical masterclasses with Man City they are great but now and again you want a rip roaring devilaring double-me-care. Couldn't give a stuff, I'll go for. English game, and this was one of them. They're getting rid of those games. That was a cracker. Yeah, good game. Jim White, game of the season? Yeah, well done, Natalie. One winning four. Fantastic. Lose Diels a three, but never mind. No, the best game I saw this season was a proper F8 Cup tie. It was the fourth round replay between Outson United in Newcastle. Newcastle went into a 2-0 lead with about five minutes to go. Oxford came back, equalised, went into extra time, Oxford were all over them. And it looked as though there was going to be a giant killing. And then this incredible goal by Alan San Maxime, the name of the season as well, scored a brilliant solo goal for Newcastle. It was everything the FAA touch should be. It was end to end. It was incredibly compelling, really, really exciting. And I was standing in the slams of one must be cheering away. Yeah, what a game that was. In starting game of the season? This was the weekend where dreams began to happen. I was in the pub watching a few games. And then we started as a few my Liverpool friends to take notice of Norwich versus Manchester City at the start of the season. Norwich had so many injuries. They had to field two goalkeepers on their bench. I think they had eight or nine players out. You were thinking it was another run of the mill. Normal victory for Man City. And out of nowhere, Norwich score three. They managed to hold on to a three to win despite City having 27 attempts on goal. Liverpool went 15 points clear at the top of the league and we started to think this might happen. The only thing that can stop us now is a global pandemic, but that is absolutely ridiculous. Ian is obsessed with Man City versus Norwich. I know. I know. He's thought it. Yeah, exactly. Whether it's happened or not, he looks at either way, he's loving it, no matter where it was in the season. Another thing that today would have been, not just the end of the football season this weekend, it would have also been a Whirl Whiskey Day. So, this is classic old school fighting talk. There's any question like this, Jim White, your first ever appearance in fighting talk, something like this. So let me have your suggestion for footballers is whiskey, scotch or bourbon. I'll take rye as well. You know what I mean? Our whiskey or their whiskey. I'll take all of them. Right, Ian Sturling, you can start me off. Well, I'm not, basically, I'm sort of, whiskey is the drink, I'm not, Scotch is basically what Americans call it because they take everything far too literally. And bourbon, unless you're putting coconut, is a disgrace of a drink. It's just sweetened, it's for plastics. So if I had to describe any player as any drink, it would be bourbon and it would describe Paul Pogba because it's overrated, it's got a fancy bottle but not any of that good quality content. It's just sweeting for people that think they like the real thing, but they can't stomach the real thing, and it has no place in the whiskey fraternity. So that's why my bourbon is Paul Pogba. Jim White. Yeah, I think Graham Sooners has got a whole seller as that, hasn't he? I don't know if you remember a couple of years ago. David Beckham was on the TV advertising Hague Club. It was a new blend of whiskey, and it was a new classic blend. And it's apparently been a bestseller ever since. It's been right up there. It's entered the lexicon of whiskey. Everybody's talking about it. And I think Bruno Fernandez as Hayd Club, he came from nowhere and looked as though he'd always been there. And it's a brilliant, smooth, elegant blend of whiskey, Bruno Fernandez. It says everything about this show that it seems like you've all put more research into footballers as whiskey than you have to any other question in the show. I mean, Hague Club is a single mall. I would just like to make that very clear. Yeah, experts all over this. Right, Natalie, let's have it. Yeah, I seem to have taken this question slightly differently, but hopefully that's okay. So my dad's favourite whiskey is called Old Pulteney, And that is a really safe Christmas gift every year for my dad. So I just kind of played with the name a bit. So I'm going for Old Rooney. And it is a well-matured whiskey, so we know it'll go down very well with Old Wayne. Okay, that's okay. I don't know how close the name was, but where you were going, but that's fine. Pat Nevin. Be it any food in the world or indeed any drink, Borora whiskey is the most beautiful thing I have ever tasted in my entire life. By miles. I had feelings about tasting that that you're not supposed to have about food. It's heaven in a glass. So, David Silva may well be also the most beautifully balanced, tasteful, nuanced, smooth, complex, delicious player ever to have played the game in England. And I'm changing the name to David Brora Silver. By the way, Colin, never forget what true Scotsman says about whiskey and water, do you know? No. Never have a whiskey without adding a little water. And the reverse is true. Right, good answers. All right, there is at the moment, as it stands at the moment, Chelsea and Manchester United would make it to defend the indefensible. And Manchester City and Liverpool would be left to ask questions of themselves. Only one question in any other business left to change that. And we finish with the three letter round, because pre-COVID-19, of course, if the 2019-20 season would have been remembered for anything, it would have been VAR. It was every week, wasn't it? It was top of the agenda. Mine numbingly so at time. So what other acronyms would be able to bring back memories of August 2019 to March 2020. Acronoms, nothing sexier. Jim White. This is the one we're going to be talking about in the future, and it's SBN, Saudis by Newcastle, because I think that is going to change the complexion of the Premier League. These guys are not coming in just for a bit of a laugh. They're coming in to put their name on the Premier League. These guys are not coming in just for a bit of a laugh. They're coming in to put their name on the map internationally. They are going to put money into Newcastle. They're going to ensure that Newcastle are a top four side, probably going into Europe and so on. And don't forget, the Saudis, they do like an acronym because they even call their leader, Mohammed bin Salman, MBS, don't they? So FBN, Saudi by Newcastle. Good answer. Natalie, give me your season acronym. So I was going to go BBD, which would be bye-bye David, but I've already had him in an answer. And I'm also wanted to be a bit more positive. So I'm going to go ASP. And that is Arise, Sir Phil. For this has been the season that the young man from Stockport has stepped up and proved that he is the natural successor to take the throne from King David. And Pat. Do you know what? I think nothing will be remembered from this season at all except COVID-19 in the shutdown. So if anyone asked me anything in the future about what happened this season, I will say the letters N-F-I. The first, no, the last idea. The middle F, footballing. Ian Sterling. Well, I'm a lovable fan and an optimist. So the only acronym I'm using at the minute is TBD to be decided. Because we will work out a way to decide who takes the title, who stays up, who goes down. It's all still to play for. And there will be an open top bus going around the very quiet streets of Amfield with Virgil Van Dyke and a hazmat suit. That will still take place at some point this year. That's the vision. Any other business and it looks at the moment it's going to be massive upsets unless something hugely changes here. Right, what's in your mind? Natalie Pavlik. So what's on my mind is I hate PowerPoints. I hate PowerPoints. I've hated PowerPoints my whole life. As long as I can remember PowerPoints existed. I hated PowerPoints when I was in university. If there was a lecture and a PowerPoint came off, I switched off. That was it. Gone to another planet. Now in work, if there's like a big meeting, it's dead serious, I've got to pay attention. A PowerPoint comes up and gone. And now, in one of the worst crises we've ever had, we're getting our daily news via PowerPoint. And I hate it. And I want to pay attention so badly because it's so important. And I want to watch the Prime Minister address the country and tell us the most important information of our generation. And then a PowerPoint pops up and I hate it. I hate PowerPoint. No one's ever went PowerPoint, yay. There's never been a good reason. Never! Yeah, Pat Nevin, any on the business? Look, I like my country and there's three of us on today. However, there's a problem. Nicholas Surgeon has gone to the lockdown a bit longer than the rest of the country, but I'm missing my golf. I live in the Scottish borders, only a couple of miles into Scotland and I'm not allowed to get the golf clubs out. That's fine. The biggest problem is the Hercil, my golf club and coal stream is 400 yards away from the English border. It's torture! It's a nightmare for me! That's only two decent drives, Nicola. You're still not let me play. It's got to be a bit of leeway in the fairways. I've never had so much free time. The weather's beautiful and that golf goes is more tempting than a 40-year-old broor whiskey. Nicola, I understand, but this is a tough one. Can you, but legally though, you're allowed now to make that journey that extra distance, so why don't you just go to the most northern English English golf club? And you'd be allowed to play golf there? Surely you... No, we're not allowed to travel. We are still on the lockdown of only essential travel. Right. But surely once you cross, could you not just get your eggs and your eggs and bread and milk in England? Yeah. That'll be your loophole. That'll get you in England and then you can change. To be honest, Colin it's 6 a.m. this morning when I was in the seventh green I thought exactly that. If the police stop you if the police stop you pat you can just say your golf bags your bag for life. No I come for Glasgow my golf bag. Hey that's my security mate seven eyes my security. It's the same if you're if you're working out you sort of near the southern Ireland Northern Ireland, then you've got two different as well. Neil Delamere works in both so he's just literally waiting to see which one eases first so he can get back to work. So yeah, there is the border people. Definitely think about that. There's some houses, there's a street where half the houses are in Wales and half the houses are in England. And because the rule changes this week that you can view houses in England, that markets open back up half of that streets. They can sell their houses and the other half can't. So, yeah, the border is quite all the anomalies that exist because of it. Right, Ian, what's your any other business? Right, I feel like I've dropped the ball this fighting talk and I do apologise, but it's for good reason because this week I think I've invented a phrase that is going to sweep the lockdown nation. We are staying in the house all the time. The house is just constantly dirty. The dishwasher is always filled. There's always boxes from Amazon. You can't make the house look nice, which is now everyone has their house zoom tidy. Zoom tidy is where your house is a stay apart from the surrounding just where you can be seen on your Zoom call camera. To my left and to my right, there's pants, there's plates with curry from last night, but this area of my house right here is so zoom tidy. And I think everyone's got a room in their house and a little area that is zoom tidy and I think that will become the next, the next yolo. I'm just into it, Zoom tidy. Jim White, what's your other business? No, he's right, Ian. You know, when you see the House of Parliament in the days when they used to have MPs there, they'd all crowd around whoever was speaking, wouldn't they? I think they called it doughnutting. That's funny. It's their equivalent of Zoom Tidy. Yeah. Absolutely right. But Zoom, it's completely changed our lives. You know, I didn't know it existed. I don't suppose anyone knew it existed. Now we spend half our lives on Zoom. A load of really, really good, interesting comedies have come through on Zoom. None better than Andrew Cotter, the BBC golf correspondent, who's been cheering the nation up, frankly, with his videos about him and his dogs. Absolutely brilliant, hilarious. And the one with Zoom, if you haven't seen it, it will cheat. It is so funny. He takes the Mickey out of Zoom meetings by conducting one with these two dogs. One of the funniest and most interesting things I've seen for a long time. So thank you very much, Andrew Cotter. Excellent. Right, let's have a look at the final scores on this finding talk. End of season as well. Colin, can I remind you that I'm wearing my colours today, just in case you forgot, I've got my city jacket on. Yeah, you're the only one. You're the only one that wore their colours. And, you know, it's... Thank you. If there was one thing about this show that everyone's thinking listeners, wasn't enough manseidy answers, weren't they? You know, on top of Natalie's, I got everybody... The only Jim, bless them, didn't give me a man's city answer. I don't think so, the whole show. I don't think so the whole show. Well done. Let's get the final scores. Well, despite notching up half a century eight, there's nothing that the two big guns could do. Locked in 50 points eight, Man City and Liverpool will not be in defending, indefensible. Natly and Ayn. Which means Jim White is on for his hat-trick on 54, but a very strong last 15 means Pat Nevin goes in slightly, the lead, not that it means much, on 55. Yeah, it's time for defend, Ian defensible 20 seconds to defend a statement that I make, no matter how tough it is, no matter how abhorable and objectional, that statement would be to you. It's a shame ain't starting, not in the final, but in protest he has put a virtual background up on a Zoom, which is the picture of Pat and Evan from the enemy in the Beret, which is sensational stuff. But, Pat, you've the most points in regular time, so you get to go first 20 seconds to defend the indefensible. Here's what it is. Pat, you ready? I'm ready. Chelsea need to use this break to do this sensible thing, get rid of Frank Lampard. They need to get rid of Frank Lampard because he's the man that's not been doing it. It's been Jodie Morris. It's been doing it. You can tell because it's the little ones. It's the kids. It's the young guys that have been doing it and all the kids are on my side. Even Natalie's son's on my side as well. But yeah, let J get there, get Frank out there, he's just a big time challenge nothing more than me from time. That's fantastic, Pat. I think you definitely got Natalie's kids approval there during that. So that's never up before. That might help you out. Let's find out. That's what you've got to beat Jim White, who's on a hat trick for the first ever time. Is it going to be three wins in a row for White Lines? Let's find out. It's given that it's the end of season, and given you're all in representing your teams, you know where this is going to go, or roughly where it's going to go. Jim, 20 seconds to defend this in defensiveal. Manchester United should be exempt from Project Restart as they simply have nothing to play for. Well, absolutely, Colin. We are looking to the future. There is no point thinking about this season. This season is over, despite the surge, despite the brilliance, despite Bruno Fernandez taking Mantisper City apart. No, we're looking to the future. We're taking a feather out of Liverpool's cap. And it's going to be... There was that moment in the middle where your soul was dying Jim and you had to make that reference to the city game. You had to make that reference to the city game. It made it slight, you know, it was like, do you to use a reference that we probably shouldn't make on Family Radio yet? It was kind of like it wasn't an uncut. It wasn't an uncut. I feel like you watered it down. That little bit in the middle you added. So therefore, for that reason, it's with a heavy heart. I think I'll have to just lean to one. And maybe if you want to blame anyone, Jim, blame Natalie's child, right? And all that chocolate for laughing at Pat. Pat Nevin gets the win on today's fighting talk. Thank you very much all four of you for giving up your mornings for us and being part of today. I really, really appreciate it. Thank you to all four of you. Mind how you go. Thank you. See you soon. Thank you. Thank you so much, Colin. Take care everyone. And thank you so much to you for sticking with Fighting Talk in these unusual circumstances. We're staying at 11 o'clock all the way to the end of the season. We're very stubborn that way. We're even doing an FA Cup special next weekend. Then, of course, champions of champions to finish the season. And we'll see you for Fighting Talk next week. Fighting Talk is a World's End production for BBC Radio 5 Live."}
