And I quote, Fighting Talk is the greatest show on earth, by far the longest running and best competitive sports radio entertainment vehicle on a weekend morning. I wish there were more programs like it. Moreover, I cannot think of a single BBC show that wouldn't be improved by the addition of annoying points deduction sound effects, including the 6 o'clock news. So, there you have it. Warm but accurate words from our esteemed leader. Let's see who is up for some agro this morning. First up, very much bucking the trend of comics who have recently come on fighting talk for cheap plugs for upcoming gigs. This man has just finished his latest tour, Neil by mouth. Breaking news. Dates just announced for Achilles Neal. The next UK and Irish tour begins November the 1st. Our first guest, Neil Delamere is Neil Delamere. Hello, Neil Delamere. Hello, I mean, I love a pun title for my tour shows like Fresh Prince of Delamere and Crem Delamere. But in light of last night's Greek heroics, I do feel like Achilles Neal is somewhat provocative. It feels like a dig. It does feel like a dig. But I would like to start the show on behalf of all Irish people saying, d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d... If you think he's not moving his head and clicking his little fingers, you're wrong. Just to clear something up, the last time we spoke, not on this show, I was preparing myself for a colonoscopy. Yeah. Good news is no major problems around the back for me. Excellent. So, yeah, your minds can be at ease. I was thinking about it since we spoke. Yeah, constantly, I imagine. Waking up in the middle of the night, just worrying about. But how is that guy's bow? Yeah. Also, I'm sort of building up something I think here. What is your foot size? I'm just going to note it down. A's nine. What do you mean? You know what your foot size is. No, it depends on whether you're wearing football boots. Yeah, it depends what way. Oh, because you really want to feel the ball. Yeah. I don't think you're quite at that level, Neil. When you're my level of talent, I mean, like, it's intuitive. Just tell you, are you an eight or a nine? You're buying normal, okay. I would say eight. So where did nine come from then? Football boots. What, you're buying baggy football boots? No, she's right. Thank you. You buy small in football boots. No, you don't. You've got those up. You've wearing a little size up. Oh, thank you. Absolutely. Absolutely. I'm not interested in climbing shoes. Fix up. You've got a small in football boots. No, you don't. You've got to size up. Thank you. You're wearing a little size up. Absolutely. I'm not interested in climbing shoes. Fixer. The thing is that you, no, you go down in shoe size for football. Are we talking vibran five fingers? What are we talking about here? You're still trying to get growing room in your shoes. You're not playing football in your suit socks. Silk. Exactly. This is absolutely, I can't. You regret and asking the question. Yeah, I am. I absolutely, I can't. You regretting asking the question. Yeah, I am. I am. I wasn't expecting this. But you are an eight unless you're buying a 10 for your football boots. You're absolutely madman. Yeah. Next up, a broadcaster is known on all his social media platforms as Flex United. Got to be tempted to quietly drop the United part. Depends you're not talking about it. We know which one you're talking about. His bio says he once played basketball for the London Lions. A fact we cannot verify, as no one knows his real name. Flex is here. Hello, Flex. Hi, I'm good. The reason why you can't verify that is because they wasn't called London Lions at the time, so it's a technicality. Oh, okay. They were called MK Lines. And did you play for him? Yeah. It's a bit like MK Dons and Wimbledon. It changed. Okay. What position were you? Shooting guard. All. It's a bit like M.K. Don's in Wimbledon. It changed. Okay. What position were you? Shooting guard. All right. This all sounds quite plausible. And shoe size, please. 10 and a half, but it depends. Sometimes I get a 10. For football. No, why would you go 10? Yeah, for football. So he can feel the ball. I don't want to say this again. If I could get technical, if it's a Jordan 1 low, it's a 10 all day. If it's an air max, it's 10 and a half. Hang on, hang on. Jordan 1 low, 10. Yeah. all day. If it's an air max, it's 10 and a half. Hang on, hang on. Jordan one low, 10. Yeah. It's good to get the stats, isn't it? Airmax 10 and a half. Adidas's got to be 11. Basketball straight 11. And that's enough now. Next up, a journalist and presenter is read by millions of commuters who pick up the discarded metro newspaper from the seat opposite them on public transport. No one has ever read a single word of this woman's work while stationary or above ground. As we will always point out when she's on the show, terrible former fighting talk intern. Kate Mason! Hello, Kate. Sounds like you think most of my readers are dead. Oh yeah, I was thinking on a sort of subway, but I wouldn't be surprised if a few of your reads need to be exhumed. What's your shoe size? My feet are size four. Size, but that is actually very small, isn't it? Finally, a genuine sports person and an Olympic gold medalist. Second tallest fighting talk panelist ever just behind Martin Bayfield. But an inch tall, I know, an inch taller than Richard Osman, Olympic gold medalist. Second tallest fighting talk panellist ever, just behind Martin Bayfield. But an inch tall, I know, an inch taller than Richard Osman, Rower, Arsenal fan. Bio also claims he played basketball and at 6 for 8 does have the Ring of Truth. Moe! Hello, Mo! So this, I think, is going to be the payoff for my foot size inquiries because I had a little look down earlier on. How big are those flippers? Size 13. There we go. And if you're playing football. 12. What? Yes. You want to fill the ball. You do not want to feel the ball. No, it's the first point going straight to know. No, he did rolling because you couldn't play football. That's the only reason. The only reason you do something as far. That is very true. To be fair, very true. Yeah. But are you going to pick on me? No, I'm not. I'm not. No, you are not. Although he's used to a smaller man telling him what to do. Bro, bro, bro, go harder. I didn't know you've been a professional copse. All right, let's get started then. A bit of drama at the All England Club, as they announced they are to dispense with real life line judges at Wimbledon at the cost of 300 jobs for a announced they are to dispense with real-life line judges at Wimbledon at the cost of 300 jobs for a fortnight every summer. But who else, besides Wimbledon tennis line judges, must be worried about their jobs becoming obsolete. Kate. I have some questions about the second umpire in cricket, but we can get on to that another day maybe because I think the fourth official in football, my question really is what they actually do apart from get berated by Artetta. I looked on the FA's website to just check what the deal is supposed to be is. But it's like they're supposed to be proactive in dealing with players and managers. But I don't, I hate the idea of people losing their jobs. So let's say we are going to perhaps dial down their proactivity. Do you remember the other day at the Newcastle Tottenham game when the liner got injured and the fourth official had to come on? Very nice. And I think they should lean into that. I think they should have a little warm-up box, just constantly being ready with the oranges, ready to go just in case there's any issues. Yeah, right. Yeah, exactly. Just in case there's any issues with the main referee team. In you go. Yeah. Flex. Just in case there's any issues with the main referee team. In you go. Flex. Central midfielder's. What? Just a normal midfielder. What is the job of a midfielder? Do everything. Attack, defend, tackle, play through balls, score, getting people's faces, foul, everything. If you are working, what position you play, play Central Midfield. What's your job? That's your job. Do your job. Excuse me. That was, I mean, on your behalf, deal, I'm so sorry. I will have one more go on it. Just do the impression. Do your job. No, it actually gets worse. And worse. Well, anyway, if you ask Roy Keen, right, it says your job to do everything. Yeah. You ask Gen Z now, you're a midfielder. I'm an attacking midfielder. I'm a holding midfielder. I'm a six. I'm a box. I sit in front. I protect. No. So you're... So midfielder's, they're a dying breed, mate. So you're saying the central midfielder, just the job title, gone. Gone. Because they don't. Spoken like a true man United fan. No. So we're all watching the swimming or the diving or the water polo at the Olympics. And we always see these figures on the side of the pool. The lifeguards, they're totally redundant. Everybody knows how to swim in the Olympics. Let's be honest. We've all seen them there, sat there, boring, looking for lawn. The only time I've ever seen them called into action was this summer in Paris, where one of the lifeguards had to get in to get one of the swimmer's caps because it had sunk to the bottom of the water. In that moment, with a swimmer, not the trucks. I burnt into my retinas. You know, you know it too well, Rick. But did the swim at a loss his cap? Did he forget how to swim to retrieve the cap? You're going to have to get that place. It's busy being an Olympian, as I'm sure you know. So he doesn't, he's not, that's part of the job. It's not part of the job description. To go and get the cap. You understand that you've got people to do that stuff for you. Swim is a different sport then. I had to carry my own boat. Yeah, if you, listen, if you drop your oar in, I think you would have been getting down to the bottom of the river. Because I think you're a nice guy. That is the worst Yorkshire man impression. I had to carry my own boat from the poshest sport in the history. What's your answer, Neil? Well, I would just point out, if you remember the 1988 Olympics, the lifeguard was used because a brick fell into the deep end and there was people in pyjamas needed to get the brick out and that is part of lifeguard training. I'm going to say caddies. Flapping the pajamas. Get the air in. Caddies, why do we need caddies? I mean, it's just you get a laser distance calculator on your phone, you can get every golf course to your phone. My friend is an amateur golfer and he can actually stand anywhere in the world and any golf course on the phone, any golf course in the world, and download sexless jokes to his watch. So he has everything he needs to be a golfer. You know how far you hit a six iron. You've hit it a million times before. It's a little fellow not carrying my clubs for me though. I can't get that for that. Put wheels on your bag save 10% of your winnings. It's not like the golf course changes. If there was a random... If every fourth hole was suddenly made of basalt or something like that, or lava. Glad to see it. You would pay to see that. The floor is lava. Good luck, class. All right. Question number two comes from you, the listeners, who are posting on our social media channels. If you want to pose a question two, jump onto our Twitter, Fighting Talk 316, or FT316 on Facebook. So I plugged this last week, and it turns out some people do still have Facebook. So welcome new members to Ft 316 a place I will never go. This week's question two comes from Patrick Baker. Hello Patrick. Hi Rick. Can I call you Pat? Of course you can. Can I call you Patty? Yeah, go on then. Can I call you Pascahate, Pascake Baker's Man? Nah. Okay, Patty it is. So your theme, actually, Patty, will not be Baker Street because that belongs to Dion Dublin for reasons. Actually, I don't think you can recall, other than the fact he plays a saxophone. Your theme tune is, can I find it? Yes. That is, that's the bake-off thing. Yes, I can have worked. And what are you up to, Patty? So, yeah, just got the day off with today because I'm in an amateur dramatic production this evening. So, yeah, just chilling out. Tickets still available? Yes, yeah, tickets available for tonight and tomorrow. And what is your question, Patty? So I'm a Leeds United fan, still recovering from the Sunderland game. So following on from Ilamelié's Howler in the 97th minute to snatch a draw from the jaws of victory, I'd like to know what is the greatest or most unexpected last minute in sport history. It's a very nice question. Also, good use of Howler, because that mistake is almost dictionary definition of Howler. I'll start with Neil. I'm going to go for Wiggins' last minute goal to win the FA Cup final against Man City. Man City had beaten them twice already in the league. I think they'd beaten them six or seven times before in the previous kind of in a row meetings. Wigan were relegated only three or four days later they were only team to have won the FA Cup and been relegated in the same year or same week actually bittersweet win like picking up your trousers from the bedroom floor and finding a fibre in them and then realise no you're not your trousers it was unexpected that they win Ben Watson that was unexpected that they win. Ben Watson that was unexpected as well. Ben Watson has broken his leg against Liverpool only six months previous to that and if you think as the hard tackling Liverpool players that have had down throughout the years Graham Soon as Steve McMahon. Ben Watson broke his leg in a tackle against Rahim Sterling which is deeply unexpected but he came back won an injury time and a goal that would go down in history, I suppose. This is the city of Aguero, Silva, Yayatorre, Tevez, against the Wiganback three of Richard Ashcroft, Roy Keneer and George Formby. So, deeply unexpected, I would have said. Flex. Carl Frotch against Jermaine Taylor in 2009 in Connecticut. Carl Frotch was down for the first time of his career in the third round. He was down on two score cards by at least four points. And what does he do in true boxing style? He bites down on the gum shield in round 12. And he unleashes a barrage of punches on Jermaine Taylor. Jermaine Taylor doesn't even know where he is. He forgot he was in America. The Americans saying, who's this British guy? We don't know who he is. Well, they knew afterwards because he went on to retain his title. And that is definitely in history. And when you're talking about in boxing, the fine margins, and we talk about when the corner lies to you, we talk about, you know, fake advice. No, no, he was in big, big trouble and he needed that as a champion and he just absolutely produced the goods. You don't mess about with the cobra. Mo. Yeah, so my last minute, unexpected moment would be, let's cast our minds back to 1993, the first ever Champions League final, Marseille versus A.C. Milan. It turned out to be the last ever game and the last ever minute for a 28-year-old Dutch forward Marco Van Bastian. The three-time Ballandoor winner was sobbed off in the 86 minute due to another ankle injury, never to play again and having to retire two years later, a premature end to one of the greatest footballers, so the unexpected last minute for those that were in the crowd at that day. And Kate. First of all, Pat, do you want to plug your show? Yeah. Tell us what your show is called. So we're doing a production of a few good men. Uh-huh. Musical? A group called, no, no songs. Thankfully, I haven't got the voice for it. You need me on that wall. It's Rabina Hamadurity Action Society at the Memorial Hall in Robina. Just outside, you know, Cardiff. Awesome. That's my answer. It's asking you that. Well, you're losing points, obviously,. Awesome. That's my answer, is asking you that. Well, you're losing points, obviously, for that. That was on-expected laugh. That was unrespected laugh. That's pathetic. Speed skating is normally, as I understand it, for the extensive watching of speed skating that I've done in my life, normally a very serene sport. We take you back to 2002, the final of speed skating at the Winter Olympics, the USA and China, battling it out at the front. Korea, they'll be going around, I think it's like eight laps or something, eight or night, I can't remember. Anyway, they're battling out, very serene. Finally, it was Korea, cuts in on the inside, knocks the skate of the USA, I think, who knocks into China, who knocks into Canada, there's only five in the thing. Stephen Bradbury comes through for Australia and claims gold. It was more like an unexpected 10 seconds, but it was still absolutely. Nice to a bit of domino rally effect. It was un-filly. And then look on his face as he crosses the line because they're still, watch it back if you haven't seen it recently, they're still trying to throw themselves over the line to get there and try and get their gold. And he's just like, you're a regular. If you haven't seen it recently, it's pretty much guaranteed no one has seen it recently. I don't know, I watch it once a week or something. It's so good. Okay, there's a lot of points in there. Well, you're a spurs fan. Lovely. Boom. Patty, where are the points going, please? They're all great answers. So, top stuff. Thank you, Kate, for being interested in the show. I would love to give a point to Flex, but he's a man United fans. And just to apologise to the fact that when I told my mother I was coming on the show, she asked me, is Lee Delamere going to be on there? I've got to give the points to Neil. I hope Melier signs an extension. Thanks very much, Patty. Good luck with a few good men. Thank you. The production. Now on to... It sounded like an entirely different success. Coming to a local park here you. Boris Johnson sat down with Five Lies Matt Shirley this week. Matt posed this question to the former Prime Minister. Lots of people think you're a liar. Are you a liar? I know. And I bet nobody has ever accused Romaine of being big, fat, pants-on-fire liars for the things that they said about what was going to happen to this economy after Brexit. So what I'd like to know is where in sport are pants aflame? Mo. The golden summer of 2016. And Ryan Lockday, the Olympic swimmer, US swimmer, had just on a night out, falsely claimed that him and his teammates had been held at gunpoint and robbed. But it was later revealed that the whole story was fabricated and himself and other athletes had actually been involved in a confrontation at a gas station. And they ransacked the place causing lots of damage much to his humiliation the CCTV footage came out a few days later and blow his cover absolutely insane stuff but i do never less watch that CCTV once a week um kate we have to be careful with all of these conversations i guess i'm going to talk about tennis player, Richard Gaskay, who got a positive test for what we're calling it recreational illegal substance at this time on the radio. Gaske, of course, was cleared by the Court of Arbitration for Sport. Yeah. And he got off, so he definitely didn't take effel mention recreational illegal substance. I'm just going to point to the fact that his, well, his explanation for how it happened was that he kissed someone in a nightclub who had taken the recreational illegal substance. It's in my system, but I didn't put it there. That's insane. I didn't know that. That's amazing. The lesson, know that. That's amazing. The lesson, there is. Don't lick the gums of coming you meet in a nightclub. Can I just say what a pleasure it is to hear that half man, half golden retriever, former Prime Minister on the radio, by the way, that milky bar keys. He doesn't get enough coverage. That's what I always think. We need to hear more from this man. Every time a football chairman gives the vote of confidence to the manager, they are lying. It is always the same. The manager is at the press conference. I'm told to have the full backing of the board as a man slowly scrapes his name off the office door behind him. They are behind me 100%. I have no doubts. I don't know why there's a removal van in my parking space. They've rented a storage space in my name. That is news to me. The only reason they're taking my pass off me is because they want to give me a new special pass. A better pass. They are lying. Your days are numbered. Well, I mean, at least Jim Ratcliffe had the sort of decency to make it very obvious that you think Sen Hague is rubbish. Flex. Mo will know this man very, very well. I mean, at least Jim Ratcliffe had the sort of decency to make it very obvious that you think Senhag is rubbish. Exactly. Flex. Mo will know this man very, very well. Arson Venger. Because in the prime era of the Barclays Premier League, as we've been hearing so much in social media, this man would proceed to tell us in every postmats interview when there was a big flashpoint in the game that he did not see it. And that was what we heard for his whole career. Arson, think that was a red card? Arson, you got a yellow card for this? Arson, did you say, didn't see it, mate. Well, every camera picked it up. Every person in the stadium saw it. The bench saw it. The players saw it. But everybody, but you saw this instance. So I'm just thinking, Arson, we always knew he was lying. It actually become quite a trademark for him. That's what I'm saying. It's kind of iconic. He's a liar. He's actually amazing. He's extremely charming, and Moe's not having it. He's not saying because the moment he left Arsenal, he's not alike. He got glasses. He just didn't have the time to go get his eyes tested when he was managing the club. That was all. He was actually amazing he was such a great football manager, isn't it? He seemed so little football. I seem to remember. Early on. He was such a great football manager, isn't it? Early on in his career at Ardoll. I seem to remember him with glasses. He misplaced them. Very hard to find your glasses when you haven't got your glasses. Yeah, that's true. All right, let's check in with the scores. Very low scoring, and I don't know if that's to do with the quality of the answers or the quality of the judging. Maybe a bit of both. Kate, you are trailing behind on five. You have lost quite a lot of points for various reasons. Mo, decent six, flex has got eight. Neil out in the lead on nine because he was confused by someone's mother with a motorway service station. Right. We're going to stick with politics, actually. The Labour party have now had their first 100 days in power and I think it's safe to say the honeymoon period is over for Prime Minister Kea Stama but where could the same be said in sports? Mo Sorry Flex but Sir Jim Rackleaf's honeymoon is officially over at Man United It's quite a bad honeymoon is what I think? The takeover by him came with such optimism, a promise of hope, but he's only sacked the long-standing members of the staff in a cost-saving money move, tearing out the heart of the club. And the man that he should be sacking is still at the helm. At the moment, he's currently totally distracted by the America's Cup, and it's such a sad thing to see on social media, Man United fans arguing over whether they can eat a birriani whilst watching Man United play. Good friend of mine, Saeed. He does like a good biryani as well. Right, flex. Sorry, Kate. Just go round. Sorry, yeah, fair enough. Big Ange mate I tell you what High Line for Life Vicario playing in the 10 I tell you what It's over mate It's over At the beginning It was a breath of fresh air Who's this Australian Coming over to here He's been in these leagues He's fantastic He's a breath of fresh air He plays exciting football Even if he's down to nine men Still same principles mate We'll play the same way Even if he's down to nine men, still saying principles, mate, will play the same way even if it was five. Game would be abandoned, mate. Wouldn't play the same way. Game would be over. But he tried to change the Spurs mentality. He wants to win football matches. He wants to win trophies and he wants to finish as high up the league as he can. But Topham fans, the DNA of our club, we will not have that. We do not want to do that. Don't try and win this game against Manchester City. We must stop Arsenal. It doesn't matter if we can finish higher up the league. So clearly, even Topton fans have gone from the first 10 games of last season, where Big Ang was amazing to, when's he going to change? This is, this is too, he's too stubborn. He wants us to win games. He wants to let Arsenal win the league. We can't have this. It's over. I'm Big Ange forever. Yeah, go on Kate. Just turn my world upside down. Favorite Australian since Mick Dundee for me. Since Mr Fisher from home and away. Yeah, and Stephen Bradbury, obviously, who I watch every week. Of course you do, yeah. Gary O'Neill at Wolves. Yeah, he was, I don't know how much any of you. What's him being booed out of the stadium at the weekend. That's harsh, though. Horrible star. Bulls, bottom of the league, still winless, yet admittedly, they lost their, they sold their captain, they lost their best player. But that's, that's the deal, if you're in charge of Wool's football club, unfortunately. And, uh... I think wolves are going to be all right. Well, I honestly do. Personally, I'm a big fan of Gary O'Neill, but I don't think... Why are you putting the boot in then? I'm not putting... Because you want him at Spurs't think... Why are you putting the boot in then? Because you want him at Spurs. Well, you're not putting the boot out. More importantly, what size is the boot you're putting in? Yeah. Do you want to fill the ball or not? Yeah, I just didn't want to make you guys all feel small. I'm actually a size 14. I did have clowning on my weekend. Neil? Celtics Champions League honeymoon is over. It didn't last very long. They hockeyed Slovak and Bratislava. Brendan Rogers must have been thinking, New Year, new me, guys, it's going to be good. None of this big fish small pond anymore were going places and then they got a spanking that Max Mosley would be proud of. They were hockeyed 7-1 by Barisha Dortmund who just couldn't put a foot wrong. So you keep shipping goes like that. You either Max Mosley would be proud of. They were hockey 7 won by Barisha Dortmund who just couldn't put a foot wrong. So you keep shipping goals like that. You either buy a new defender or just hire a tip-off coach to be your set piece coach. But that's three different teams. Three different Celtic teams he has managed that have lost seven goals in Champions League. Yeah, it's not pretty. That is... That is... He actually, to be a similar approach to manage. That's it for the Champions League. Yeah, it's not pretty. That is... He actually, to be a similar approach to Ange. That's it for the first half. A first half that... It's unlikely to live long in the memory. But that's okay. Everything's quite disposable in the modern media landscape. We will be back with more fighting talk after the news and the actual sport. Welcome back to Fighting Talk. Welcome back to our panel, Neil Delamere, Flex, former intern Kate Mason and Mo Spie. Currently, who is in the league? Flex and Neil tied on the top. Likely to change, though, because they both look knackered. We are on the BBC Sounds Up as well, which means if you've just joined us, you can go now and listen from the start. You didn't miss that much. Right, game changer time. It was a real game changer last week. Kath Murray had three points stolen from her to deny her a place in the final by three points. Now, currently being massaged and fed ahead of his five live presenting shift this afternoon. Mark Chapman had this to say about the sport of rugby league ahead of today's grand final. I do think it's an afterthought in most of the newspapers and I have to say in most of the sports bulletins on TV and radio. I can absolutely confirm that, always last in the sports bulletins. But what sport do you think is disrespected even more than rugby league and should be forcing its way up the sports agenda? And because this is fighting talk, you can also tell me what it should replace. Small caveat here, I have predicted, and I've got it written here what Kate will say. And if I'm correct, you will lose a point, Kate. Just seeing that. I'll start with you, please, Neil. I've just rejoined the swimming club for the first time in a long time. I have a little tip for you. If you join the swimming club and you don't know which lane to go into, look what's written on other people's caps. It'll tell you how experience there. So I joined and I saw Dublin triathlon. Then I saw, no, then I saw Paris Iron Man. And then I saw Peppa Pig. And that was a lane for me. There was a tiny older woman there with Bailey's in her water bottle and the goggles you get from a sunbed. She was a total legend. Hang on, wearing a pepper pig hat. Yeah, yeah. January for a minute, I thought you as a mid-40s man were like, and so I just went and swam with the children. I was like, I don't think you should do in that. First, the Delibir services and then Tim were children. No. This woman was a legend. She's a tiny little lasmatic woman using her inhaler as a snorkel. I think swimming should be back more, more. It's a higher profile than it is. I'm not saying this. It's a great spectator sport swimming. I love it. Yeah, absolutely. They go up, they go down, you know, with the finish. Sometimes, you know, oh, he's bringing in the legs now. Am I saying this because it's for the first time Ireland's win won three Olympic medals we had mona mccherry we had Daniel whiffin and daniel whiffin did miss a trick though because he didn't do great in the 10k swim but he has a twin brother who's a fourth fastest in europe why didn't he dip down mission impossible sub it and hammer every else, but swimming needs to be more prevalent than it is for the next few years. Yeah, that's a good one. Mo. Winter sports. We wait every four years for the winter games to come round, and we all get wrapped up in the moguls, the curling and the super G's. Let's get Ski Sunday on BBC one. Crime time slot, make it all year round, round chase the snow and let's get rid of tennis there's no more Andy Murray just drop it let's just get rid of tennis tennis is gone tennis is done oh seriously first first ski you think of just just go around first ski you think of when you think of ski Sunday anyone green bell grand bell no you can't just say no no one no one I just you think of when you think of ski Sunday anyone? Graham Bell. Graham Bell. Graham Bell. No, you can't just say. No one? No one? I just immediately think of Alberto Tomba. No one else think of Alberto Tompa? Fine. Just me then. I'll give myself a point. Lovely man. Flex. It's lovely. Got a little bit rogue. Can any of you guys tell me who the current holders of the British American Football Association is? Of course not. Yes. You can tell me who the champions are of their equivalent of the Super Bowl, which is called the Brit Bowl. Absolutely not. Can you tell me who performed at the Brit Bowl? I guess. Rihanna? Not Rihanna, not Ed Shearin. Was it the Welsh? No. Was it Paddy the Baker earlier on with the New Goal? Was it the U-Flats? No, it was Jedwood. Oh. Jedwood. I made that up. But the London Warriors beat the Bristol Aztex in the Brit Bowl. That is the equivalent of the Super Bowl. American football is played in this country and we don't know anything about it. Meanwhile, we got Kate's mob having NFL in this country, bringing it over from America. We haven't even taken care of our own America. You can't hold Tottenamots were responsible for that. It's their fault. Sorry, there's a team called Bristol Aztec. Bristol Aztecs, mate. And is there a big connection between Bristol and the Central American? Whoa, I'm going to say there is. There has to be. Okay. It has to be London Warriors. That's quite a stereotypical name for maybe American football team. But I think they need a lot more exposure. There is, the Brit Bowl is massive, huge. It's been taking place at stadiums and we have no idea it was going on. Brit Bowl is huge and we need to get our biggest someone like Ed Sheeran should be there and people, the best of British talent, Storms he should be performing. That club is... My mate Mont Montezuma, absolutely loves it. He loves them. Huge in Tenok, Titland. Yeah. He's got an amazing West Country accent, hasn't he, Montezuma? He does, yeah. One thing I will say about the best of British is, and are not Cassius Burtains about the level that American footballers play that in this country. But Vernon Kay did he used to play for London Warriors, didn't he? Did he? Yeah, did you? Did he? Did he? Nothing that man can't do. Play American footballers play that in this country. But Vernon Kay did he used to play for London Warriors, didn't he? Did he? Yeah, did you? So nothing that man can't do. Play American football. I'll clear a bit of space, yeah. Kate, now, I've got my prediction. Well, you might remember, Rick, that my attempts to introduce good quality cycling coverage, this very radio show. That was not what I predicted. We're met with a complete derision. So I'm going to take it a bit further and talk about mountain biking. Because the season has just ended last weekend in Canada. And I don't know if you guys remember. You must remember from the Olympics. Tom Pickup, absolutely kidding up. One of the highlights. One of the highlights of the whole Olympics. Agreed. And the French fans bringing him. That was so good. But there's also, I'm sure you will have seen on Instagram, on TikTok all sorts of places, the downhill mountain bike as well. These people throwing themselves down a mountain on a bicycle for three to four minutes. There's a guy, Amri Perron, who was racing at the weekend, who broke his neck last year, came back to win this year, a year on. These people deserve to be pushed up the running order. I would replace match of the day with it, really, which is useful because I actually, you know, I actually present a bit of a mountain bike. Oh, I see. It is genuinely good fun to watch, though. And again, like swimming, very easy to understand. These guys are throwing themselves down a mountain on a bike, their lunatics. It's good fun to watch though. And again, like swimming, very easy to understand. These guys are throwing themselves down a mountain on a bike. They're lunatics. It's good fun. All right. Is that everyone? I actually predicted squash. Oh, I do love squash. Yeah. I do love squash. But the squash is in the Olympics next time now, so I don't need to... Don't need to push it anymore. Your work is done. All right. So that was the game chance. So I need to push it anymore. Your work is done. All right. So that was the game chance. So I need to decide where the points are going. So I've got the mountain biking, British American football, not a chance. That's the problem. No one cares. The swimming winter sports is too general. I think, I think, I'm going to give it, Kate. I'm giving it to the mountain biking. You're taking five points, but where are you taking the five points from? You can take five from one person. You can take three from flex, one from one for it. You can do whatever you like. Can I actually? Yeah? You need these five points. Three off Neil. Three off Neil. And two off flex. And I'll leave Moe at least because he's not on it before. And we were on rowing at the, we were part of the coverage team in the Olympics. It's not talking about. That's going to stop. He's going to come and he's going to. You just wait. She should get a mark. Yeah, she just has. Don't worry. She just has. I made to regret that by no himself as well. Not just by you. All right. Next question. So that has... Well, that's really equaled things up, actually. Olympic 800 metre gold medalist in Paris. Keely Hodgerton has admitted that running is horrible. Let's be honest. You're out of breath a lot. I'm tired all the time. So I want to know what in sport have you tried and found horrible or something horrible you do and still go back for more? Mo. So I was going to have a go at Keely for, you know, you should never berate your own sport. But then I thought about it. But then I thought about it and I was like, I think Rowan tops it, to be honest. I did it 18 years of my life. I went backwards. I couldn't see where I was going. I had sore hands, had blisters. Perhaps it was. I had cuts. I had 18 years of my life. I went backwards. I couldn't see where I was going. I had sore hands, had blisters. I had cuts. I had sores on my bum. The Great British Weather. Whatever it threw at us, three times a day, 49 weeks of the year, we had to go row in. Just awful. The worst part of it all, if you can get all of the things that I've just mentioned there, if you're really lucky, you get to go in a boat with a cox. And they're at least a foot and a half shorter than you, and yet they have the biggest voice in the boat, on the land, and they think they know everything. Enough said. Your cox is listening to this right now. Screaming. Hey, Henry. All true. Neil. Offh true. Neil. Oh, thanks a million for going after the evening with my brilliant story. Oh, I was a cox for many, many years. No, triathlons. I have done two. Why am I doing a triathlon? Every bone in my body cracks. When I get up in the morning, it sounds like an open fire. There's hissing and spitting and then a log falls out. It's horrendous. And I've done... Do you know how fit the really fit people are in a triathlon? And how disheartening it is to finish the swim and then meet a fella coming... When you've got two disciplines left to go, and meet a fellow coming in the opposite direction, in a medal, putting his bike back into his power. It's deeply depressing. I don't want to do it anymore, but I'm driven because I'm middle age. I've got to say this with the greatest respect. You don't look like a guy who does triathlons. No, no, I, no. It's a conference. Yeah. Of sorts, yeah. No, it's not a compliment at all. He's got a wetsuit under that. Yeah, that's my excuse. Yeah, but what size? Do you want to fill the ball? Flex. I went with something that I tried and found horrible in the name of Olympians, actually. I got the privilege, actually, to do a session with Max Whitlock, which was unbelievable. We were both ambassadors for a company at a time. It was brilliant, so they put us together to say this would be funny. What? Have you at the sort of an equivalent level of ambassadors to Max Wheatler? Yeah, mate. I'll tell you what it was for, mate. For the B-Tech organisations. The qualification B-tech, we were both, because we both done one in our careers. And took us to different places, as you can see. I've done a B-tech in sport. He'd done a B-Tech in Olympics. Yeah. And got loads of gold medals. So, no, but I had the pleasure. And I was really looking forward to it. He's the most decorated British gymnast of all time. He's the pommel horse. So I've got to try it. I've got to try the pommel horse. That's even better to me doing the Olympics. And he's tiny as well. He's tiny. His arms are out here. I'm going, this can't be hard, though. I used to do break dancing. Yeah. I've tried this. I go well. He's tiny. His arms are out here. I'm going, this can't be hard, though. I used to do break dancing. Yeah. I've tried this. I'll go, Jim. And I tell you what. I tell you what. It was the most condescended strip me of being a man. I couldn't lift myself up. I couldn't turn. He's going, just try this. Gets on a pommel horse. Don't know what trick it's called. I don't know. it was a 10. He got a 10. Yeah. And the most basic thing you could possibly do, you wouldn't be able to do. And then he was like, right, can you do a cartwheel? I've done that. I've done a cartwheel. He does the most perfect cartwheel without even trying. Don't even think he used his hands. I think he just did it. And then it's me falling. Then he does a hand. Is there any footage of this? Yeah, there is. That's lovely. I would like to see. Put it in the show now. Of the footage is it's going to be as good as the pictures in my head right now. Yeah. Then I've got to go on the rings. The rings must be horrible. And I just pull yourself up. You're like, oh no, I can't do that. So I get little Max to sort of hold me in position. As a Max hold me. Don't let go. There's loads of foam there before. It's like Titanic. Yeah. So it was fun, but I left there going, what an awful sport. How do you put your body through that? And I just had so much admiration for him, but I never went back to fire again. No, I mean, he's incredible. I'll send you to that. Yes, please do. Kate. Yeah, I don't have any ambassadorial contracts that I want to flag in this show. I haven't been in any Olympics. What was your one, Neil? It was good though. Yeah. But I do do a bit of spinning. You know the spin class of the bikes? Now, I actually quite like it because it's 45 minutes. You're completely exhausted. Move on with your day. You feel incredible. All the endorphins flowing around. Brilliant. However, I went to a new class the other day that I hadn't, a new style of class that I'm not going to name check that hadn't been to before. And we get in, it's all normal, quite dark, you know, quite often the lights are like low. Like a night's up. You can get in your zone. I'm not, I don't love that, but you know, fine, whatever. Some people like it more. Anyway, we get up there. First of all, there's two little, little weights, tiny little weights sitting on the back of the bike, which we're apparently going to use to like do stuff with our arms. That's alarm bells. That is alarm bells. And then, second of all, the instructor goes, okay, so we're just going to get started with the warm up and then we'll get onto the choreography. This is not just a spin class. This is a spin class with dancing in it. We had to clap along to the beat. I couldn't do it. I was at the front, like the one lame duck who didn't realize what she'd got herself involved in. Everyone else is like, yeah, shout it. You've accidentally joined a cult. It's come over from America. Yeah, of course it's come over for America. Scores then, still very low scoring. Kate, somehow, how are you only on 15, Kate? Because you take all of my points off a bit. There's some sort of thief going on and we need to talk about it. But let's take it off there. Kate, Kate, I'm going to try and cut this. But I think we should talk about it now. We missed off your five points for the game changer. So actually, you can calm down a little bit. So Neil is in fourth on 16, flex on 17, Mo on 18. Kate, actually, you're in the lead on 19. So do you want to apologise and take all of that back, please? I feel like I earned those points. I don't think it's with much reference to you. Back down to 18. Tied in the lead with Mo. All right, to appease the MLB fans out there who were offended by Catherine Mary's anti-baitable rant last week, the playoffs are underway across America, including in San Diego, where Padre's fans are watching in a very pleasant October 28 degrees, which makes the two fans dressed in full centre outfits, including beards, sat right behind the batter in every TV shot, even more in Congress. So when have you been watching sport and thought, what on earth are you wearing that for? outfits, including beards, sat right behind the batter in every TV shot, even more in Congress. So when have you been watching sport and thought, what on earth are you wearing that for? Kate. First thing that came up was the footballers who wear gloves like in May or whatever. But I actually think, Pep Guardiola, he's a man on a lot of money. He's obviously got a free pass to the City Club shop. Why is he wearing absolutely every garment that city has ever produced for fans he needs have a bit of pride man mix it up then he wears a lot of stony he wears a lot of stony well maybe he's heard the feedback maybe he's seen my teeth i know yeah i think he's one of the most stuff yeah i think you're about get the wrong three there have a go at at Sean Dynes. That's totally good at anyone. Well, I feel like that might say a lot more about you than it does about me. Well, it's not often an answer gets no points, but that has done it. Neil. I was watching the Bristol Aztecs the other day, and the quarterback had a helmet pads and then a human sacrificial head tied to his belt, which I think is a step too far. Anytime I watch golf during the 90s and saw Payne Stewart, I was like, dudes, God rest the soul, but what are you wearing? It's 1994. Are you going to the Great Gatsby's house after this, don't you? Be consistent. Be consistent. You can't get in your car. I think also look good, though. You can't, no. Okay, I don't mind the outfit, but he has to drive home on a jalopy. You can't watch a key to D, he has to read a John Steinbeck novel and accidentally strangle a rabbit. This is how this works. You're saying commit to the bit. Commit to the bits. Flex. Um, Gabor Kari, primarily goalkeeper between uh, 2004 and 2009, famously, Hungarian goalkeeper. Not that famously. No, definitely famous when I say this. He used to wear these awful grey jogging bottoms, mate. Everybody remembers that. Absolutely. He's very, very famous as though he was bang average. But they weren't even like colour-coordinated jogging bottoms, and they weren't even like club jogging bottoms. He just got his own from Prime up. He looked like a guy who forgot his kit week in, week out, and they're like, have we got anything? We got these great joggers. They were baggy. They were thick. His movement wasn't great in it. It didn't help him. They weren't aesthetically pleased. It's not like Alison, where he wear the tights. You might go, tell you what, good compression. Steve Grisovich, surely. Actually, yeah. That's true. But I just, it was iconic that he wore it. But we used to go, come on. You're a goalkeeper, mate. You have to be mad to go and go anyway. So, like, firm it. that he wore it, but we used to go, come on, you're a goalkeeper, mate. You have to be mad to go and go anyway. So like, firm it. If it's cold, you still got to be in shorts, mate. You're a goalkeeper. You're nuts. It's a little bit of part of football, isn't it? Mo. The French national team fashion show that happens every time that is an international break. They turn up at Claire Fontaine and they come out of the cars. And this week, no, but specifically this week, I know where you go. Turned up in a suit which looked good, very good, but a fluorescent hoodie with his zip all the way covered up over his head. He took a few steps out of the car. He couldn't see. They didn't know who was there, the social media and the press. So he unzipped ceremoniously to reveal that it was him. And his Liverpool players, his fellow Liverpool players berated him on social media. It's gone too far. French football should get back to playing good football and forget about the fashion. All right, I'm Sue Ness in the corner there. It's such good fun. And he did look like a fashion beekeeper. Yeah. It's enough of that. Okay. Finally, it's a one word of sort of in a one-liner. As Britain attempt to win the America's Cup for the first time, and it's a 173 year history, G.B. Skipper, I haven't looked it up, but I assume he's called a skipper. Ben Ainsley said of their New Zealand opposition, they are almost impossible to be, almost being the key word. So I want another sporting sentence where almost is also the key word. I'm Thank you. were almost playing on a road, the way they, how many runs they got, almost got to a thousand. They were almost playing quick cricket in primary school. Do you want to make quick cricket? Even if you don't hit the ball, you must run. And you play in when the weather was bad and you have to play inside in the assembly hall, and the ball would get stuck under chairs, get stuck underneath the stage. And you just rack the point, you just rack the runs up. Amazingly, we've got a four here. It's unbelievable. It's under the pommel horse. And with a score of 823 for seven to declare, nearly getting a thousand runs. The ball's under the pommelhoarse and flexes on it with Max Whitlock thinking he can do the stuff he's doing. It's got stuck in the pit with all the phone. The ball got stuck in there. It was the longest sentence. It was a very, very long sentence. Almost. England almost played on the road. Yes, good. Neil. Adametreori is almost a top class forward long sentence. Almost. England almost pale on the road. Yes, good. Neil. Adamitreori is almost a top class forward. He does everything but the very last bit. It's like finding out that Colin Jackson is brilliant over nine hurdles. Just going to commit to the bit again. You see him absolutely kill Kyle Walker for pace. Oh my God. It's like he's gone out on a date, he's found somebody, he's been unbelievably charming. He's bought on the back to his place. They said, I'm going to go upstairs. Join me in a minute. And he's contrived to lock himself out with his bed. That sounded like the voice of bitter experience there, Neil. I go home my own. I've lied about my shoe size. Well, yeah, of course you go home in your own. You do triathlons. Right. We've got about 15 seconds, I reckon, for some very quick, any other business. Flex. Who decided that we need to attach the caps, the lids on bottles? Why are you doing that? Credit it's on me. Get, yeah, recycling. I get that. We've already had a big push on that, so I will put it in a bin. I'll do my bit to make the world green. No problem. Do not attach it. I'm trying to drink the drink. It's getting the nose. It's awful. It's awful. Don't do it. I think the solution is you have to have it at a sort of right angle. You expect to have it on the tip of the nose. You just want it off to the side. The solution is don't do that. There's always a little bit in the lid. There's a hundred percent. It's stupid thing. No one likes it. but, you know, we are where we are. Mo. Adverts and trails during podcasts, they're always louder than the made content of itself. You're listening and then all of a sudden your ears are blasted with BBC sounds crashing through your head, mo. I don't think BBC sounds are the big offenders for adverts, by the way. Kate. I basically just came on fighting talk this week so I can get this off my chest, by the way. Kate. I basically just came on fighting talk this week so I can get this off my chest, which is that there's some holes in the wall between me and my neighbour. They're smoking. They're smoking. The smoke is coming in. I finally got hold of a name of a plaster who was going to come and plaster the wars. I was so excited. This is obviously time in my life. I'm so excited about the home improvements they're about to happen. The plaster is all booked in to come. This morning I get a text saying, oh, sorry, I didn't realize where Hammersmith is, so I'm not coming. It's too far away. Wow. I mean, could you not just get the polyfiller out yourself? I think it's more complicated. Okay, fine. A bit of court. Neil. If I ever go to an illegal website to look at a football match, the same pop-up window pops up, which is Becky 25 wants to chat. She's just five kilometres away. Now, I have been to New York, I've been to Tokyo, I've been to Bristol to watch the Aztecs, and I get the same pop-up win. Bing, Becky, 25 wants to chat. She should be five kilometres away. She's obsessed with me enough to follow me. The algorithms are following your behaviour online. No, she's following. They know that that's what you want. She's obsessed with me enough to follow me. The algorithms are following your behaviour online. No, she's following. They know that that's what you want. She's so obsessed with me. She will follow me to a foreign country, but polite enough to stay five kilometres away. I've got it on a ferry the other day. Like, bing, is she in a canoe? I think she's too fit for me if she's keeping up with a stennis ceiling ferry between Dublin and Holly Head. Just leave me alone. Okay, all right. Let's have a look at the final scores then. Kate, unfortunately, trailing in, in fourth. That's such an astonishing surprise. You were in the lead, Kate. I only came here to hate. Thank God to get the plaster news off night. You did. Yeah. Flex. Third, 22. Neil on 24. Mo, absolutely magnificent, Dave Flex, third, 22. Neil on 24. Mo, absolutely magnificent, Dave. Go on, Mark. 25, meaning that Moe and Neil go into defending and defensible. It's a ridiculous statement you have to defend. It will be painful. On occasion it could be career ending. It doesn't matter. Mo, you've finished on the most points, so you will go first with 20 seconds on the following. When I look back I am deeply saddened that I wasted my life rowing. Of all the sports that chose me it had to be rowing. Why did it not a talent identification scheme for basketball come in? I could have been the next LeBron James, I could have been the next Tierie-on-Rie but rowing chose me. It's an awful sport. It's terrible. All of its funding should be dropped. It should be taken out of the Olympic Games. It's not modernising. Just get rid of it. Rowan, me and you, we are done. Well, listen, Neil. Yeah, not a whole. Best of luck. Not a whole. But you've got to do it anyway. 20 seconds on. I'm glad that Rafael Nadal has retired. He did nat ball for tennis. What a waste of space. What? Oh, can only play on one surface? That's all I can do. Do it in the accents. I'm not doing it in the accent. No, no, I really was going to, I can't win this, so I was going to attempt to Spanish accent. But I'm not going to do that. He was a was a waster. He couldn't do it on a cold night in Stoke or indeed in Wimbledon or the US Open really properly. I mean, honestly, it's one of the easiest ones I've ever had to decide. couldn't do it on a cold night in Stoke or indeed in Wimbledon or the US Open really properly. I mean, honestly, it's one of the easiest ones I've ever had to decide. Moe on debut, you're the winner. Many congratulations. Hold your head high for the next few days. Maybe avoid your rowing mates, though. The rest of you, hang your heads low. Think about what you went wrong. Beat yourselves up. I'm obviously looking at you mainly, Kay. Thanks to listening. This has been a World's End production for BBC Radio 5 Live. The podcast Extra discussion will be happening right now. You can listen to that on BBC Sounds. Coming up after the news, it's 5 Live Sport. Hello and welcome to the Fighting Talk podcast Extra. We, I don't really know why, but we missed a couple of questions out. We're running a bit low on time. So we'll do one of them, which was this. Rob Beckett was on social media this week saying how much he hated the international break, rightly so. So let's give the former fighting talker some suggestions for football to watch this weekend. Neil? Oh, Greece. Greece, Ireland, my friend, because if I have to watch Irish football, other people have to watch Irish football. although we'd a great win against Finland. Great win against Finland. There's no such thing. There's no such thing. As much Irish football as me, great win against X, X, X, X, X. Yes, okay, fine. I went to see the England game, and, you know, around the hoarding, you flash a sign, swearing is never right. And you're like, you're not watching the same football. Aren't you going to find it hard to decide whether to back Greece, though, after the? Against England. After your little dance. Oh, no, that's over. Now, I've already moved on. Back to the regular jig. I would like to. Racist. I would, however, like to point out that I was disappointed by the Irish fans booing rice and greelish at the Ireland-Engling game. Not the intention of it, the practice. So Rice would pass to Grealish, and some people would continue the rice boo. So they'd go, boo. And then some people would start a separate boo. They would go boo, boo! And I just think we should have met up beforehand. Yeah, being unisoned. And picked whatever way we want to do, rice and grish. I think you've got to start a new boo. I think you have to start a new boo. It's a discreet boo, isn't it I just think we should have met up beforehand. Yeah, being unison. And picked whatever way we wanted to do. I think you've got to start a new boo. I think you have to start a new boo. It's a discreet boo, isn't it? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, because then at the end, the stats people don't know how many boo's rice got or how many boo's greelish gone. It has to be a discreet boo. Also, when you're continuing a boo, it does start to sound spooky rather than... There is a bit of a Scooby-Doo to us. Boom. We would have won the Champions League or the Nations League except for you pesky kid, I believe, Steve Carsley will never say it. Lee Carsley, my apologies to Steve Carsley, his friend. Yeah, I mean, Steve Carsley might do a better job. Mo. So everybody remembers Rob Beckett's stories during the Euro 2020. Yes. Glorious Ron Instagram story. So I want to take him to the Pyrenees for a true clash of the Titans. I want him to watch Andorra versus San Marino. Sam Marino, the lowest ranked FIFA football nation, got their first ever competitive victory and their first win in over 20 years. They're on the ascension of world football. Better to be there at the start of this amazing run that they're going to go on, be it they've lost their last two matches. This is the one that they're going to follow up with another win. I've always wanted to make a documentary about San Marino. So I feel like now might be the moment. I've always wanted to make a documentary about Andorra. Have you? Well, hereorra. Have you? Well, here we go. Have you seen Nextgo wins? You must have seen Nextgo wins to the documentary. Do you like that? It's got two heads of state like the Bishop of Barcelona and the French president. Whoa. Andorra. That's a checkdown. That's a great way to sell a place to anybody. Yeah. And it's good isn't it? It's really good. Flex. I wanted to go rogue and go something. I've got no interest in watching usually because these games are so bad in the international break. So I found myself in Venezuela. Yeah, the Premier Division. So top flight, none of this amateur stuff is top flight football. Yeah. A team out there called Bristol City. Yeah. We're going to go to the bottom of that league. Because there's a bottom of the table clash. There is a team called Inter de Barinas. And they will be facing Angostura FC. And Inter have lost five in a row. They've rock bottom with one point from 11 games. And Augusto, they've got three points from 11 games. And they're facing each other to be able to maybe start their season. There's two very, very poor Venezuelan teams. You're inviting Rob Beckett to watch. The worst of the worst, but I still think it'll be better than the Nations League. I do completely agree. Angestore might be bitter if they don't. Oh, Kate, where was that during the main show? You've done it the wrong time, Kate. Yeah. You scored a consolation goal. What a great goal, but no one will remember it. Spectacular stuff. Oh, man. That's basically, that's Ben Teke's goal against the United, literally, a game that we've still lost. A hell of a goal. What a hell of a goal. What a goal. We should take a moment because no one's ever going to remember it after this. Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. No, because we're good in the first half and then we become crap in the second. This is like reverse spurs. I think you should watch the Women's Super League which is still going on. Quarter to two, it's Arsenal Chelsea. It's not to have a serious answer actually. Chelsea, yeah, no, this is a genuine bit of advice for everybody. Chelsea would just come back from beating round Madrid 3-2. And I love how good Chelsea are in the women, because they're like, oh, we actually, you know, that wasn't actually that good, and we're not going to win the Champions League. If we play like that, they've just beaten Round of G3-2. I mean, Emma Hayes gone, are they still? Yeah, still good. Yeah, Bombaster's a good manager, to be fair. Okay, well, there's a terrible selection of games and then one good one. Here you go, Rob. Now on to the Fighting Talk rankings. We've got five rankers, one each. Rankers? Yeah, we are all rankers. And it's really off the back of Jordan Pickford getting his 70th England cap. Fifth highest-capped England keeper of all time. But is he one of our top five England goalies? I mean, on the evidence of the other night, Enou. So I want the five greatest ever England goalkeepers. Start with you, Kay. Who are you going to go straight in with Jordan Pickford, Rick. Okay. I appreciate you didn't do much to help me out in the old Greece game. That was some quite special stuff. But the particular goal I'm thinking of didn't count. So it doesn't matter. Making all of these, well, two consecutive Euro's finals. You can't argue with that. I only bloated to have done that for England. I think his records speak to himself. I also like his insane energy. I like the way that, you know, he's... But the fact that he's constantly angry. If he's ever asked to do his job, he's fuming. For me, that is the stuff. And just sort of like the way he's kind of... It's a bit of Vicario, actually. But Vicaro is even more shaky looking If he's ever asked to do his job, he's fuming. For me, that is the stuff. And just sort of like the way he's kind of, it's a bit of Vicario, actually. But Vicaro is even more shaky looking when he's doing that. Let's be honest. You can't really slide Vicario into the greatest ever England goalkeepers. I don't think. Mo, I can't be Pickford. He just wants the show to be about himself. So for me, and the stats don't lie, Joe Hart, he's the joint second most cats. He's got 43 clean sheets. He's got one of the highest clean, he's got the highest clean sheet percentage for any keeper that's played over 50 times or more. He conceives on average every 134 minutes. Questionable punditry trainers, the blacked out with the white souls. But that's the official gear that you get when you appear on matches of the day. However, as a pundit, he's decent. Yeah, no, he is. He is. I saw him working out in the gym in Germany, and he's got one of those tattoos that is just solid ink all the way down the arm. And I never quite, I don't get the... I presume so, but I just don't quite get the idea of it. Some tattoos could be really quite sort of beautiful. Is he trying to be invisible at the dark? I don't know, well, just one arm. So people think he's a one-armed man. It's the simple to say, I can withstand that much pain. He's the answer going to fugitive. Maybe. What is going on? I think, you know, like when commentators do a lot of stats and you don't trust them, I feel like his answers, he's done too many stats. He doesn't mean, again, done too many stats is the explanation for him. Sure and the short. In terms of Mo's answer. Yeah. We're like he's not confident on his answer. Stats don't lie. Stats don't lie. How many Premier League titles do Spurs have? All of them. Is that right? I didn't know that. Okay, so we've got Jordan Pickford. We got Joe Hart, Neil. Who are you putting in there? Yeah, founded in 1278 by a treaty between the Bishop of Ergel and the Count of Fois. So it is the President of Front. Well, there we go. Gordon Banks, you idiot. Yeah. It's just Gordon Banks. Keep your stats. Gordon Banks, you idiot. It's just Gordon Banks. Keep your stats. Gordon Banks, the greatest save from the greatest footballer of all time. That's it. Yeah, I mean, it's very, very... Case closed, but we can't all in the same thing. We're just helping you out. You can't all say Gordon Banks. Flex, do you want to go for Gordon Banks as well? Yeah, why not? No, look, we've got to have David Seaman in there. No, he must be in there. He was loved by 19. No, no, no. It was an accident. Ronaldino didn't even mean it. Ronaldino probably meant it. No, I think he meant it. Yeah, probably. No, what keeper, not just for the ponytail, but outstanding reflexes. Giant of a man used to come out, be commanding. He had fantastic reflexes. We all know that fantastic save against Sheffield United, the infamous save. But in an England shirt, and I'm a bit biased, giving away my age here. My first tournament was Euro 96. We used to live in Wembley. It could hear it all at the back of my flats. Yes, it was amazing. My mum says I really got into football then. Exactly. All from London. The Red Devils. And it's too easy for a big man to ignore those reflexes and do a simple sport. Like this, it's just required a big engine. Growing. You know what I mean? Well, that was the implication, but thanks you, thank you for finishing, finishing the joke. You should take Flex on tour with you. I'll be a cycling. I bet when Max Whitlock just nailed the landing, you went, and then put your hands together at the end. Oh, it is. Oh, you'll see me i did i've got more points for the finish than anything else um but yes david see okay uh i am going to go for a friend of this show david james not not i wouldn't necessarily say this to his face but not because he's the best keeper but just he was so handsome. He was very, and he still is. It's just a great-looking man. And that makes me forgive him most of the sort of basic handling errors. Beautiful, beautiful man. It's not where you hold so much against flex. Yeah, yeah. So let me spend ages trying to find the music. There it is. It wasn't bad, actually. Here we go. The five greatest ever England goalkeepers, and it's safe to say this is disputed. Jordan Pickford, nominated by Kate Mason, because I'm not entirely sure. Joe Hart, purely based on stats from Moe. Gordon Banks, because Gordon Banks is really the answer from Neil. David Seaman, because Flex grew up near Wembley and David James for me because he's handsome. That is your lot for this week. Thanks very much everyone. Beautiful. Thanks guys. Good. I got an autograph from David James as well. Oh well that means. Oh wow. It was like safe hands. Should have gone from David. I've got that for years. Hello there I'm Alastair Bruce Ball. Yes, Fantasy 606 is back. Every week we're going to debate and discuss all things Fantasy Premier League.
