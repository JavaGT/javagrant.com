This podcast is supported by advertising outside the UK. BBC Sounds, music, radio, podcasts. I'm seeing things that I don't want to see. I see the devil sit right before me. I'm Rick Edwards, but lots of people do. There's been a lot of chat in the press and online this week about my future on the show. I've been here a year. I've splashed the cash. I've got all my own people in. But let's face it, results have been disappointing. This is Fighting Talk. You expect more from a Fighting Talk team. The Director General of the BBC Tim Davy has asked if he still have faith in me. He said, I don't want to answer that question, but the Fighting Talk hierarchy must take stock and make some sensible decisions. He went on to say, we want to take Fighting Talk back to where it should be. It's not there yet, obviously. That's very clear. Thanks, Tim. I do hope Palace lose later, genuinely. The bottom line is, I need a result today. But I look at these panellists, and I'll be honest, I am worried. There's only one thing we need to say about our first guest. She's a villa fan. Fast woman. Catherine Mary. Hello, Kath. Hello, how we doing? Are you all right? Yes, I'm good. Do you want to do your Unai Emery eulogy now, or do you want to just sort of pepper it through the show? Unai, I don't know anybody called Uni Emery. Oh, good evening. Good evening. We've had a great week. It has to be said, and I promise not to mention the Mighty Claret and Blue more than five times in the show today. Okay, fine, fine. I'm actually going to do a little tally. You're going to. I should know you. I know you so well. That's one. That's the schoolboy era from Mary, isn't it? One, it is. As per school girl, I'd like to think. Next up, the chutney making, France dwelling, Blackburn supporting, murder book writing mod, which does narrow it down a bit. Tide with Dougie Anderson in Fighting Talk's best dress, but from a different era category. Ian Moore's back. I'm slightly disappointed with that. I'm straight ahead of Dougie Andy. Dougie is a very natty man as are you and you never disappoint to be fair. I don't even have to describe the outfit but it's something. I'm going to sting. Not sting the police, the sting, Newman Redford. That's what I'm going. Do you know what? Absolutely nailed it because of the hat. I'm one of my favourite films, so I will give you a point for that. I don't want to get too bogged down with this. But the chutney, are you making that for personal use, or are you dealing the chutney? I deal it. I sneak it across the border. I used to sell it at gig. There was a period when all... Selling chutney a gig? I mean, that's a career wasn't going brilliant. A period when comedians would get to the end of the set and go, I've got a DVD after you. I didn't have any DVDs and I make chutney. And it's got to spin it around. I mean, it's a sort of career, isn't it? Next up, a debut for this sport and gaming creator. One of the side men. He's got millions of YouTube subscribers and followers. We are desperately hoping to nab some of them. Obviously, Mani Brown's here. Hey. Hello, Mani. How are you? I'm good, thank you. Sorry to this point, not one of the sideman. I'm the brother. So when people approach me to say, oh, your brother's in the sideman. Brother of the side. Well, let me just correct. I'll just take a point off myself. I'll just write down, brother. There we go. Now, a debutante does need all the help they can get. So I'll immediately give you a point off myself. I'll just right now, brother. There we go. Now, a debutante does need all the help they can get, so I'll immediately give you a point for supporting the correct team. You're a Liverpool fan, yes? Yes, correct. Lovely stuff. It can be that easy, man. Finally, we've got a writer who's an old friend of last week's guest host, Josh Whitacom. They go way back. This is to their days as up-and-coming sports writers. Such good mates, in fact, that he's on this week. QPR, Bromley and Minnesota Vikings fan, Telegraph Senior Sports, something or other. Tom Gibbs. Hello, Tom. Hi, Senior Sports Writer, it's not that surprising a job title, isn't it? Fine, I'll take another point off myself, honestly. A lot of Chris is for these interests. Excited to see the Unbeaten Vikings in town. They're playing at the Tottenham Hospital Stadium. They are indeed. Maybe I will mention the mighty purple and yellow fewer times than... I'll keep a tally so that's one. Just to be clear, Mighty Claret and Blue, is that just filler or are we including West Hamlin? Burnley. No, no, no. Be surprised if they start banging on about Burnley. No, no, no. We're talking originals, my friend. Okay, that's one more from you, Cass. It's going well, isn't it, Rick? From your opening quotes read from the BBC boss, it's going well. Tell me if you're listening, this is actually quite a good show. All right, let's get into it then. Question number one is all about this lot. Palmer then forward towards Netto, lovely ball right into his path. Neddle pulls it back. Trow Felix on his debut. Second time around. It's a sixth goal for Chelsea now. So from being described as a basket case last month to being spoken about as potentially challenging for the title. If Chelsea are out of the basket, who is in? Ian? Well, Chelsea aren't out of the basket by anybody who describes Chelsea as title contenders are the basket case. They're in the basket. Absolutely. But I mean, if you want to keep the basket image going, they've only got one egg in that basket and it's called Cole Palmer. So without him, they're not going to get anything. Anyway, I think sports governing bodies, I think they're struggling. They've sold so many TV rights, and all sport is saturated now. Footballers, cricketers, Ben Stokes can't play the first test against Pakistan because he hasn't had time to recuperate. There's too much, but I love sport. I rely on sport, like a blind man relies on a dog. I need it, but there's too much. I love sport. I rely on sport like a blind man relies on a dog. I need it, but there is too much of it. Okay? I feel like I should be rewarded. Instinctively, I went for it. But, you know, you're going to get to the point where they're not going to be able to compete? You're going to get, you know those adverts for those broken donkeys in Spain? You're going to get footballers going, I'm a broken donkey, please send me some money. I'd love to go for a ride on an old broken footballer on a beach somewhere. Absolutely. I'd pay top dollar for that. Tom, it can only be Manchester United, and you might think drawing from 3-2 down against Porto might not qualify you as a basket case. Of course it does when you've led to NIL. And they're trapped in this purgatory Manchester United, where they look like they've turned the corner, but actually they realize they're as a basket case. Of course it does when you've led to nil. And they're trapped in this purgatory Manchester United where they look like they've turned the corner, but actually they realise they're on a NASCAR track and it's just corners going in circles forever. I mean, was that draw good news for Man United ultimately? Would getting a result at Villa tomorrow be a positive? Not really. It just prolongs the agony and extends the countdown to a new manager, which is all Man United fans can really look forward to these days. The moment they can feel some hope again. So the new bloke coming in and doing exactly the same as all in three decisions. Somehow now at United, they are pining for the midfield glory days of Paul Pogbert and Anda Herrera. It's so nice for other fans, though, isn't it? Mani. I'm going to go with Crystal Palace. I don't think anyone's going to see this one coming. Interesting. Reason being, I feel like they were in that place, kind of like Villa, where they're going to go with Crystal Palace. I don't think anyone's going to see this one coming. Interesting. Reason being, I feel like they were in that place, kind of like villa, where they're going to go to another level, and they've sold a leasee, and then they have Eze, Gehe, Wharton being linked with moves away. And I kind of look at them, like, do you guys want to move forward or do you want to make money? Like, where do you land with that? So now they're in like, they're not going to hold on to those guys, I don't think. Yeah, it's not looking likely. Cass. Well, talking about holding on to guys in the basket at the moment is definitely wolves who have lost a lot of players. They've got a lot of injuries. But they are still searching Wolverhampton Wanderers for their first win of the season. They've had one point from six games. They are bottom. They play... That's Gary O'Neill keeps saying. We're playing pretty well. But it doesn't make a difference. If there's no points coming on the board, it's a result-based business. I remember a collective... Collective grove at the beginning of the season from Wolves fans when the fixtures were announced. And in their defence, they have played four out of the top five teams. Yes. But they've got to turn it around against Brenford. And as we know, Brentford are scoring quickly, right? What's that? The last three goals in 40 seconds. So Brentford fans don't be late because you could miss something. But now, Wolves at the moment need something before the international break because when they come back, they've got Man City. So they need to get out that basket, man. Any mention for the tally? No. Good. Moving on to question number two then, which comes from you, the listeners who are posted on our social media channels. If you want to pose a question to just jump on our Twitter, which we will always call it, Fighting Talk 316 or Ft316 on Facebook, if you remember Facebook. I don't know anyone's on Facebook anymore. James Plowright is here to ask question to this week. Hello, James. Morning, Rick. Morning panel. Morning. I'm just going to this week. Hello, James. Morning, Rick. Morning, panel. Morning. I'm just going to give you your intro, which is this. Beautiful. But why, James? Why? Well, by day I work in sport by night, I cover the NBA Sports Illustrated in the USA, so I cover NBA basketball. That's a lovely job. I'm quite jealous, actually, James. What's your question for us today? My question is, after finding out that Man City midfielder Phil Foden has a passion for cart fishing, what are some other surprising hobbies for sports stars? That's a very nice question. I'll give you a point for that, James. So I'm looking forward to hearing the answers. Yeah, there's a lovely photo of Foden with a fish. This is bigger than him. I'll start with Cath, please. And I love that picture, by the way. Having caught a £16 fully mirrored carpet, Redmayr myself, I was in... No one cares about your fishing, Cat. Oh, Dean Macy. Former Olympic athlete got me into that. I'd like to talk to Dean Macy about his fishing. I just don't want to hear about yours. That's not very nice, is it? I'm just saying. Can we get Dean Macy on the line? No, no, no. The Dean machine. You know what? Dean won't come on if you diss the fishing. Not a chance. I'm dissing specifically your fishing. I'm not interested. Anyway, your phone. Well, well done. Very, very good. But David Beckham, let me tell you about, you know, he's been hailed, as we all know, one of the greatest and most recognizable midfield players of his generation. 19 major trophies, 115 England caps, a Spice Girl wife. Life is good. Not one of the top 50 best players of all time, I would argue. No. Just carry on. Anyway, he liked, back in the room, he likes a bit of fencing, we found out. What? What? He's a fencer. And we all know that he likes... As in on guard or as in putting up fences in his guard. Or stolen goods. He'll be... I don't think he'll be stealing... Of course your mind goes to that, Mr Chutney. Chutney boy over there. What's in this, Chutney? He doesn't still chuckney. He doesn't hollowed out. Put his own fences up. But he likes fencing. And also, let's not forget, we discovered he likes Lego building in lockdown. So he's got two major big, but the most thing just quickly that made me really laugh this summer. It went viral. They thought David Beckham was at the Paris Olympics for 12 days on a BMX bike, entertaining the crowds at the Paris Olympics. And it went viral. Oh my God, look at David Beckham at 49 with his BMX skills. It wasn't David Beckham. It was a look-alike. So he doesn't BMX ride, but he does like a bit of fencing. He does like Lego and he does like a bit of fencing. Okay, Mani, surprising hobby, please. I'm going to go Diogo Jota. He loves playing games. He's obsessed with him. And he's obsessed with FIFA, now at FC, whatever you want to call it. But he's literally, like, very good to play. And he's good, isn't he? He's good, yeah. Yeah, like, but he'll not only play it on the weekend. He'll go score a goal the next day and do a celebration, imitate in a controller. Like, he's better than me. It's very nice. And you're decent, right? Yeah, I'm pretty decent, yeah. Have you ever played him? No, not yet. We'll set that up. We'll try and set that up. Mr. Chutney. Well, Roll up, roll up. Mr. Chutney, in 1992 on the calendar. Oh, November's naked. Save the chat. I love Phil Foden. If there's an evolution of a mank, it's Phil Foden, isn't it? Just the look of everything gets up in the morning. He says, yeah, twisty bum, Allen's. I love it. Rashford, with his child literacy and campaigning to lift people having have a poverty, was quite a weird hobby, but good for him. But I'm going to go... Was it a hobby or a star? Well, I think it's more of a hobby. Or football might be a hobby at the moment. I'm going to go, Ronaldo. When Ronaldo first came over to England, he got this technique for learning English. He did bingo. And he's become, yeah, he's become obsessed with bingo. He loves... I've really thought you're going to say he. He did bingo. And he's become, yeah, he's become obsessed with bingo. He loves... I've really thought you were going to say he's become a bingo caller. Well, he could, do you know? Don't pass to a teammate, 68. 45. Well off, sorry. That free kicks mine, 49. In Saudi for the fees 73 and also you know it's great for getting out of training as well because he's obviously in Saudi Arabia he's just nipping down the mecca and oh you've done such great work in and then let yourself down Tom if you told the 16 million people who watched Dennis Taylor beat Steve Davis in the 1985 World Snooker Final that Davis would one day go on to be a respected techno DJ. They probably would have said, what's techno? But once you've explained that to him, they wouldn't have believed you. And they definitely wouldn't have believed that he would also be the modular synth player in the experimental band Utopia Strong. Because he seemed so vanilla, didn't he, when he started playing? But also because he was heavily involved in Snoopylupi, which is not the first step you want from any musician. But since then, he's played at Glastonbury, Wembley Stadium, and a tap room in Bethanyl Green. Never mind a hobby, it's a second career for Steve Davis and a great one. But does he sell chutney? Do you know what? There's no money in that. Extremely enjoyable set of answers, James. I Do you know what? There's an extremely enjoyable set of answers, James. I don't know what you thought. Are you still listening, James? Points wise, to move on. I'm not going to give them to money because Rick, you've been too many to give them to Catmary because I love my fishing. And as a kid, I'd assign Dean Macy's fishing rods to go Dean Macy. Thank you very much. That's good. But also, I don't really get a slap. A slap of celebration for Mary then. Thank you, James. I'm glad it wasn't lost on everybody. Thank you, James. Excellent question. Excellent answers. Have a nice weekend. Now off you pop. I'm glad it wasn't lost on everybody. Thank you James. Excellent question, excellent answers. Have a nice weekend. Now off you pop. Next question. And very likely one of the answers is all about this. Villa played for it. Here's Geran. Geran for goal! He scored! He's done it again. But now he's done it in the Champions League! Time to nominate your European Man of the Week. Let's get this over and done with, Kath. You're on two mentions so far of a maximum five, remember? Okay, well, this is my third mention. Hands down, I was at Villa Park on Wednesday night, and genuinely so many of that Villa team could have been European Man of the Week. They were outstanding. But John Duran, the 20-year-old Colombian, the super sub, his fifth goal off the bench this season. Let's not forget, he made his Chicago fire debut in February 2022. That's not that long ago, and I mean the football club, not the TV show. And he's now vastly becoming, my imagine. Thank you very much. He's fastly becoming invaluable to Villa. The delight. Did he be starting? No, because the Unai wants one at front. He's still second fiddle to Olly Watkins and I think that he's finally accepting that because of what he does when he comes on and the lob over Manuel Noyer. It really did evoke memories of Villa's 82 European Cup win when we beat by and by one 40. To me that feels like another, that's your fourth. I'm sorry. It's in one answer. It doesn't. Not a chance. Not a chance. That's the fourth. That's going to stand. And Peter with or the 82 squad were at Villa Park on Wednesday as well to see that. The ball from Powell Torres, it was like there was a spirit of Gary Shaw who he sadly lost at Villa recently who was in the 82 squad. It's like there was a spirit of Gary on John Durand's shoulder when he took the ball down from Torres saying to him, go on, son, take the shot. And he lobbed it and it absolutely went wild. 100% the football man of the week. Yeah, it's a solid answer, actually. I spoke to Ian Taylor, villain. Oh, Tails! I didn't call him Tails. I just went Ian. And I said to him, we spoke to a Villa fan earlier on, or his dad actually, so it was probably the greatest night of his life. And I said to it, Ian, greatest night of your life? And he was like, nah. You can go back to Ian now. There's no affection there. Tom. Well, I think we're overlooking Kareem, Eddie Amy, aren't we? You've scored a 30-minute first half-hatrix for Borussia Dortmund against Celtic on Tuesday. First goal, great team move, left-footed finish into the top corner. Second goal, another left-footed finish also into the top corner, but from further out hit brilliantly. Third goal, left-footed bottom corner this time. So truly he can do it all, provided it with his left foot. Casper Schmichel is in goal, and Celtic are defending against him. Subbed off after 48 minutes, he'd done enough, job done. There's talk that Liverpool want him, isn't there, as a replacement of Salad, actually. Yes, there is. So maybe he could even have a greater impact in the Premier League than the former Norwich midfielder Tom, his namesake. Yeah, Mani. I'm going to go with Samu Amoridion because he was piling misery on Manchester United and anyone who does that gets one in my book. It was going to go to Bruno Finange, but, you know, another. Are we starting to go with Fanange now since he did the pronunciation? I'm sorry, I paid to my name. Yeah, Fernange. Yeah, that's where you're supposed to say it. It's a stripper name. Yeah. Typical for your mind to go there, Mr. Chalney. And Ian, your answer, please. Jonathan David. Canadian Jonathan David scored a 57th minute penalty for Leal this week, and they beat Real Madrid. I have a real problem with Real Madrid as a club, frankly. So any time they lose in Europe, it's good. And there was an extra crease on with it, because obviously Kiliun Mbapé's brother plays for Leo. He wasn't playing because he's injured, but he was leading the celebration. Why have he got a problem of Rao Madrid? Oh, the former favourite cub of a fascist dictator of Spain? There's one reason for it. Yes, okay, yeah, that's fair. And they don't buy his chutney. He tried to sell it in. No, the two big Spanish clubs, they're supposedly really short of money, yet they always need to just hoover up the best players. They find the money for the players, aren't they? Yeah, exactly. And I just, it just bores me. There's only two. No, I'm not going to go down that route, but it bores me. Fair enough. I don't want to easily get too bored here. Let's have a look at the scores now. Bear in mind, Kath, you are teetering on the brink of losing a serious amount of points because you have four mentors of villa already. And you are teetering on the brink of losing a serious amount of points because you have four menaces of villa already. And you are currently in the lead on 13. Ian and Mani tied on 10, Tom nestled in the middle with 11. Talking about yourselves, that's better. Now, I would like to take you back to this day, October 5th, 1946. The first game for Newcastle... never say this is not a current show. The first game for Newcastle United striker, Len Shackleton. Len hit the back of the net six times for the Magpies in a modest 13-0 win over Newport. That is a record that still stands today. 52,000 were there that afternoon to watch Shackleton's double debut hat trick. But who has had another near perfect debut? I'll start with Manny. I don't know. I tried to avoid this one, but Wayne Rooney against Bernabacci. Do you know what? You can't ignore it, unfortunately. It's spectacular. Absolutely spectacular. Free kick as well. Crazy. Not many people do that. So, yeah, it has to go to Wayne. Yeah, disappointingly. You're right. Yeah. Free kick as well. Crazy. Not many people do that. So, yeah, it has to go to Wayne. Yeah, disappointingly. You're right. Ian. Was that, Len Shackleton, is that that old footage of him pushing the goalkeeper into the goal? Is that the same? That was proper football. Yeah, the good old days. The good old days where you could break a few bones on a goalkeeper and people wouldn't complain. No, I'm good. Actually, very recent, this summer, Gus Atkinson made his test debut for England. Sensation. His bowling figures on his test debut at Lords were 12 for 106, which is just, it's just madness. It's actually the second best bowling figure debut because it's 12-102, but that was done in 1890. But the fact that... By Len Shackleton. Yeah, it's the main goalkeeper. But the romantic side of me loves this because it was done on Jimmy Anderson's last test match. So there was a real handing over of the bowling battle. Yeah, because you felt like, oh, they're doing the right thing. Yeah, they are doing the right thing. We've got this guy now. Cath. And we've already talked about, Tom's already talked about hat tricks, but netting two goals against West Ham in his proper manned city debut because no one counts, the Community Shield, was a good start for Erling Harland. But his arrival at Brousia Dortmund in 2020 was even better. They were playing against Orsberg. 55 minutes were gone. Dortmund were 3-1 down. Their title challenge was in tatters. They threw Harland on and in his first 20 minutes of German football he scored a hat trick with his first three shots, only requiring 10 touches to do so. They went on to win 5'3. It wasn't a near perfect debut. It was a perfect outstanding debut. Wow. to win 5.3. It wasn't a near perfect debut. It was a perfect, outstanding debut. Wow. First three shots. Yeah. And we all thought, well, he's not going to be able to do that in the Premier League. And it turns out, yes, he is. Tom. 2003 Open Championship at Royal St George. First major appearance for the American, Ben Curtis. 396 in the rankings, a 301 shot. He'd never played British or Irish Lynx golf before. He had to ask the club pro how to play the course. I don't know loads about golf, but presumably that conversation was something about taking account of the win, trying to get the ball close to the little hole with the flagpole, coming out of it, grass good, sand, bad. I thought you said you didn't know loads about golf. I've done my research. First golfers since 1913 to win on his major debut. Only got close to one other major, tying for seconds in the 2008 PGA. But he did play in the Ryder Cup that year, so not a total flash in the pan, despite the fact he's now giving up the sport to be a teacher. Very worthy career, of course. Let's squeeze in another question, I think. Bronio Sullivan has threatened to leave snooker again. If the rumours are true, the sport is to bring in personalised walk-ons with music, the rocket said, I'd be like, you know, I'm out of here now. What's been a moment when sport did something that caused you to say, you know what, I'm out of here now. Kath. I used to compete when I was doing my athletics. Younger. When I was having the year, yeah. I can't remember your 400 personal best ones. Just about snicked under a minute 30. I just didn't see you in either of the Olympics that I was at. Listen, you've got to say, that's, yeah, I don't know why I said that. I don't know. But when I used to compete for Great Britain and Northern Ireland, as I did since 13 years old, I used to compete in the European Cup. So basically think, guys, nations against nations, points mean prizes for your country, right? In 2009, they decided to rename the European Cup, the European Athletics Team Championships. And organisers thought, you know what? Let's reinvent the wheel. Let's mix it up a bit and bought in these new rules. And one of the rules that came in was it up a bit and bought in these new rules. And one of the rules that came in was the worst rule by far was in the distance events. They had the elimination rule in the 3,000, 3,000 metres, and the 5,000 metres where they had like the devil take the hindmost rule. And the athlete at the back, when there was 5, 4 and 3 laps to go were basically pantomime hooked off and eliminated. It was absolute carnage. The athletes didn't drop out. One woman carried on running because she didn't know the rules and went and won it. Four guys on one of the laps to go in the 5,000. That immediately says there's a problem with the format, doesn't it? And four of them just dropped out because they didn't know which one it was and Mo Farrell carried on running. It was absolute mayhem. The rules didn't work. They never did it again. It stayed in Portugal where it was being held. And if they bring any of that foolishness back, I'm out. It does sound quite good fun, though, Kath. Mani. I'm going to go, if they try and bring back that Super League nonsense again. Oh, man. Surely not. Honestly, I think even the new Champions League format has kind of shown me that, you know, it just doesn't work. I don't get a feel of like, oh, this is an important group game. Like, it's just too far away. And it pushes the viewer away. I didn't watch or listen to Liverpool, Volonia. I can't remember the last ever did that. Because I was like, it doesn't really matter at this stage. Yeah, yeah. It's a bit weird. It's a bit weird. It's still disconnected. So if they bring that, I'm done. No, no Super League. Thank you. Uh, Ian. I agree with Ronnie I I have a real problem with music in sport all the time now that they'll have music the DJ will be at a cricket ground playing music in between a ball and the in the T20 or the hundred or whatever it is you cannot go to a live sporting event without your in peace leading no you can't but you can't build your own atmosphere because there's some DJ wanderer. I was at the shopput at the Paris Olympics and there's a DJ in between each shot put. What the hell are you doing? What are you, I mean, serious. I love athletics, but the shot put does need a bit of jazzing up. Give myself a quick point there. Sweet Caroline, it has nothing to do with Choppel. You know, and it is, it's like, I can't listen to music anymore. Like, really great songs. Like, like, hey Jude, now for me, it's not about the Beatles. It's about 12 burks dressed as where's Wally at a cricket man. No, I've had no music. Atmospheric, please. I know the DJ who you're talking about, who is in Paris. I'll pass it on. Yeah. He'll be've had no music. Atmosphere, please. I know the DJ who you're talking about who is in Paris. I'll pass it on. Yeah. He'll be thrilled to hear it. Has he got more than three record? Oh, really getting the boot into your mate. Tom. There are some upsides to supporting a football team out of the Premier League. You're delighted to be free of VAR. Once upon a time, you would have been guaranteed decent kickoff times as well. Not so much anymore. to supporting a football team out of the Premier League. You're delighted to be free of VAR. Once upon a time, you would have been guaranteed decent kickoff times as well. Not so much anymore. 1230 kickoffs are ruining my life as a QPR fan. We're the only team in the 92 who haven't had a Saturday 3pm home game so far. Don't expect me to watch QPR at a time before it's socially acceptable to have four pints. I've done it enough. That is what's necessary. And it's really trying my patience. I'm not quite out yet, but it's close. I may revisit my opinion if we can actually win a home game, which we haven't done since April. I was on the train down this morning from Warrington, and at 7 o'clock, there was a lot of Liverpool fans already cracking into the Estrea Dam. It's a great day out, isn't it really? It's a great day out and you're in bed. Yeah. Regular 5-lough breakfast listeners will know that the golden ball in snooker in Saudi had me absolutely raging. That was a thing that thought, I'm out of it. That is it for the first half. I think, I mean, some of the quick look at the scores. Tom and Mani, 17, Ian on 18, Cath on 19. It's a creditable opening half debut from Mani, but let's face it, no Len Shackleton. We'll be back with more fighting talk after the news. Hello, welcome back to Fighting Talk. Welcome back to our panel, Insufferable Villa fan, Kath Mary, sufferable Blackburn fan, Ian Moore, who will be not checking out at Pops' top 10, I don't think, hates music. A man who is comfortably more popular than the rest of us combined, Mani Brown, and the only person I can think of who approves of the way that John Geran spells John Tom Gibbs. Currently in the lead is Kath. That can change, or it might not. Those are quite literally the two options. If you are listening live on a Saturday morning on something that Mandy's grandparents might call the wireless, or you miss the start, you can now go and listen from the beginning on BBC Sounds if you're already doing that. I mean, good luck to you. It is game changer time, and it is about this clip from the My Mates of Footballer podcast on BBC Sounds. That's our contractual two mentions done, when Calvin Phillips told us all about Mystic Pep. The first game we played West Ham away, my first season there, he literally told the team in a meeting two days before how the game was going to play out. He literally were like, West Ham are going to, you know, start well, they're going to put us under pressure. Then we're going to have a little bit of time. We're going to be able to get opportunities to get the ball to Kevin. And then if Kevin plays in behind for a row and then, you know, we're more than like they're going to have a little bit of time, we're going to be at a get opportunities to get the ball to Kevin, and then if Kevin plays in behind for ailing, then, you know, we're more than like they're going to score, or he just mentioned, like, different ways that we could attack, and then how they're going to press us, and then you'd seen it happen in real life, and I was just sat there like, this is ridiculous. Like, I couldn't believe it. I could see exactly what he was saying happening on the pitch. I mean, I think I could have a crack at making a prediction. Harlan's going to score. It would be under a bit of pressure. Then Harland will score it. It would be fine. So, please, gaze into Pep's crystal balls and give me another sporting outcome with pinpoint accuracy. Tom. It's the London NFL game starting this weekend, aka the best time of the year for bearded men carrying a bit of extra timber, still using those vapes that make massive clouds. Not coincidentally, I will be there. Thankfully, my vaping days are behind me, but I've been to a few of these now, and I know my Minnesota Vikings who are facing the jets. They do not thrive when expected to do well. No one thought it would be a good season. But the defence, yes, has been amazing. No. Come on. No. I've got to respect it. You have to respect it. But the defence, yes, has been amazing. No. Come on. No. You have to respect it. The emergency quarterback Sam Darnold has performed way above expectations. Their favourites against the Jets, alarm bells. So I think a reversion to the mean for Darnold against this former team. Annoyingly good performance from a former Packer Aaron Rogers for the Jets and some sort of horrible season-ending injury to at least one of the key Vikings players. Okay, Manny. Prediction, please. Ooh, I'm going to go Everton against Newcastle. I'm going to go 3-1 Newcastle. Everton had their little bounce-back moment, but I think it's going to be short-lived. And I reckon Anthony Gordon is going to go and score against them. Whether he celebrates or not, that's up to him. Yeah, painful stuff. So 3-1 is a nice specific score line. Ian. You're wrong. You're wrong. Okay, notice. I'm going to save you the effort for later. You're wrong. It's going to be a very dull one-all affair. It will rain. Gordon will win seven three kicks. Coleman will be stretched off, get a booked and then stretch it off again. Pickford will shout a lot. Calvert Lewin will miss at least two one-on-ones. Eddie Howe will look surprised to be there. Sean Deish will have rain. That's that shot of him with a floodlight in the background and rain bouncing off his forehead. And in that blue suit he wears. And the viewing figures will go down because Striply will start. That's what's happening later. Some of that was very pep-like in terms of the prediction, Pickford shouting. Calf. I'm aware I've mentioned Villa. Oh, here we go. So it won't be mentioned. The best team in the Midlands are playing Manchester United tomorrow. It's 5th versus 13th, Emery v. 10-Hag. United with two wins, the best team in the Midlands of four. Man United who have scored five goals and the Claritin Blue, mentioned not that word, have 12. And it's going to go like this. We are going to be two-up. Ollie Watkins is going to bang a couple in. And then, once again, like Groundhog Day, our top scorer, John Durand will come on with his super sub cape flapping in the Villa Park breeze and net his sixth goal off the bench. Bruno Fernandez will see a red card for the third time in a row. Fernange. Fernando Fernange. Bruno Fernand will see a red card again for the third time in a row. This one might get turned over like the last one did unsurprisingly. And then Ten Hage will get sacked. So it's a three-nil final result. Yeah. Now, crucially, that is your... That does take you to five mentions of villa. No, it doesn't, because I didn't use the word villa in the whole answer. It doesn't matter. So you lose a point there. I'm not changing the rules like European athletic. I'm not changing the rules. But I'm going to just hook you off. Which is not a euphemism, actually. So everyone calm down. So I've got the Vikings to lose against the Jets. I've got two different predictions on the Newcastle Everton game, 3-1 and 1 all. I've got Manny wanting an apology for me. Absolutely. And I've got a 3-0 prediction for the best team in the middle. Stop mentioning the word. Yeah. It doesn't matter if I do, Kath. I think I'm going to give the, hmm, I'm going to give the points to Tom. But crucially, who are you taking the points from? And I actually don't mind if you want sort of two from CAF3 for me. Like wherever you want the five points from. No, no, no, no. Or from money, like anyone, anyone. Can you do half points? Is that, has that been? So two and a half and a half and a half. No, stop changing the rule. Yeah. Oh, no, no. No. Very much not. The computer program can't hang with half points. Three from CAF. I've never seen Mike look that panicked before. So hang on, what was it? Two. Three from Cath. Three from one from me and one from. That's very nice. Thank you. Yeah. Quite sort of really uneven handed. You know what? Tom's sitting next to me. Look, you're not looking at me now, is he? You're not going to ask. Yes. Very much. I got a slap off her earlier. So be careful. You're a brave man. Right. Next question then. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodall hinted this week that the reason his sport is the best is that they keep adapting the rules. He went on to set. The next change will be to move the kickoff five yards to make it easier to catch and run the ball back for more exciting play. So I want to know what would be your sporting change by distance? Cath. Right. Formula 1. Now, many people like me like to watch the start, the first few corners, and then the final few laps. Yes. And I know a minimum race distance has to be 190 miles unless you're in Monaco. But come on. I'm going to change it. I'm going to shorten it up to one lap. A complete and utter, one lap burn up, no tire changes, no pit stops, less fuel, it's better for the environment. It'll be absolute carnage. I was going to go five, but I thought, nah, that's not enough fun. One lap Formula one racing all day long. One lap and then a lot of padding for the broadcasters. Tom, they did that with the sprint race and it's still not interesting. I was lucky enough to watch the archery in Paris this summer. Any decent music? No, no, actually, it was lovely. It was really relaxing. But they are miles away from that target, which you don't really get on TV. But they're still nailing it most of the time. They still get a 10 or a 9. Well, they are definitely good at it. That's true. Yeah, yeah. They're not there by chance. It is the pinnacle. Yeah. Clearly it needs to be harder, so move it a lot further away or maybe introduce some other Jeopardy. Put a little curve in the course to see how there are. I don't know if you can reverse swing an arrow, but it's probably worth the right. Well, let's find out. Bring in Maid Marion. Just rubbing the arrow on your leg before you. Yeah, Maid Marion can blow in the ear of the arches just before they have a go. Or bring back the child with the apple on its head for an extra element of risk. Yeah, okay. So just, but crucially, making it much further away. Let's start with that. Manning. I hate when I'm watching the tennis and it goes from Deuce to Advantage, back to Deuce, back to advantage. I think there should be a limit and then after that, just start to raise the net a couple of inches. That was okay. Yeah. Nice of it's unreferenced, it just slowly starts moving up as well as ever gets more and more bored. Well, I love that. Ian. This is my second mention of field athletics. I like field athletics, but the hammer throwing record has been the same record for 40 years now, 86 metres and 74 centimeters, held by major Yuri Siddish of the USSR army. So many of these 80s records are just, they're just unstable. Nobody's even come, I think only two people... And no one can really figure out why. No, I know. It's weird, isn't it? It is weird. It is weird. I think just scrap those distances, those records. Just scrap and start again at zero. And the next major event where there is hammer throwing, that winner then becomes the world record holder then, and you start being competitive. Because people are going, young kids going into hammer throwing these days. And there is a lot of them. Loads around my state, right? It's football and then hammer, isn't it? You know what? There's no motivation, because they can't break the world record because they're not... It doesn't have to be the motivation, does it, to break the world record? What, you don't... Because you're going to athletics to break the world record. This is why you failed, Kaff? Mine was 47.6 seconds, which is stupid. And that was a little way off. It wasn't, yeah, it was a little way off. But who held that record then? Marita Koch, I think. East German. East German. At the top of my head. That's my point. It's my point. It's my point. It's my point yeah, it was a little way off. But who held that record then? Marita Koch, I think. East German. East German. At the top of my head. That's my point. It's my point. She still holds the 800 metres record. And can I just quickly tell you that in the year 2000, World Athletics did look at scrapping all world records from prior to certain. They should do it. It's fair to say it kicked off. See, you didn't go for the world record because you weren't motivated. But Jonathan Edwards, understandably, you still holds our men's triple jump. Sort of, hang on. You're not tiring me with a potential. I just had lovely bouncy legs. Yeah, exactly. I'll pass that on. I know the hammer throw are you talking about. I'll pass that one on as well. Who the major? I'm joking. I'm joking. Yeah, we'll exhume him. Most of these athletes are dead because, you know, for whatever reason. And the country doesn't even exist. The country doesn't exist. You can't put the boot into the dead. You can. That's what that's what this show is about. Sorry, I meant you can. I meant you can. All right. Speaking about the NFL, which, to be fair, we do more than this street in Nessa in this show. As I mentioned earlier, and as Tom mentioned earlier, the Minnesota Vikings are in London to host a game at Tottenham Stadium against the New York Jets, trying to bring a bit of that Minneapolis Rasmataz to the UK. The Vikings voted the best pre-game pageantry with the pyrotechnics and the drumming and the fake falling snow and the chance you have scull, scull, and using just about every Viking cliche going except one mercifully. of scol, scol, and using just about every Viking cliche going, except one mercifully. But if Tottenham tomorrow will be the place to be for your pregame show, where has been the most underwhelming sporting welcome you have ever experienced? Mani. I went to a cricket game and I got paid to be. Say no more. You got paid to be there, but it's one of those things. If I just happened to be there, I would have said you could have paid you to be there. Who is paying you? I can't remember. No. But you know, the most exciting thing was that I got told if you collect the plastic cups after, you get a pound. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I didn't know that. And everyone's like, you should go to eat T20 or something like now. Yeah, did you have a good start of cricket? Yeah, I made yeah. And everyone was like, you should go to your T20? I was like now. Yeah, did you have a good start of cricket? Yeah, I made it. Back it. Alright, Ian. It's not just the Olympics I've been to this summer. I went to the Tour de France because it came very close to home this year. Oh, yes. 15 minutes down the road. And the Tour de France, apart from being a really dull life sport, because it's 20 seconds of bloke's just cycling past it. It's incredibly dull. But an hour before the cyclist actually arrive wherever you are, there's what they call the caravan, which is all the sponsors have, like they soup up these cars, so they have their sponsored cars and the energy drinks, we'll have a big can out of the back, they play dreadful music. But what they do also is they throw freebies out and i said it was that the bloke got knocked out by a can of energy drink i got a cut above the eye from a key ring from some insurance company it is just the most bizarre free sport event I've ever seen. You've got, I mean, to be honest, if you're getting hit by Akira, you've got to look a bit lively, right? Have your wits about you. Tom. Look, I know it's come up before this series, but I'd like to give you my eyewitness first person account of Raygun at the women's breaking preliminaries. I'm not an expert in breaking, but I could say, you're not. Believe it or not. I could sense she perhaps wasn't at the standard of her competitors, but I was really ready to love the breaking. I went into it with an open mind. I'd watched some documentaries. It's got a rich cultural history. Like the transfer window, that open mind was slammed shut within minutes of arriving when I realised the whole thing was soundtracked by a hype man called Max from Portugal who was just shouting throughout the entire thing. Ian's worst nightmare. Ian's bristling. Guy's a dress. Yeah, it was the guy. No, Kath knows him. It was basically just the word yo and uh repeating the competitors names like some insulting parody of hip-hop. He said at one point, if you love breaking. That is basically the job of a hype man. Yes, it's true. It's true. I didn't, it wasn't to my tastes. He at one point, if you love breaking... That is basically the job of a hype man. Yes, it's true. It's true. I didn't... It wasn't to my taste. He said, if you love breaking, you will love beautiful musics. I did not love it either. I didn't realize I'm sitting next to two old... These two old men here in the studio today. I mean, use your eyes, Kath. I'm from a daily telegraph. Right, so Ian, Ian, you need to go where I went. So a few years ago, before I retired. You got up out of a seat then. Incredible. You're excited. I was just adjusting my position. I went to the baseball. Oh, my days. This is where you need to go, Ian. Many years ago, I lived in the US when I was still running athletics, and I knew someone that was married to a professional baseball player. Come along, they said, have a good time. They said, there may have been pre-match entertainment, but I can't actually remember because it was so relentlessly boring. It was unbelievable. It was three hours long. What, before, hang on, the match or the pre-match? No, I don't, I don't know. I'd be raising it from my head. You must have known if it was happening. I don't know. Listen, they introduced in 2023 a pitch clock to speed up the pace of the game. That tells you all. You know how much it sped the game up? This pitch clock? 24 minutes. So now you've lost two and three quarter hours of your life rather than three hours. And then when they get to the seventh inning, they have what's called the seventh inning stretch. They pause the game for the spectators to get up and stretch their legs because they've all seized up. They start singing and drag it out even more. Yeah, that is a tacit acknowledgement that everyone is struggling, as opposed. Oh, gosh. Well, I'm sorry it upset you so much, Kath. You can we brought it back to me now. Check in with the scores. Kath, having been heavily penalised by Tom, you are now in last level with Manning on 23. Ian has 24. Tom streets ahead. Curseill that five points on the game's age of age of 29. Five points. And looking, I have to say, very smug about it. All right, let's go on to this. So, a month after getting rid of the lunchboxes, lunchboxes for matchday staff, so Jim Ratcliffe has continued the penny-pinchy at Old Trafford. He's got rid of the club historian, Cliff Butler, 40 years at the club. The kit man was then axed. And then the communications officer John Allen, so he'd been at the club for 25 years. He got sacked, and there's this deliciously awkward photo opportunity. He was given a shirt by Eric Ten Hagg that's got 25 on the back. It is worth a look at the photo because the guy looks absolutely gutted. It's heartbreaking but also funny. Presumably, this shirt was knocked up before the kit man was sacked. This all leads me to ask, what are the biggest wastages in sports? Start with Tom, please. Spraying the champagne at the end of Grand Prix races. Not a good look in a cost of living crisis. And it's not even champagne, which Ian will know has to be produced in the specific region of France. In the plain region. That's top local. Point there for Ian. You don't get that from people who don't live in France. It's an Italian's top local point there for Ian you don't get that from people who don't live in it's an Italian sparkling white from Trento basically they're spraying Prosecco so it's both a waste and not very glamorous in the Middle East where there are many races now it's not even Proseco it's sparkling fruit juice the whole tradition is just so lame it's like oh brilliant we're watching Oscar Piastri pretending he loves the hilarious banter of Charles the Clerk ruining his cat. I found out yesterday as well, they loosen the cork before they give them in the bottle to make it easier for them to spray it. Oh, that's pathetic. That is pathetic. In my new Formula One rule book, there'll be no champagne spraying in my one lap. In my one lap, in my last rule change. So when it's fizzy fruit juice, that is going to be so horrible and sticky as well. That's going to really. None of that. You don so horrible and sticky as well. That's going really... None of that. You don't need that after one lap. Properly annoy me. Cath. Here's a question for you, Rick. How many tennis balls do you think they use at Wimbledon each year? 1,000. No, anyone else? Anyone else? 1,000? No. 12,000, 400. 20. They use... 20 is great. 20,000. No, no, I'll take 20. You've got a point for that. Funny. No, we're reusing that one again. It's knackered. It doesn't matter. Go on. 54,000. Who was closest? I don't know because I don't care. Each is stacked with the year of the tournament. 54,000 balls. At the end of each day, they sell them for a cans of three for two pound 50, and the proceeds do go to the Wimbledham Foundation. That's fine. But 54. You think the charity element is fine. The charity element's fine. But 54,000. I've got tennis balls in my house and gone through five harsh winters in my garden that still bounce perfectly well. And I know I'm not, you know, Navratel over here or Stephie Graff, but flipping heck, 54,000 tennis balls. Do you really need that? And do you know why they change them, obviously? No, stop talking now. They get old and slow like me. Okay, actually, yeah, fine. Thank you. Tom. We are looking, of course, at the biggest wastages in sport. Are we not? We are, yes. Have I not already answered that question? Probably, yeah. That was a waste of time, at the biggest wastage is in sport. Are we not? We are, yes. Have I not already answered that question? Probably, yeah. That was a waste of time, right? Only five minutes ago as well. Is it? Oh dear. Okay, hurry up, hurry up. Okay, okay. Well, I'm going to go, uh, Panini stickers. Because they increase the size of the books and the amount of stickers, and it costs like 800 euros to fill a book now. And that is just, it's a waste of money. It's a waste of trees that go into these sticks. It's not even stickers now, it's max tax. So, you know, the last one I filled was actually the Qatar World Cup because I did a PFA lunch and sponsored by Panini and I knit 10 boxes at the back of the state. Oh, why do you think I live in France, bought your house, did I? Tom, do you want to have one more go at this? I think I'm going to have a point. Mani. I'm going to go with, you see the guy that they always get to take the brunt of a poor var decision. I'm going to go, I think it's so pointless. Like, we all saw the decision was wrong. Why are we spending time watching you come out and say, oh, no, this is why it was wrong. We all saw it. So he must go on and get paid to do that. I think what's the point? It's a horrible job. Waste the time. Horrible job. But they do it badly as well. Right, we are running very short of time. I'm sorry, mainly because I keep asking Tom to repeat his answers. So we'll do a quick, any other business. Starting with Kath. I sometimes come on here and understandably give guys a bit of stick. I hold my hand up. It's all a bit of fun. But now I did it on here and understandably give guys a bit of stick. I hold my hand up. It's all bans. It's all a bit of fun. But now I did it on purpose because I know you hate it. I've never fully appreciated, though, the pain of having to shave your face as a man. Because I had my big 50th birthday last week, and my teenage son is now saying, I notice you've stopped now. Your moustache is rivaling mine. So I use my high street vouchers that I got for my birthday to buy a top lip shaker. What a life. I did. And now it's an absolute pain. So I'm giving a shout out on my end of the business. To all the guys out there who shave and to the middle-aged women, rock on. Is it completely inappropriate for me to have a quick feel of the top lip? No, it's gone. Oh, okay, fine. I've got a bargain at high. Smooth as a baby's boss. Yeah, shout out to all the middle-aged women. Tom. We weren't expecting that today, weren't. No, I, okay, fine. I've got a bargain at high. Smooth as a baby's bottom. Yeah, shout out to all the middle-aged. Tom. We weren't expecting that today, weren't. No, I was not, no. No, I was not. I'm building up to a half marathon. I won't say training. It sounds too grand. I'm using the app of a popular sportswear brand to help me. It involves some speed runs and you have coaching on it, which, let's just say, is not crafted for British sensibility. So I'm basically being told I'm awesome every 30 seconds by people from California. Which we all know isn't true. Yeah, but yeah, the other day towards the end of a particularly punishing interval run, the volume of my running playlist faded and the coach came in and said, you look amazing. I can assure you, I did not to look amazing. If you see someone shambling around the South London Park swearing at at their headphones please give me a wide berth and avert your eyes or simply shout you look amazing manny oh people who don't indicate when driving unacceptable lord help you if this is a bm driver yeah and it's blue awful blue bmws are interesting the main offenders okay um it's very frustrating isn't it? The lack of manners on the road. Ian, I, listen, I'm not bigger myself up here, but there was some charity doings at a local supermarket in France. It's a kind of a food bank kind of thing, and I bought some stuff, and it was for an orphanage, I think it was. And I bought a load of nappies and baby powder and milk and things like that. And I got it on my reward card and they gave me then a load of vouchers, which my wife then picked up next time she went shopping with a reward card. And now she thinks I've got another family. She's got vouchers for nappies and baby milk. It's algorithms. Please leave me out of it. Yeah. And that is Ian's defence and he's sticking to it. Right, let's have a look at the scores. Cath and Manny, tied on 30 points in third. Ian on 32, Tom on 36. Don't you do your accusatory pointing at Tom, Cam. It means Ian and Tom go into the head-to-head, defend the indefensible. It's a ridiculous statement. You have to answer. Doesn't matter how much it hurts. You will not win this by avoiding the crux of what I'm asking you to defend. You have to commit. Tom, you came first, so you will lead us off. You have 20 seconds on the following. I'm so glad that Rick is back as that guy you had on last week was awful and I find his comedy cringeworthy. Absolutely. The thing you've got to remember about Josh Whitcomb is he tried to be a sports journalist. How far did he get really? I think he did an F1 live blog for The Guardian which you can still access online and it says after a crash, there's pieces of car all over the track. An absolute failure of a man. He's had a terrible career one of the biggest names of british comedy year but he trade it more to be watching the break all right ian you have 20 seconds on the following now that ben ainsley has taken gp to the america's cut for the first time in sixty years i hope they i hope they capsize and sink on the following. Now that Ben Ainsley has taken GP to the America's Cup for the first time in 60 years, I hope they capsize and sink on the first day. Genuinely, that would make the sport interesting, I think, if there was an element in the America's Cup where the crews had to fight off shark. Just purely for the blood. And I know that the sponsor of the America's Cup is also working at Manchester United. Presumably he's siphoning funds out of United just to make the America's Cup more interesting. I mean, it's a trick. I really enjoyed both of those two extremely credible efforts. I think I'm going to give it. I'm going to give it to Tom. Well done, Tom. Enjoy a little... Sorry, Josh. Little spring in it. No, he's not sorry. But also Josh isn't listening. The rest of you, better like the next time, with obviously the caveat that after that's showing that simply might not be a next time. Thank you very much for listening. This has been a world's end production for BBC Radio 5 Live. Coming up after the news, it is 5 Live Sports, including Commentary of Man City, Fulham, and presumably updates on Palace Liverpool, which I am running off to right now. And Tim Davy, once again, I hope Palace lose. Hello, you're listening to the podcast extra of Fighting Talk. How's everyone feeling after that? Kath, have you calmed down? I'm robbed. Robbed is the word I'm looking for in terms of me and Tom. Me and Tom have always been cool. But, you know, the maximum points, you know, three points off there. I think if you hadn't had those three points taken off, you would have been in the final cast. No, I'm fully aware of that. It's really done you. I know. I've got a car of alderman brain. I'm good of figures. I don't know if you have got a car of auderman brain, but I can. Can you watch me on countdown? Enough. We've all, we all have been on countdown because Colin would just take everyone for Fighting Talk to do the countdown. We know that. I can't offer any of that, I'm afraid. Mani, did you enjoy your debut? I did enjoy it. I felt a little bit like the new kid being shown around school, showing all the new classes and stuff like that. Have you made any friends? I think they like me. We do, we do, even though he came last. Now, to the Fighting Talk rankings, I'm going to make these We do, we do, even though he came last. Now, to the fighting talk rankings, I'm going to make these quite quick because genuinely, I don't want to miss the football. We've got five rankers, one each. And this, I've got to say, is the one they're all talking about. National Pizza Lovers Day. So I want your go-to pizza. It's pathetic. Your go-to pizza topping. One each each and then we'll deliver the top five, a piping hot. So get the pizza started for me, Kath. It depends on where I get the pizza from. I have different toppings from different places. Fascinating. But if you want me, all right, but if you want me to, he did ask the question, so I'm actually giving you what's called an answer. But if I had to narrow that down, barbecue chicken. Barbecue. See, I've got a nod from Man. That's the second nod of had from Mani today. Barbecue, two nods from Mani. A couple of nods from Mani. Okay. All right, barbecue chicken. Already, I'm not liking this pizza. Tom. Peroni is the greatest pizza topping because it doesn't really exist in any other context. You can miniaturise it and put it in a lunchbox in the 90s but not anymore. Bit of an animal. Yep, yeah quite. You can say that on the podcast. But it's it always improves pizza. Any other topping you can think of has got some alternative application and maybe you could say well it's a bit exclusionist to go for a meat product in this day and age.'ve already got barbecue chicken on there there's perfectly acceptable vegan substitutes now provided you've been vegan for long enough to forget what pepperoni actually made. Uh mani what are you sticking on there for me? Oh spicy minced beef. Oh my god's my husband well done we need to go big pizza man so it's at the minute it's quite the meat feast. We've got barbecue chicken, pepperoni and spicy minced beef. Ian, what are you throwing in him? Well, less is more with pizzas. I don't like too many toppings. I'm lucky. There's too many toppings on this. I'd just go with ham and pineapple. And I'm not being controversial there. Hang on, I only want one. So is it ham or is it pineapple? Well, it seems we've got a surfeit of meat. It'll just be pineapple. This is a rank. Barbecue, chicken, pepperoni, spicy minced beef and pineapple. My husband is spicy beef and pineapple. That's his favourite topping. This is an outrage. And you married the guy? Yeah, 10 years in. I know. What a great topic? What did you have as the wedding there? It can't have been that. Hawaiian. All right. Amazingly, I mean, I'm going to keep what I was going to put on there. And I think it's really what is already a ruined pizza. Antcheviz. Sorry. I like, I like the sort. Don't you. Caff gets a nod. I get the thumbs down from Manny. They give a lovely, slippery, salty tang. Look, it's a hot, look. You've done amazing. You've had a bad day. Remember the top of the show? Yes, I do actually. Yeah. All right, what's, where's my, I can never find this. Here it is. Oh, it's not there. Hang on, hang on. Right, here we go. The five toppings that make up the signature Fighting Talk pizza that is all now available at all goods, pizza chains. Barbecue chicken, pepperoni, spicy minced beef, pineapple and anchovies. And as befits this show, sounds absolutely repellent. Thanks very much everyone. For all things football. Wow, you will not see a better goal. BBC Sounds has got you covered.
