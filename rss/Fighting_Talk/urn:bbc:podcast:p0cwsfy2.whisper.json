This podcast is supported by advertising outside the UK. BBC Sounds, music, radio, podcasts. You drive us wild, we'll drive you crazy. I'm Colin Murray, this is Fighting Talk. This is Our F show of our 20th season. Hopefully you've clicked on to the hidden lyrics quiz at the top of every FFT this season. If not, well, anywho, Mark Chapman's here for a Ful-Def Sport from midday and we'll get you there with the same skull-doggery and tomfoolery that you demand of myself and my four guests every Saturday morning. Wow, first up. Since he was last here, he's added his first Commonwealth gold medal. Less than a week ago, he anchored Great Britain to European gold. But let's not forget the world bronze. That for me was disappointing at part of a much slower quartet. This way. Running, running, running. Seriously, though. Come on! Thank you so much. I appreciate that. I felt so pride, Netany. I felt so pride. It's a personal relationship now, isn't it? So you got an extra oom to cheer for me. So you get back into the airport, you think that people are going to come up and and see the medals and someone comes up to you and says when are my next on fighting talk i was flabbergasted i was like wow i was like i was ready to go into my bag and get the medal and he was like hey man when you're next on fighting for i said i'm on this saturday he's like oh i can't wait to listen i said all right then i appreciate that but and that was in um berlin as well so that means a lot. We're reaching out there. Yeah. It's so good to have Nathaniel Mitchell Blake because we only usually have has been athletes in this show. So it's good to have somebody who's like at the top of their game who comes on, which is good. Usually either pass their best, retired or in a rock band. Anyway, a fifth appearance now for Spurs-loving former fighting talk, intern made good. Like Nathaniel, one of last season's debutants, however, didn't manage to pick up a single world European or Commonwealth medal all summer. The word you're looking for is lazy. However, as she was our intern back, we found the perfect new theme tune for you. Are you ready? It's the clash. Love it. There you go. Kate Macein's here. How you Kate? Oh my goodness. My team making skills were pretty poor, as I'm sure you can all remember. But what I've discovered now is we get stuff bought. We get special ice lattes and the like. So people don't even have to... You get an ice latte, yeah. Oh. Yeah. Your reputation procedure, you know? They're like, get her an ice latte. She. Oh, yeah. Your reputation procedure, you know. They're like, get her an ice latte or she's murdering the office night. Right, 19th appearance. He's a 10-time finalist, three-time winner. But the last of those victories over three years ago, February 2019. He's trading on former glories, which is something this presenter can 100% relate to. He's the big shot sports rider. Tom Kins is here. Hello everybody. All right. Yeah, feeling, feeling good. Congratulations, Nathaniel. Thank you so much. I did get merit in my cycling proficiency when I did that. I love a little silver medal for that. So, you know, keeps driving. Definitely, man. Definitely. Oh, I fancy you today. I think you've a chat. Good chance today. I could get that monkey off your back here, right? February 2019. Right, finally, a 21st show and the most experienced on the panel today for the cricketer, turned cricket commentator, turned frustrated rock star who's playing a gig at the 100 Club, which I'm pretty sure I don't need to mention, because you'd probably plug it as soon as I play this music. So I've got a gig on the 1st of September next Thursday. Anyone who wants to go out. I'm going to do this later on. All right, I'm going to do it later on. But frustrated rock star, yes. Former cricketer, yes. I was so happy, though, that you called me a has-been because I was always considered a never was. So a husband sportsman. I'll bring my medal from 1999 when the Gold Award against Award against Worcestershire, who's watched in front of about 133 people. But still, I've got a medal. Medals a medal. Medals are a medal. Charles Dagnol's here. You'll hear more about that. I get the 100 club a little bit later, but the rest of the show will be good. I promise you. First question, the Wimbledon Spectator who Nick Kerrios accused of being drunk on centre court and putting them off as soon the Aussie tennis player saying he caused a substantial damage and distress. So proper fighting talk question, which sportsperson could you say has done the same to you? Cause you substantial damage and distress. Tom Gibbs. Andreas Muller, less so for scoring the winning penalty against England at Euro 96 because it's character building to lose to Germany now and again at a formative age. But for the celebration afterwards, rubbing a nation's nose in it with this chest pumped out, preening, pompous jerk. I was 12 at the time, a little bit too young for Italian 90, so this was the biggest England game in my lifetime. My dad, so nervous in my living room, he started frantically cleaning the living room during the penalties, trying to enlist me, plump in the pillows. We know what happened. Southgate missed, Mullen scored. And that celebration is where it really all started to go wrong for us as a nation. It was the end of the nearer. Think about the alternate timeline. If he had missed, and we would have gone through to the final. Brit Pop might still be going strong. It wouldn't have been cold play selling out six nights at Wembley last week. It would have been dodgy. Yeah, well, listen, point off for being too long, young for Italian 90. Kit. I don't actually even want to talk about this. I can't believe I didn't just pick somewhere on else. The person I am bringing to the table is Sol Campbell. Yeah. He broke my heart. I was probably about 11 as well. Yeah. He broke my heart. I was probably about 11 as well. He taught me what it meant, what betrayal meant. Yeah. Did he teach you not to trust? Yeah, he taught me not to trust. He's been a formative influence on my life ever since. The idea that somebody could do that to somebody, to people I love so dearly, was painful, was bitter. I know. He became invincible. Yeah, he did. And it was great to see, you know, good to see him win a title at White Hart Lane, obviously. But sadly not for my beloved spurt. He came back and twisted the knife. It's these sports people that think, you know, make these decisions so they can win things. Yeah, exactly. That's not what it's about. So, imagine that. Imagine that. As a competitive sports person wanting to win something. I mean, the mind boggles as to what the mindset must be. Charles. This is from a broadcasting perspective. Now, nothing has caused me as much distress as this at this particular time. Now, it was my debut on live television, my first ever live television commentary in 2017. It was a big deal for me, you know, and any screen time was fantastic, and I was getting all excited. And I was asked to do the post-match presentation. I thought, fantastic, here we go, daggers on screen. This has been panned around the world for the Women's World Cup. I was there to interview the Sri Lankan losing captain, Inoka Ranaweera, my first question. Well Inoka, it didn't go the way that you wanted to in this first. Her response was, please may I speak in Sinhalese. Now what do you do at this moment? I started to sweat. You can't turn around and say, no. You may not speak in your native tongue. So I said yes. She then proceeded to give an answer of two minutes in length where I am nodding and going, yes, yes, absolutely. You don't know what to do when it's... Haven't a clue. She could have been saying that she wanted to overthrow the government. She could have been calling the I see-I-C-I- am sweating profusely, absolutely no idea is what she's saying. Further down the line, they did give her a translator. She then gave an answer in about three minutes worth of answer, where the translator just went, yeah, we played a good game. And I just said, no, she did not say that I've never been as stressed or distressed in my life. Very good. The question is, when did a sports person cause you substantial damage or distress? I have no idea what Nathanians answer could be to this. Let's have it. 2006, Champions League Final. Kate mentioned Sol Campbell. We scored the opening goal in that game. But, Tuhay Haag, the referee of that match in the 18th minute, sent off Jens Lehman, double jeopardy, a red card and a penalty. What broke my heart about this particular situation is, after being interviewed a year later, he went on to say that he should have let the goal stand and allowed the game to be 11 versus 11. Beat Riomaget the Burnabelle, Champions League final, playing Barcelona. They were the team to beat that year, coming back of an invincible season. That's the closest we've ever come to win in the Champions League. Terhe Haag broke my heart. 18th minute sending off our goalkeeper. We won it up at half time. Second half went on to lose 2-1 and we were just flabbergasted and tired, man. But Teuhei Haugges, the fact that he later came out and said that he should never have sent off Jens Lehman. It's like, oh, mate, I was still having a difficult. You never forget the referee's name who broke your heart. It's like your first love. I remember like it was yesterday. The yellow kit, Saul Campbell's headdard. I was like, we're going to I was never forget, you never forget the referee's name who broke your heart. It's like your first love. I remember like it was yesterday. The yellow kit, Saul Campbell's headdard's like, we're going to win, but we're not. Could we didn't. Never. Thank you for delivering that to me. Yeah. I already feel good. I've already feel a lot better. At least Saul Campbell scored. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. You try and move on. You know, like the referee that gives the penalty against Northern Ireland against Switzerland when it hit, obviously Corey Evans back, centre of his back. Hadigan! If you're listening. Let's move on the question too. It comes from you, the listeners. And this week, it's Chris Henderson. How you doing, Chris? I'm good, thanks, Colin. How are you? Good, not too bad, not too bad. Life is all right. Here is your theme, and then we'll explain what it is after we play it. There you go. No, I don't know whether you would have preferred Rage Against the Machine in the 1975 but you're having the 1975 and it connects to your question, Chris. So go ahead. What have you got for the panel? Okay, with the 1975 being brought in to replace Rage Against the Machine at this weekend's Reddingham Leeds Festival, what are some of sports last minute replacements that's left you scratching your head? There you go. Last minute replacements or last second replacements in sport, Netany. We don't have to go too far for this one. I think this is probably one of the craziest and most obscene substitutions that happen in football in history. Carrable cup final last year, Chelsea versus Liverpool. What does Tintfell go and do? He goes on to say that Kepa is a better penalty saver than Mendi. Mendi's been arguably on the best keepers in the last 12 months, winning everything there is to win that's been offered to him. Kepa comes on, doesn't save one penalty, but it's not the penalty that he didn't save. It's a penalty that he took and skied over the bar to miss and hand Liverpool, the Carrabo Cup. That is the most obscene last minute substitution ever. You never bring a player one last minute, cold feet, big occasion. It made no sense and it definitely backfired. Not to mention Kepp was confidence was shot coming into the match. Kepa has a great penalty record, but then, of course, he refused to come off in the other Carverick Cup. So that pressure was there. But if anyone didn't see, because it was a Car by cup final, the Van Dyke penalty in that, where Kepa stands at the near post, and he's like, go on, then go in the other side. And he scores the where Kepa standing. It's unbelievable and just stirs him down. So what greatest penalties you'll ever see? But of course, 11 Liverpool players scored out of 11 against them. And Kippa just skied up over the ball. Yeah, Kelleher scored the winner. Liverpool's keeper. Came down to the Kempers. It the bar. Keller has scored the winner. Leverbos. Came down to the campus. It was bizarre things ever. Tom. QPR in 2012, my team. Yeah, come on, there you go. Question two. I don't believe it was interesting. Took a while. We bought Rob Green to replace Paddy Kenny. You've been really good for us. And this is the period where QPR, one of the richest clubs in the world briefly, spending money like a teenage Euro million's winner. Rob Green was, by all accounts, on a crazy salary for QPR. If you've ever been to Loftus Road, you know this is not a club suited to play in north of 20 grand. To anyone, especially not goalkeeper. Two games into the season, we then signed the actual Brazil goalkeeper, Julio Cesar, from Inter Milan, replacing one extremely well-paid goalkeeper with another on even more money for no reason whatsoever, kept both of them terrific expense. So much like rage against the machine in the 1975, stylistically incomparable from totally different worlds and the replacement much better than who they're stepping in for. Made no difference, of course, QPR relegated in disgrace. Yeah, that is an inexplicable sign in Charles Diagnol. I can trump Nathaniel's ridiculous substitution because there's one even more so. You've got to go back to 1994. Now it's the preseason West Ham are taking on Oxford City in preseason friendly. A couple of lokes, one who's a courier in Milton Keynes. He's on 30 a day. Him and his mate, Chunk, go and watch this game. And they're giving Lee Chapman, the striker for West Ham, an absolute dog's worth of abuse. They're 2-0 up at half time. Lee Chapman's having an absolute shock at Alvin Martin in the side, Joey Beecham in the side as well. Harry Redna, the assistant manager at the time, says, after giving this abuse to Lee Chapman, he takes him off. And he says, Steve Davis, the fan on 30 a day, you're playing the second half. He brought a fan on for the second half of this preseason game for West Ham. But the best bit about it is that in the 71st minute, the fan scored. Bottom right, bearing down on Colin Fleet, the Oxford City goalkeeper. He finds the ball at his feet and he absolutely laces it and he scores in a 4-0 win over Oxford United. So bringing on a fan as a substitute at half time. It's brilliant. Kit. My one works out for the best in the end. But mine and everybody else's head was being scratched, I think. Anyone who was watching the playoff between Australia and Peru when was introduced, the Pink Wiggle. Do you know about the pink wiggle? It's Andrew Redmayne, the goalkeeper who danced his way into the finals of Qatar, into the Qatar World Cup. Oh, yes. He's brought on. He's such as Mattie Ryan, the store, the captain, the goal the goalkeeper the leader he's brought off at the very you know minutes to go it's going to penalties Peru gonna take this on he comes he's dancing he's got have you seen the shimmy do you know this I'm just speaking we don't guys get you do it right now you're you too yeah I'm living it I'm living there he's like limbering up he's dancing so much it feels like he's putting himself off. He doesn't manage to save anything. But he saves the final one. He sends them through. Did he put them off? To me, you did a worm. Yes. You did a worm. That's a worm. That's not a shimmy. This is your shimmy. I didn't. I didn't. That's a worm you did? I didn't invent the name of the pink wiggle. He just normally wears pink in, when he plays in A-League. But don't, don't classify a worm as a shimmy. Do you know what I mean? No, but I'm doing the dance that he does, whether or not I'm categorising it correctly. Right, okay. Right, it's like this. I wish you guys could see this. Oh, that's definitely a, that's more of a whine. It's a wavy wiggles. It would put me off. Can Chris see the dancing? The listener? Chris, did you see that dancing? I guess you can't see it. No, I can't see it. I'll take you word for it. I've really put in a lot of effort here. If you can't see it, then like everybody else listening right now, it was a terrible answer. Let's get the three bonus points. You can go whatever way you want than this. What are you thinking? Well, there was three very good answers and I suppose a good dance. But I'm going to have to go with the Steve Davis answer. Someone who's 35 and still gives me hope. So we'll go for that. Sensational. Well done that. Love it. Chris, you have the best day, mate. Thanks for calling in. Same to yourself. Thank you. I'll do the scores in a bit, but let's get another question out of the way. Sometimes there's spelling mistakes on the, um, on the questions that Simon sends through, and it really annoys me. Um, and today this question came through and the F word came out of my mouth when I was, I was like, sick. And then I realized it wasn't Alexander Usek. It was Alexander Issa. Should have read the rest of the question. It Newcastle United's record sign and it's 16 million. But he's Swedish, so you have to label him the new Ibrahimovic. So who else has been the new someone? And how did that work out for them? I'm looking out for something a bit different. Let's see what we get. Charles Diagnall? Well, I think for about 20 years, there was a search for the new Ian Botham. And that was a tagline on every cricketer. And every cricketer who had that tagline really just did not make the grade. It's not just one player who got that tagline, it's a whole ream of players. So if I go through some of the ones I've written down, Philip DeFratus had that tagline. Chris Lewis, Derek Pringle was the first one, really, David Cable, Dominic Cork, Dermot Reve and Darren Goff, all of whom had this tagline of the new Ian Botham. Only until Andrew Flintov came, did that sort of go away. Who's the new Flintov then became the thing until Ben Stokes? Were you ever the new anybody in any articles when you were young? Like who was the one serious question? Not really. Who's the dodgy, next dodgy medium pacer to come out of Bolton? I thought new Jonathan Agnew, you know? Maybe. Better at common titan than cricket. I'm joking. Maybe. No, I've not been the new anything. I'm just old. Just old now. Just the old this. Kit, what have you got for me? Oh man, this is a bit of a sad one. So Alex Ferguson called Phil Jones, said about Phil Jones, that he could be our best ever player. Bobby Charlton almost, yeah, went one further, nearly calling him the new Duncan Edwards, the Busby Babe, the near perfect footballer. Yeah, he played 162 Premier League minutes last season. I'm going to just quickly fit that story in which I love, which I think it's in George Best autobiography about Duncan Edwards when he was like 17 and their training and Busby made everyone stay by and do half an hour extra on what they needed to work on. So he did some, I can't remember it exactly he said, but he said, right, Bobby, you work on this pass and he goes out. And he can't remember his, it's Bobby Charlton and George Best, George, you work on headers Duncan go get a shower yeah he's a teenager like he says don't go get a shower wow yeah and and that was so Phil James was supposed to be I love that story Nathaniel I'm gonna go back to 2003 the NBA draft now I'm gonna name four names here I'm gonna say LeBron James yeah we got Carmelo Anthony yeah Chris Bosch yeah and to say LeBron James. Yeah. We got Carmelo Anthony. Chris Bosch and Dee Wade. LeBron James was number one. Mello was number three, Chris Bosch number four and Dee Wade number five. Number two, the new Walt Chamberlain coming out of Serbia. Darko Millick. Yeah. Drafted to the Detroit Pistons picked above four certified first round ballot Hall of Famers. Darko Millwich, seven foot two, they say he's got the jump shot, he's three ascender paint, average I think 24 and 10 in the euro only coming out of a college over there and yeah, absolutely bust. He did what two or three seasons even in the NBA? Average I think five point four points, he was a journeyman after that but the fact that he was picked above such great players who were one still in the NBA. And as I said, Chris Wash and D. Wade have got multiple rings between them. Not to mention what LeBron James done. And that's one of the most coveted stories in sports. Because Walt Chamberl, if you guys don't know, the number one's going to NBA history. Big Wilk passed away for various reasons. But, yeah. Wilk distilt. Wilk distil. Yeah. Tom. The best we could aspire to for a long time in British tennis was the wild idea that someday someone would come along and be as good as Tim Henman. And that was the modest hope originally for Andy Murray, that he could be the new Tim Hemman. And it looked on for a while. He kept losing valiantly at Wimbledon. But then he gave us our grand finale. Tennis came home after 77 years of hurt for people who live in Surrey. And we're nearly 10 years on now from that triumph at Wimbledon. The footage still brings a lump to the throat. Kim, looking on in disbelief, Judy sobbing in the stands. Andy speaking afterwards briefly allowed his speech to deviate from its normal monotone. He's now bravely battling on part man, part machine, more than exceeded his billing as the new Tim Henman. Now we need the new Andy Murray, don't we? Right, the scores as they stand at the moment. Love that round. At Kate's got 16, just one point behind. Tom and Nathaniel, who are sitting on 17 points each. But what a difference. A listener, hallelujah, makes Charles Dagnall is in the lead of this fighting talk. So far, long way to go. Butgers is on 19 right let's make this one quick uh the champions league draws been made what is your can't miss game and what one will you probably have a look and see what else is going on uh that night that's the easiest one really isn't it it? There's enough of those about. I can't stand that theme too. Tom. Can't miss Rangers Liverpool, plucky underdogs facing one of the best sides in Europe. Very best of luck to the outsiders Liverpool in that one. And to miss PSG versus UV, maybe in the quarterfinals for that game, but I've got no interest in that as a group stage match. It's a sort of match best left for unimaginative children playing FIFA. Yeah, got you. Charles. I don't care about the Champions League. Miss any of the Champions League games. The Europa League is where if that's where do you get to see random, not well-thought-off teams, happy to be there like FC Sheriff Tirisfol of Moldova or FKuvernaz of Serbia or Arsenal from England. You can watch PFC Ludigretz 1945 versus H.JK. Helsinki. Yeah, listen. Watch that one, boy. Helsinki! Helsinki! Helsinki! Hellsinky! Bring your hard hats! Never heard anyone say Helsinki like that. If you really want to get into the weeds, you're watching that that's not at all. That's the elite you're watching now. Get under the conference league. Of the conference league. Yeah, now you really want to slummit, get into the conference league. We could get a game. Helsinki. Sounds a bit like the guy who did the X Factor. Houdian. Netany, what have you got for me? For the football purist, I feel like Maradona and Croyper looking down on this one, Iax and Napoli. That's the most game watched to me. So much history between those clubs. And the one that I won't be interested in is PSG against Maccabee Haffia. It's been said already that Haffee, one of the players, is requested messy shirt. So they're more focused on switching. He put it on social media. He's more interested in switching jerseys and playing the So we that's the one I'm more to be watching. I like my favourite thing about that was you only said McCabby Hafer twice and mispronounced it twice in two different ways. That's top quality. Always go with Helsinki. I should have gone with the Helsinki. There's a little team just to the west of Helsinki. No more Helsinki. Sorry. Take over the show. Kit. I'm excited to see the champions of Europe head to face Shaktadernetsk in Poland. Of course, they're going to be playing in Lesia Warsaw's ground. So I think that could be quite an emotional moment. I don't know. You know, you wouldn't expect there to be much competition on the night. But I think it's important, you know, especially given Ukraine, didn't end up in the World Cup. I think it's, I think this is a really important moment and outside of football. And I couldn't give a rat's ass about watching by Munich seven Czech champions, Victoria Plutzen, Nill. There you go. I would not be watching that one either. Says the person who watched the playoff between Australia and Peru. Yeah. That's all right, is it? That's all right, is it, Kit. Soccero is qualified for their fifth straight. By the way, the Ukrainian National League returned this week. One game took four and a half hours because of the air raid sirens, off and on, off and on. And the first game back, which everyone's like, the very first game was nil-nill. I love that. Why did we bring it back? That was a stinker. Then another game took four and a half hours. But in principle, that normality of sort of the football being back in the calendar this week. And it was Ukrainian Independence Day, so it coincided with that. You can hear more new stories on Radio 4. But let's get back to this sports show. Final round before halftime. It's the round without a name. It's where you can get something off your chest that's sporting that we haven't covered anywhere else in the show. I'll stick with Kate. Oh, yeah. Well, I'm glad I've got the floor here because I feel like you might be the five, six people in the world. So far. Don't reference Charlie. She's production. Five people. She's my girls. She's my girl. It's even optional whether you're out. It's even optional whether you have to say goodbye to her off air, let alone... Well, I'm glad you said, and I'm talking to her because I'm hoping to recruit her for my cricket team. That is what's been going on. I've started playing cricket and I've told every single person in the whole world of my enthusiasm for cricket. The reason that I'm bringing this up is because I'm sick of people, in particular of women believing that women can't throw. In my cricket team, there's women from the age of 50, right down to 11. You can see it's on a continuum. The girls who've been taught to throw age 11, they can all throw magically enough. The people my sort of age, I'll leave whatever age that is, out of there, they can kind of throw, but they weren't really taught it in school. And then of course the people are, you know, they're having to learn right now. And I spent almost all of last night at dinner trying to persuade my friends that they can throw if someone just taught them. And these are women. They don't believe they can throw. Are you in Charlie? Yeah, I'm in. She's now. She's now, that was an absolute under pressure in. She won't play a single over. I will bet anybody now that Charlie doesn't play a single over at cricket. See you there? Anyway. Oh, what? Tomorrow. I just want it for the record. Kate was the intern, so we have your CV so I know exactly what age yours. Sitting there trying to pretend you're not 26. At Neson-Ey. Well, this is a unique one here, man. I don't think there's much outside of the sporting world. I've been literally been in a bubble for the past three months. So I just appreciate that I have normality about being a fan again because I feel like the pressure's been on me in this entirety. So also being top of the league, I'm going to run with that one. I feel like we're going to win the Premier League. I'm excited to watch football again. I love the fact, like, if I had done what he done in the last month, that would be all my answers so far. And some of the questions were pure set up for him to talk about himself and he hasn't taken one chance yet with it. She's a mark of the man, you know, because I would literally be like everybody else shut up. I did this in the summer. Do you know what I mean? So it's brilliant. But we'll get something out here before the end. Or the podcast extra might be like an interview, right? We just do that. Tom. The Gulf War, Golf with an O. On one side, you've got the lovable nation state upstarts LIV with their radical ideas about no-cut, three-day tournaments, fans invested about prize funds of tens of millions rather than pathetic single-figure millions. On the other side this week, the PGA, not panicking at all, strike back with their plans for Tiger and Rory's virtual reality, techno, speed play extravaganza. The good thing is there's a Netflix documentary come in from the makers of Drive to Survive, which if it's anything like Drive to Survive, will be twice as exciting as the actual sport. And this is the fundamental problem here. It's still just golf. You can't polish it any more than it is. Those greens are not getting any greener. You cannot sex up a sport in which the name for the most exciting thing that can happen is an albatross. Charles. Hot take time and it's my theory that the New Zealand rugby team should now stop doing the hacker. They should stop doing it. The reason was the hacker was this form of dominance, this war dances, tribal dances, like that. And it struck fear into the opposition, right, before the play had even started. Problem is now the All Black's Mystique has gone. They're rubbish. They have literally just been beaten in the last, spoiler alert, half an hour if you were watching it later, sorry. But they've just been beaten by Argentina by 25 points. They're ranked fifth in the world. The All Black's mystique and their hype and their mythology has completely gone. This is a side that had a 76% winning record over their entire lifespan. The All Blacks don't mean success anymore. They mean mediocrity. They mean bang averageness. And rather than do a hacker, they should do a Morris dance or something like that. Good fight. So that is my theory. They mean mediocrity. They mean bang averageness and rather than do a hacker, they should do a Morris dance or something like that. Good fight. So that is my theory. I mean nonsense, but great fight. By the way, Kate just said, oh, I'm starting a cricket team and she went to Charlie before she asked me. I just thought, thanks very much. That's why you were never the next to anybody. At 28 points each for Tom and Charles, Netanyl and Kate on 26. So we only have first and second as it stands at the moment. Maybe instead of the hacker, they can do a Kate Mason Wiggle. Yes. Well, come back to Fight Doggob, Tom Gibbs, Kate Mason, Charles, diagonal and Nathaniel Mitchell Blake with me. I think the podcast Extra is going to be a lot about Nathaniel and has exploits the last month because he's been way too humble. So don't forget you can get that for free from all the usual places. I've had a message from James who says, is Fighting Talk a pre-record this week. Colin seems blissfully unaware of the United Liverpool result from Monday. James, I wish it was, mate. I really wish it was because it's time for the game change here round. Five points for one of you, no points for the other three. It'll make a huge difference this week because it's so close. And we've never asked this in all the time I've been here, surprisingly, because when I first started this, we could have asked it when I first started this show. But the question is dead simple. What's wrong with Liverpool, Charles? Liverpool, to me, were like watching those black stallions run in the Lloyd's advert. Across grounds, they move with grace and poetry, as did Liverpool. Undeniable strength, power and pace, a sight that could make the jaw drop. The mane swishing from side to side as you watch the horses run. The Marnay, main. No longer than that. Thanks for completely taking away the sort of like the idea of my answer there because the main swishing from side. But what if you took that mane away from the horse? Or for Liverpool, that Marnay. Yes, you take the Marnay away from Liverpool, that talismanic figure. He was the one where Liverpool, if it was a nil-nil, about 60 minutes, and Marnay wasn't playing there, would turn to him and end up winning. He was this figure, and then he goes away to buy in Munich. They have a great start of the season. And Liverpool, the life has been sucked out of them. So thank you so much for completely swelling my answer. It's not like you to do an obvious guy, guy. They're I can't believe in. It's very unlike me. Nesseneen. Well, I've done a bit of research on this one. It's called the Klop's seventh season syndrome. Oh, I know. Have you heard about it? So when his seventh season at Mines, they got relegated after getting promoted in his first year. His seventh season in Dortmund after winning the Bundesa's league twice they finished seventh what season is clopping right now yeah seven his seventh season you do that math his rock and roll football has warned the players out they replaced mahony with the uruguayan and bannibal and de carroll darwin neas uh failure to buy a midfielder due to his stubborn nature now this week he said he wants to get a midfielder. They've been trying to get Jude Bellingham. That's not going to work out. Dortmund are not letting him come back. And they're just exhausted. After playing in every possible game last year, they fell to restructure the team. The players are just getting older. They got one of the highest average ages in the Premier League. And quite frankly, it's not working out for them. How amazing does a manager need to be, by the way, that he has a seventh season syndrome? That's unbelievable. it's almost like the biggest compliment you could play a manager most of them have second season said that club he's got a seventh season central six years in off a huge success or it's going to fall a year seven years yeah seven years you just get burnt out joseph really with his seventh week syndrome. Exactly. I'm trying, I think I'm building on this. I'm trying to go a bit niche, because, of course, there are many things we could cover, obviously, injuries, all the serious stuff. But I think what it is, is, remember Glenn Hoddle went behind the scenes, and he wrote a little tell old book, and that shook things up. Yaptam at Manchester United, he talked about behind the scenes, and then they got off to Latzio, I think it was. Petlinda's a number two. It's got a book out, Colin. It's called Intensity. Wow. What a terrible name for a book. And I think he's pricked the intensity bubble at Anfield. Nice. Nice. Tom. The answer is there as clear as day for anyone who watched that Man United game. It's not Marnay. It's not the Anfield. Nice. Nice. Tom. The answer is there, as clear as day, for anyone who watched that Man United game. It's not Marnay. It's not the midfield. It's not even Pep Linder's book. It's their terrible away kit. That hologram, extra sketch, messed. It's supposed to be some sort of tributes of the musical tradition of Liverpool. But let me tell you now, that kit has got nothing whatsoever to do with Rory Storm and the Hurricanes. Liverpool should be ashamed of themselves. There's the stuff i think nathaniel's got a point about clop i think he's returning to what happens towards the end at dormant where it's one good season one not so good making clop a sort of luxury david moyes figure oh right so here's the thing right here's the thing manet and main yeah did you get it that's the thing i almost feel like you are insomnia because if i was to say i actually don't think there's a huge amount wrong it's Just quickly, Manet and Maine. Yeah. Did you get it? That's the thing. I almost feel like... You are insane. Because if I was to say, I actually don't think there's a huge amount wrong. It's three games end of the season. But obviously, Manet... That's what we should have done. We should have sucked up for you. But Manet is the whole... Mani's the hole that needs replaced and hasn't been yet. So I would sort of lean towards you for that and ended up to you. But I just think they might have researched at Ness and Eiff put in. Like, no matter what, the seven-year itch've got i've got a got to give the yeah yeah so i don't yeah nobody knew that and also kate and tom referenced nathaniel's answer and he should have had the worst answer really so we went on a computer and got points okay that's the way we do do this now, far and fair. Read your show. Someone wants to look at your medals. Yeah, exactly. At the very least, Kate. At the very least. Next question, I'm fighting talk about AJ. Anthony, Joshua, not only took the L last weekend, but he grabbed the mic and I get it. You know, I don't have to get punched in the face for 15 rounds. You know what I mean? I don't fight that brutal sport. But anyway, a bit of an erratic post-fight speech from the ring. He later said that when you're angry, you do stupid things. I understand that. When was the last time you did a stupid thing? Angry or not? Nessonil. This was a hard one for me. Being a professional, I have to be myself. I like to think of myself as a cool customer. There's not many stupid things I've done, you see. I mean, I just have to go out. And modest. Yeah, you said I don't talk about myself enough. This is my segue. And after getting five medals, the championship record, a world bronze, Commonwealth gold, what else for the European silver and gold, respectively. I believe it was a pretty good summer for myself and I didn't do many stupid things, capped in the team to the most successful world championship ever, sorry in 10 years at that i'm the best i'm the best fight and talk host in the last 10 years well you know i've only been running for seven so therefore in my tenure of running i think i've done pretty well uh but i guess i was stockholm 2018 went to the race ready to run got into the start line i didn't have my bib in my bag so therefore i had to graffiti my name with my bib and that was me. Nice. That was not what I hoped for. So this is when sport has made me do stupid stuff. Yeah. I was not anger. It was 96. Take you back at Atlanta Olympics. It would have been, I became obsessed. So I was like probably nine, eight or nine. Yeah. I became obsessed with the hurdles yes obsessed I don't know why in particular it's a far ago there you go Colin Jackson was like I think he finished he didn't medal in that in those Olympics but like yeah he on Hemings in the women's 400 meters I don't know I just thought it's the coolest thing anyone's ever done so I go into uh PE lesson I decided I'm going to become a champion hurdler. Yes. Yes, it didn't. I mean, I don't know how that played out in the end, sadly. It was terrible. But yeah, so in we go. And I'm like, looking around, are there any hurdles? Presuming this is quite a specialist bit of kit. And there were. There were two hurdles. But of course, our boring PE teacher was like, you're not allowed to use the hurdles. Like, you know, you don't know how to hurdle. So you're only like, yay, big. So I don't know how you're going to get over these proper hurdles. Anyway, she clears off to go and get her whistle or whatever. I'm like, right, I'm going to set this up. But I haven't been paying attention to the technicalities of the situation. Set the hurdles up backwards. Launch myself at a hurdle. Nose to floor, blood everywhere. I love that. That's great. I love that just a dream you had that lasted one hurdle. Yeah. This is more technical than you can tell. Yeah. Tom. In 2006, I watched all 64 games of the World Cup, which when remembered objectively, was not a clever use of the summer I graduate from university, notwithstanding England's triumphant 1-0 thrashing of Ecuador. The stupidest bit of that was this was a time before second screens became a thing. So for the group stage games, when they kick off at the same time, what we did was we put one big Cathode Ray TV on top of another, and they were the same brand. So if you covered up the remote sensor on one of them with your hands and then pressed the mute button on the remote, what you had was a situation during the game where if you just press mute, the sound would switch between them seamlessly. So I was obviously pretty proud of that. Funnily enough, didn't have a girlfriend at the time. Chos. I'm going to tell you back to when I was a pro cricketer. Yes. And I was quite a placid guy. Did you use something pro cricket? Thank you very much. Yeah, thanks very much for the invite to your team. Anyway, I was quite placid and passive, and I was people pleases. So anything the captain would ask me to do, I would do. You want me to bowl any time. Just loved being a pro sportsman. But there was a time I was captaining, the second team, at a local ground that we were playing. And one thing led to another, and a lot of the young players were giving an attitude and not being proper pro sports. And so I just lost it. I went from Dr. Bruce Banner to the Incredible Hulk in the space of five minutes. I went properly Fergie off on them in the dressing room. The young lads in the dressing room. I got so angry. It was a teacup I threw, or a hairdry that I gave my, I threw my boot into the shower complex, right? Through my boat into the shower complex stormed out and we all came back the next day. What I didn't realize is that boot had dislodged one of the pipes on the shower rail and the whole dressing room had flooded. Oh no. But I just started it! And we took to the field in squelchy shoes. That was enough time to get the rest of the whites driver. Yes. Went to the lost it. Right. I wouldn't say yet it's a race for second place because it's Netanyland. You just never know what's going to happen. But he's on 37. So that's who you're trying to catch. Tom's only three points behind on 34. Kate and Charles have 33. So very, very tight indeed. I wouldn't write Netanylian yet, but it is getting late. So let's find out what happens. Right. Della Ali, off to Bishikis in Turkey from Everton, less than three years since his last England appearance. At one point, one of the first names in the team sheet, 37 caps to his name. It's been a few seasons spent larger in the bench at Whitehart Lane and Goodison. So who in sport has had an even more rapid demise in Della Alley and on Sena. Wish them all the best in Turkey. What are you saying there? Let's go with Diggers. Quick one from me, Sam Aladice. England manager for one game after a long and distinguished career. He went into England management. He won his first game and then caught up with The Sting. My favourite bit of this story is whilst he was being filmed, he was drinking a pint of wine. That was my favourite bit of that particular story. And now the managerial career just went southwards after. Tom. Golf is really terrible for this. You could say Jordan Spiff, but David Duvow is really striking. Perennial top 10 finisher in the majors between 1998 and 2001. World number one, won the Open in 2001. After that, just fell off a cliff. Missed a cut or didn't take part more often than not. Didn't crack a top 10 in a major until 2009. He shot 25 over par at the US Open in 2005. After shooting an 84 in his opening round of the Masters in 2006, his dad suggested he should withdraw from the tournament. Just going from one of the very best in the world to absolutely awful. Yeah, brilliant answer. Kate. Look, lots of people would still be happy to be warming the bench at Southampton. However, do you remember Theo Walcott at 17? Austin Venger handing over millions of pounds for him, playing for England, scoring beautiful goals. He can't get a game right now for a tie that are probably going to be relegated. Sorry, Southampton fans. Netany. I went with a person who's synonymous with falling off for Cliff in sports. At his palm, he was probably the biggest sport star in a sport that's not even highly coveted. Cycling. Lance Armstrong. Yeah, whatever did happen to him. He took drugs. Thanks for clear. Information to Keith. And you can't do that now. It's pretty illegal, but there was a big... Pretty illegal. Not fully illegal. It's just pretty illegal. Disclaim. Disclaim, my ad professional athlete, fully illegal, I don't condone it in the slightest. But literally, he was the face of the sport, had lift strong gear. I wanted the yellow hoodie. Everybody wanted to support the cause, and then he got investigated and, yeah, it's disappeared. Hot Coke cans. Right, still no cease and desist letter from the makers of Mock the Week. So for the fourth week, we steal their round. If this is the answer, what is the question? We're doing it in homage to them, you know they're coming to end of the run and as a as a equally long running panel show you know we're just showing solidarity here you know because we could be next uh so if this is the answer what is the question charles the answer is eight billion dollars eight billion dollars what is the question what is the new energy price cap satire sorry sorry oh it's not the week it's not the week okay okay sporting how much money has jose marino banked for being sacked. Real answer, the value of the Dallas Cowboys announced this week. It's close. You're too much better. Tom, the answer is 13, but what is the question? 13. It is how many times during Manchester United versus Liverpool could you hear inappropriately excited noises in the commentary box from Gary Nell? That probably is accurate. It's the Mount of Games Del Alie played for Everton. Netanil, your answer is 19.95 seconds. 19.95 seconds. That's the answer. What's the question? No, that's very specific. Initially, I read that as 1995. And that's where Michael Jordan came back to the NBA after his baseball sabbatical. And then after deep thought, I was like, that's where Michael Jordan came back to the NBA after his baseball sabbatical and then after deep thought I was like that's how much time Colomari puts him preparing for this radio show 19.95 a lot of work goes into it and it's your personal best is the right answer in the 200 metres right? Hasn't changed in about five years. Kate your answer is 499 to 1 499 to 1. 499 to 1. If that's the answer, what's the question? Chances of Liverpool winning the title. No! I'm going to need you to read me the real answer. So my answer is odds of Emma Raducanu winning the USOP. This year. Oh, this year? This year. Okay, very good. The answer was last year, which is where you confused me, which isn't difficult to confuse me. So that's just what happens. Right, really good questions. My 19.95 seconds of prep didn't leave me to spot that particular clever answer that you did. All right, what's the time? Have we got time for any of these? Yeah, we do. Shall we do this one? Because it's important. We say goodbye to two all-time grits of women's football. Lionesses, Jill Scott, and Ellen White. I've only someone wrote a great column about that. Oh, I did in the Metro. You can read it. Anyway, who are the other Great Scots and Brilliant White? Great Scots and or brilliant whites. Kate Mason. Jimmy Welland-Wites. Of course is the answer. Of course he is. Making his 320 second. Say that quickly. Century is a professional in his... How long is it now? 42 years. Unbelievable. He's been treading those boards. A great Scott or a brilliant white, Tom? Well, it's all very well starring as a athlete, but we know the real heroes in sport are the hardworking journalist. So I will nominate Brough Scott and my fighting talk and telegraph colleague, Jim White. Joe Scott and Alan White, obviously a good summer, but can they give me a tip for Goodwood or deliver an Alleluia Worthy any other business? I don't think so. I'll tell you what, Tom, you were looking good for the final, not anymore. Charles. I'm going with one fictional and one actor, and I'm going with White Goodman from the film Dodgeball, played by Ben Stiller, the captain of the Globo Gym Purple Cobra's. And also, as for Scott Bacula, who featured in two sports films, Necessary Roughness, and also Major League 3. Is he, um, is he? Quantum Leat. He is, isn't he? That's still a good show, that necessarily is like? Is he Quantum Leat? Quantum Leat. He is, isn't he? That's still a good show. That, Nessonle, what are they talking about? Right, and probably Kate as well. Thank you. Thank you. Netanyl, what's your answer? I'm going to go with Alex Scott. Arsenal legend. She's doing a remarkable job in punditry. And as for the White, I'm going to go for Dana White. The founder of the UFC and the fastest growing sport there is in the world right now. Right, let's do the scores. That's where we stand at the moment. Right, Netany will be in the final unless you're, unless you're any other business is. Here's all my kids, because apart from that's a fight and talk thing. I don't have me kids. There you go. Then you're definitely in the final. I have 48 points for you. Cates on 44, Tom and Charger in 43. Oh. Yeah. So used to disappointment that she just assumed. Can't throw you. So you're any other businesses we'll decide. Let's get Nathaniels out of the way because you'd be all right. Go ahead. Once again, it's about myself. Competing at three championships and I was on TV quite a bit this summer. But for some reason, people still mispronounce my name. It's Nathaniel, not Nathaniel. And then what annoys me the most is that when I get interviewed and I say my name when they say, oh, you mean Nathaniel? I'm like, no. Why would you get your own name wrong? Apparently I get my own name wrong. And the thing is, I break it down frenetically. I slow it down and it just gets quite frustrating. It's not the running professionally for the past seven years. Yeah. First, when you come onto the scene, it's like, yeah, Nathaniel, I'm like, you take it after a while. And my mom's like, your name is your name, son. I'm like, all right, mom. Nathaniel's my name. And yeah, that kind of tease me off. Yeah, never ever say, or whatever, you know what I mean? People should pronounce your name right. It's a common journalistic courtesy, isn't it, Tom, you know, to get it right. So, you know, it's like I even double-checked, even though it heard commentators said or crammy said, but it's still double-checking you came on to make sure it was right. It's like the basic courtesy you offer people. Right, Thumb. Yeah, I knew that was coming. Well done. Very well done. I was like Charles, man. I was just going to say, obvious gang coming, yeah. Coming over the hell, worry down. 20 years after failing my driving test twice, I took my driving test this week. Yes, come on, what happened? Well, I'll tell you. I really didn't want to have to retake it because getting a driving test in this country at the moment is harder than getting a PlayStation 5. But I'm really prepared, loads of lessons. Watch a lot of mock exams on YouTube. The best thing I did was listen on the morning to a guided meditation from LeBron James called a champion's mindset. Yeah. LeBron James said it didn't matter whether you were like him prepare for game seven of an NBA final or a trek up a mountain or even a first date he could use his methods for anything he didn't specifically mention doing a driving test in your very late 30s in west wickham i'm sure he meant to uh but look it did the job not my words the words of my examiner. A lovely drive. Zero minor thoughts. Zero minors. I owe it all to LeBron James and minestruck. I love that. That's brilliant. Not just America. A driver too. Come on, Charles. Get the plug out of the way. Okay. If you ever wondered the answer to what's it like for a 46-year-old man with one prosthetic knee and the other one about to go to try and get into spandex and patent knee-high white boots? Then you will find the answer to that question on Thursday as myself and fellow commentator Henry Moran from Test Match Special. We're moving from the commentary box to the stage and we are doing a rock gig in aid of the teenage cancer trust. It's a proper do. We've got proper guests coming. Roger Daltry is going to introduce us. Wow. Mark Butcher is going to come and play. Abbey around from Brent is going to play. Start with them to and then go to Roger Duttery. You've got that the wrong way around. He was your headline announcement there. Yeah. And you don't follow that with the other two. You start, you start. He's going to introduce us. It's going to be a great night. We're raising money for the teenage cancer trust. Tickets are still available. Thursday, the 100 Club in London. Go to we got tickets.com and search for daggers and Henry. I like you all that. And it would be great. I'll be grateful. Because we're cricket commentators and we're not muses. Yeah, that'll be amazing. Kit. Oh my goodness. He's doing something worthy and I'm just bringing my personal worries to the table. Good chance to get to the final. Yeah, so I love my neighbours. That's what I want to tell everyone about. I've got some, I've got great neighbours. They've taken my parcels in. I asked them to water my plants while I was away recently. They did the job. When I had COVID, one of them got the butcher to throw a chicken breast through my windows that had somebody to eat. They're bloody amazing. But normally, don't people like fall out with their neighbours? So I'm starting to wonder, am I the bad neighbour? Or the one they all feel sorry for. Because if you're not the, if you're not the dick in the... Sorry, if you don't know who the... Do you know what? It's been teetering. Yeah, that's that word. Sorry, can you dump me? No, no, we don't have that facility here. Oh, I'm so sorry. Don't worry. You have apologised sincerely so we can move on. What I'll do, though, from that, but you are the weird neighbour. I'll tell you have apologised. I'm really so sorry, listeners. What I'll do, though, what I'll do, though, from that, but you are the weird neighbour, I'll tell you that straight away. What I'll do is take the point off you that would have put you into the final. Oh, no! Because I really, and you're not getting in the final diggers because you're, I was a plug. So you'll stand 47 each. I want to see if LeBron James meditation works in the final. So Tom's there. Hasn't one since 2019 against a guy who hasn't stopped winning all summer. So this is amazing if this works. 20 seconds to defend the indefensible. Let's make it even harder for Tom. You're going to go second. Okay, so Nathaniel, European and Commonwealth champion from this summer. Let's see how you do with this, defend the indefensible. Netany. I, Nathaniel, think it's, defend the indefensible. Netanyne. I, Nathaniel, think it's a joke that they even give silver and bronze medals in the world championships. Losing is losing. Pathetic. If you're not first, you're lost. Who counts second place? Can you really count coming the first loser? There's nothing to celebrate with that award. I mean, what other sport rewards, second and third place? Champions League is either you win or you don't. Cricket, you win or you don't. Second and third place, just the first and second best loser. And I think it's an honorable medal, but no one really frames. It's not to be celebrated at all. If you're first to first. Very good indeed. Very good. Simon Cross, producer, I'm either going to go with the one way of plan, which is the top football one, or do you want an ad-lib driving one? Okay, great. Right, you ready? Yes. I, Tom, should replace Lewis Hamilton in the Formula One as of tomorrow. Absolutely. As the children like to say on social media, that guy is absolutely washed. I nailed my man my maneuver in my driving test this week. Reverse two car links, not a problem. I could do the pit lane, without doubt, I can race you around Monza quicker than you can say. Didn't really make it into the finals of any major championships this summer, but nevertheless, it's my destiny. Oh, it's quite close actually, but there is always a fine line between silver and gold you know what i mean um tom has him on since 2019 and that streak continues netany it's too good too good to defend and some fantastic answers today so you're on this you're on the run of your life son good luck in switzerland i appreciate that of my summer this year this is the most valiant victory i've had i don't get a medal for it but it speaks volumes to a test of a champion i am and thank you colin i will tell you this though there's a little cop outside the studio you need to pee in before we let you go it's a fighting talk podcast extra now charles dangle's had to go because uh he has some cricket commentary to do, so I'm left with Tom and Kate and Nathaniel. Just throwing it out there after Kate's potty mouth this week and let's not forget Natalie Pike's slip of the tongue last week. We've just got to keep an eye here on just the... Is it me? Am I not controlling the guests anymore? Is it... what is it? It's the chicks. We're off the hook. It's the chicks. When's the last time that word was used? Age. What is the last time? So, like, say with Charlie here, and we go back 20 years. Yeah. I would definitely say, how long? 15? Right. Okay. When you were 30 we met. We would have that such a personal relationship that I can be like, all right, love, see you later and you call me that as well, right? So it has to be that good. But do people still use lazy term? Like, would strange men, like say, would still use words like, does anyone said darling or anything like that? Because it was, it's still people daft enough to think they can say that. They're a relative stranger. Yeah, not to let people off, but I think, especially if you work in football, people kind of feel like they know you. So it's more like, oh, what, darling? It's more like, yeah, you're their friend or their daughter or something. Yeah, well, you hope. I don't know. Yeah. Anyway, yeah, sorry again for my party mouth. Yeah. Do I get to come back? Yeah, you get to come back. But as someone who's a broadcaster, I'm surprised you thought the word that rhymes with thick is a lie. Oh, I see what you mean. Do you know what I mean? I don't know whether you thought was allowed. I mean, you'd already warmed up with an arse, right? Yeah. And then she went straight in, so to speak. So look, guys, I had my friend and her kid to stay last night, so I basically haven't been to sleep. Oh, no, it's not much. So, Frank, you're lucky you got any words out of me at all. Yeah. The kid slept, actually. It was her drinking with a mom. Yeah. Right, right. Nathaniel, let's chat about the extraordinary summer. Like, I mean, for me, it was weird to have the Commonwealth's and Europeans. Like, they were literally back to back, right? So, that's craziness and I got a bit of fatigue outside of the British athletes you know in the Euros because there's like how much can you watch what was it like to have to kind of have that carp ADM back to back like that because it must have taken so much idea oh most definitely I mean you train for it and coming into the season I was excited to do it was like oh three championships it's going to be fun it's's going to be lit. And then you're in, I went to America, I think, what, 10 days before I competed. So I was there for about three weeks in total. And then you come back. And then it's not until you get back and you get the email saying you have to report to camp in three days. And then I'm like, wow, I have to go to camp already. So I'm literally, go home, another suitcase. You spend two days at home. And it's that's the hard part. coming home and not resetting. Because you come home and you want to relax, but you can't because you have to go again. So and then after that, obviously, going to Europeans and you're just like mentally spent. But physically you can still do it. What's it like you're young? So you probably don't have as much of the mental pressure maybe of like, because you you're a bit more invincible still so that type of thing of like i haven't seen my partner i haven't seen my family whatever high heart but what's that like when you don't get the mental reset at home and the personal reset of like the nights out and just going and seeing your nan or whatever because you wouldn't have had that right you would have been an ice bath even three days back here you would have still had to keep trade you couldn't have had a stop no there was no time to you stop. I mean, the most you do is you like and training, but everything else is so mentally like tolling and you just have to keep going. Like, well, as I said, the hardest part was going home, seeing a missus and then be like, I'm going again. Like, bye babe. And it's like, that's what gets hard because it's like you want to do something. You want to celebrate the win. So obviously getting a mother that, well something you want to celebrate the win so obviously getting a mother that well you want to celebrate the win but you can't yeah because you have to reset and you go again and as you said i'm still young but that's where the pressure comes in because we have such a short bandwidth like i'm 28 so i'm lucky to go four or five more years so i have to make hey while the sun shining and because i'm in good nick i don't want to waste opportunity and then you're thinking about what other people are doing. They're not partying. They're not celebrating. So you have to just stay disciplined and then go again and then go again. And to your point, World Champs was actually very hard for me as well because I was captain of the team. And I thought that would be a breeze. But then you have to manage personalities and you have to interact with everybody. And you have to be present. And then you have more media obligations. So it's something that I embraced, but it definitely made the job harder. Not harder because I didn't know it didn't enjoy it, but it's an extra title, isn't it? What was your tactics as captain? Because I haven't made that gold run documentary for the BBC. There was a lot of talk about the different captains and, you know, I think Daily Thompson had a fairly hardcore attitude to Lim for Christie. He was like, do you want to turn left and the plane or right? You know, that was he would do it. And then there was people running and saying, I'll show him. I said, was it, Sally Gunnell told me that story about that. Or I think it was Sally Gunnell. But it was definitely, you know, he literally was like, if you get a gold medal, they'll fly you back first class. And that was quite a tough love way of doing it. So what did, not to get too personal about it but like what we I would imagine you're much more of a kind of like tactile arm round the shoulder type of type of cap. To your point that athletics is an individual sport isn't it? It's not football where we're all under field at the same time or basketball, cricket, netball, what have you like each person goes out there and has their own individual job. And it's about managing personalities and understanding who may want to be speaking to or who doesn't want to be left alone. And more than giving a speech, there's not much more you can do because then it comes to the point whereby if I'm competing tomorrow, I have to, like, maintain my energy and control what I can control, which is my performance and protect what I want to do as well. So that was the hardest part is that if someone had a bad performance and you wanted to speak to them, but you're competing tomorrow, it's only so much energy you can expend. So you let them know to know you're present, but then again, they also understand that I have a job to do as well. Yeah, you know, so difficult. It really is exciting. You know, it's been, we pick up medals and track and field, but we haven't had an explosion like this. If you look at what we're like, as male-female middle distance, the 81500 is beyond excitement. And for me, that's always the heartbeat. When we're doing well at 815,000, everything, I don't know why, but everything seems to pull with it and we just seem to really exceed expectations. We're entering, I feel, over the next, well, actually over about the next eight years, I think we're moving in that place where we're going to be competitive at the very front, middle distance running again, which has taken us back to the Colvette days. I'm really excited about British track and field at the moment. Yeah, it's an exciting time. I feel like having a home championship as well, highlighted it also. And I feel like having the camera on us again, and with the cycle being so crazy, next year we've got world champs, and then we've got the Olympics in Paris. And to your point there, we've got medals across the board. And then, as I said on the show earlier, it was our most successful medal hall individually, I think, since 2011 or go back to 2015. And we've got medals across the board from all age groups in all disciplines. And hopefully this can just inspire another generation. As long as you stay on the track, you know, the right track. I mean, you could all end up, you know, opening weather spoons and it goes to your heads. You know what I mean? And Love Island and all. That's still a possibility. Staying on the track as well, very much the first thing I teach you in the, yeah. Yeah, staying on the track. Yeah. I always know when you've got other journalists in the room, they hate it when you're interviewing somebody because like i would ask this i would i've got a silly question you mentioned swapping shirts earlier in the show is swapping bibs a thing oh do you know what we don't really swap bibs although now i think about it might something i do going forward but usually give you bibs to the fans right so like when you're running around, you give your bib to the fan. A little kid wants it. And it's always that first kid who gets it. And then the next person asks for another one. I remember at Commonwealth Games, my bib had my transponder in it, which is basically it tracks your time. And I almost gave it away. So if I've given it away, we've got disqualified. Oh, no. No. No, so kid you not. Luckily, when I was doing my lap of honor, I had a chaperone with me, and so I'm about to take this bib off with the transponder in it. She's like, you can't give it away. The transponders there. I said, oh, sorry. And I was like, to the little kid, my bad, and then you just take a picture with them. But no, we don't really swap bibs. Just, you see each other so much. No, I wouldn't say it's weird, you know. Now I think about it. It might be something I start to do. Everyone was running around with those pins at the Commonwealth game. Yeah, so that's what we do. We're giving pins. What, badgers? Yeah. So, like, it may say England or Great Britain, that's what you do. So when you have your accreditation, obviously it's around your neck. And then people just like literally just lace them with pins from different countries. There's a gold one for the Olympics in Paris, a team G. G.B gold pin pin which you would have already No not for Paris not yet I already have it Oh wow How did you get that? Oh I know people Yeah Do you know what I've got I've got the pin And I've got the official Trachy top as well The Paris? Yeah I've got the training top as well The Paris? The prototype yeah The craziest thing about this, this is not know you're connected. So obviously, Team GB's Olympic sponsor is Adidas. Yeah. I'm sponsored by Adidas. So I was part of the campaign for Tokyo, but obviously it got suspended. So all that stuff came out a year later. The fact that you're privy to that stuff already, it's special. Yeah. Well, that's the thing about the way that, you know, you think about how do you give a team the best chance to succeed. New Year's stories from Nicol Adams talking about coming out of the ring as an amateur British boxer and having to take the bib off as she's going in, the bib off the female competitor in front of her, which is disgusting up to what it is now, which is not only do you have the athletes village, but at Olympics 9, I think it's been from 2012, there's another camp. So you've got two places to go. So it's about that, and all the sponsors that allow that to happen and all of the, there's a lot of people are just, what do you call the opposite? Beneficiary, or benefactors? Beneficiary or benefactors? Whatever, they'll sort of support it. And that's it. I mean, that's the key. Like, you know, it's not a big secret, is it really? You do better if you've got, you know, give the athletes a better chance to concentrate in their sport, you know. It's a funny story on that one there. Sorry to cut you off. Cut away. Cut away. Sorry, no, 2017 World Champs. Obviously, was in London. Yeah. But we camped in Paris. Wow. So we left the country to camp because obviously the media sensation was crazy. It's just to stay focused, really. And when we went to Rio and Bella Horizont, like an hour and a half away. But now, I think Team GB do do a great job of preparing us for this and make sure in the environment that's conducive for doing well. You just want that prototype jacket, don't you? Yeah, and most importantly, they give the prototype jackets to the people who are really mad. Yeah, exactly. Got the pin. Oh, yeah, that'll be worth a few quid. I don't really collect pins, though. It's crazy. I got all the pins in my bags at home. I give them to family, but people always ask them for them. But it's a nice thing to do. The Paras Olympics just finally, I mean, it's 2024. It's 12 years since we had a time zone Olympics. So the last one was London 2012. So even though it is true, London 2012 was great. There was also the fact that you had to stay up the ridiculous times in the last two Olympics in two very different time zones. So this is it. I mean, Paris is going to be amazing in 2024 and hopefully we'll have come through the worst of times as well. And I think, I don't know, we've been saying it since 2019, haven't we? No year can be worse 2020. No year can be worse 2021. No, I'm being serious. No year can be worse 2022. Right? And you're kind of just like, to quote, to quote Kate, and we can, we can bleep it. When are the years going to stop being bids? Could be 2024. Right. Thanks for the chat. We don't usually do that. You know, when we do the podcast Xero, it was really nice to sort of talk properly to, I don't know how to pronounce his name. We haven't bothered to learn. Right, we'll see you next week. Not many people are. Bye. Thank you guys. Box at your evening with BBC Eye player. I'm the witch finder. You know, they said a witch finder was coming.
