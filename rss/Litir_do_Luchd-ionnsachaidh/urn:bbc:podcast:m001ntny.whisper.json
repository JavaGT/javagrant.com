Ageny's not one of Enoch in Jue, he hath three foeweecky, that the co-chion of the Aramach in the Seimassach on in aught of line Gyeok. on the co-heal of Aramach in the Seymusach, on the 8th line 2.

Aungan d'arne illimates, it's oehmachug as V. But, if I know in ruckus that in co-g's W the hear of the Natche V in the name. And then, that is the W in the following, the W, a fall of the Learland Narsenton to the Halloppa and he had a haring rickle, garr, choulet. but in a harang greekela, gyrritsch in J. Blar Chulotter. I, that's a question erichorachach with ename in the script C-U-L-R-A-I-C-K Coul-R-R-R-E-E-O-R-G, Tullug, my Wack-E, but I'm much as Kiel-raig, my Goulde. Tullug my wife that's a minute or the Gah. But beckan my chastiel in that's the hugh drudjach hath two o'er O'erlor of the one, he lehach shliah at the chastel Chutrimach Ile Ile Lachach Cross, Cassel,allackan Ross, Dall Cross Castle, and Castell Chalattar, Codercasel. He's a chalachal, Stoie, in Molloch, Druma, that you're at Ushanaran. He's an oirach gama torach with mesquage of, parkin, and collie o'er. The the irauch, Gimathorach with the Miskakian, Parkin and Culli-Ora and the castle the Hesu to the Furoacham but he'll iras that heirs in six in shesquat Gah Gahorich there was in the Lavan Aun-elich, fat the Hunscian, or Roses. Gassal Chilraig, Ruttick, Rottik, Rottik, Ruhnach in the Cochell on, and he a harangri-heelae, garred in the Shiae, in a few years of Chieuil. There Makhjoonlai is Makhine Lai, but there no other than it was a smoenuching not a few of the Wissue of the Vapu in the Ereast Cahe Carson a carstel Chilraig chutermuch on in this Garnach Well, there is a Chalctin in the Vapap the name the name and aughtal Eymel Eumuch in Yoncey in your Naren. That's far an hour Aramatch Vour in Realtish, a cawapuch. There are no shameasic at all the host Yungiore, but stattat, Mustoranikat in your Naren, and hileathe. Hulotter, ha, Gleor, in the Vech that the kashmach eich in that the Chalathe, and kowlotter. And catch in the hunday, jirach, good- Gautau in the castle Kielraig. When you're young, it feels like anything is possible. Maybe you're a little hot-headed, but your optimism lifts you up. And your righteous fury can be rocket fuel, propelling you to fight for what's right. You might make choices that put you in danger. You might even make history. I'm Nicola Cochlin. This is history's youngest heroes. Rebellion, risk and the radical power of youth. Being young, maybe she didn't think too much. She thought, right, I'll just do it. She thought about others rather than herself. Twelve stories of extraordinary young people from across history. There's a real sense of urgency in them. That resistance has to be mounted. It has to be mounted now. Including a young man called Nelson Mandela, a firebrand who led the defiance campaign against apartheid. Break segregation laws, ignore curfews, enter the door for white people at the post office, stand on the white side of the platform at the train station, and it's decided that black people are going to do this en masse. And Lakshmi Bai, the Rani of Jansi, India's warrior queen. She was a small woman leading her troops, a stride a horse, sword in each hand, taking on the might of the entire British Empire. History is lit up by young people who act on instinct and stick to their principles. Like Julian of Narich, one of the first women to write in the English language, a trailblazer, but at a cost. Why would somebody choose to have themselves blocked up into a tiny little cell with limited contact with the outside world out of choice? And Lady Jane Grey, Queen for nine days, who refused to give up her faith and chose to face the executioner's axe. You have someone who is knowingly risking death and then ultimately knowingly taking death because there is something that matters more to them than their life itself and that's a fundamentally heroic position. These are tales of saints, athletes, Hollywood superstars and pioneers. Some heroes are household names. Some have been all but forgotten. Like Fasili Arkipov, a Soviet naval officer whose extraordinary courage helped save the world from nuclear catastrophe. Well, sticking to your guns on that submarine in that heat, that take gods. That really takes gods. History. Made by young people. Follow history's youngest heroes wherever you get your podcasts. Thank you."}
