This Leicester Dolokhjumseh for BBC Radio Nengale. This is Leicester Dolok Guenshachie from BBC Radio Nengale. This is Lichtenz, from BBC Radio Nongale. Now is Leicester Dollyngucush, Learer Makhielan. This is Leicester, 6.2. In Chalkin, in two, I can't give to Vannish to Alastair E. R.N. Hullop. On the 2.2, J ago, it's two years ago. It was Enric the three re-hassin, and the few times, and the way of course, in the real life, and it was for Hanish-htchak, or Kaurla Rieli. When Alastair Keehik, then hewere Gieh, then you on the Chorla, and it was a sassah in aric. It would the other than six years, that was Alastairister the ineufach to use Blenarichet. If you're a new shing that's Alistair and Aven Mairat on Tours A Haasin on the Chourst Riegel. I've Corme Cooch Tull to the Parentan the Rie and a van Rie, on the Mwinser. There Maird in doubt Lennu, was to the Gaki Alapah. Scrive Enric Lichar, that Alistair, Agealton, Gimbegulah, and the name, Sour, Sour, Agahe, in Jey in Tourish. and the name Sour Aghaugh in Jai in Tourish. Inum Faye Alastar Paz, there's the Lennu Sour, a loggolpah. Gull of Alastair Gah, the Farkal Avra of Nam Winser. Rooka Lenu Niena in that in the Ochk of Laph Fichet in Yarran, two-year-jew, six at one, churrug mairot o'er, as I'menem. When the Rannick Alastair ewee hushed-de, gunroa, d'all elenton to the Opper Aher on if it was the tors nor nilan-shir-e for smack-coast- Riegel, the Hallaba. In the Owe, was Rye Nerevee, Hocken the Chir, and there was, in the hill in the shir in a chumel for a smack heine, and there are the other one other, on the chown in the Kahn in year hua in the hallab. There harkon of the ryearn a bookchiky, that was Ruehivy. It was in the Rye Chahar on the chorus of four years. It was a call-mour, cooch-chok-eck-e. It's elledach in the FAP and on Empura new the Roaia, and farak in Rearne as Cannerson at the Foggiae but Charrou Alastair Gahn Duffin'an Choude Fiske that O'Conn to Gere in Hullapah and he fa'amach Rie the Hallap a gier in Ellingen to the Chir Nalapa and it was for smack Rie Nahlopoe Yulat Jules Hocken the Tackrug Huck Irle Rosh Iuance Aunuch Aunson Yelans Schianach There a cupber with Rie Alaster and Iarish Muncho Rookon O'Nbergen in the R. Alastair, and I aris, the other than Chouacan on the Bergen. There's few other a cooper in the Neregal Coutch. Iach Enric Rie Hassin Rish the hush the Hove the heart Gourietha Scrive that Hockon and Alistad a-e a-go co-cug- co-cug- Gaut. Gatah he's a-o-a-o--attah. Not that Aalapa the Tosan to Nirvi at a om, when it was the Rihach-Loch-Lach in a-Earch a-o-o-ach, but was Alastair at the Toulin Perciente, to Hocken Kutjark. Gorsdy Hocken to be a calloch, more, coaxach, in the chur-richela on the yuncea on the whole-oppa. to hearst in Kaulich Nallapa. Harish, in the younger, on the 2nd 6.2 and 6.3, and the Caulich Lachlanach of Chur Rihela. It would the conchon to Caulach Nalapa the town Grown Viersen, fast, in the Lerickie Gaulta. When you're young, it feels like anything is possible. Maybe you're a little hot-headed, but your optimism lifts you up. And your righteous fury can be rocket fuel, propelling you to fight for what's right. You might make choices that put you in danger. You might even make history. I'm Nicola Cochlin. This is history's youngest heroes. Rebellion, risk and the radical power of youth. Being young, maybe she didn't think too much. She thought, right, I'll just do it. She thought about others rather than herself. Twelve stories of extraordinary young people from across history. There's a real sense of urgency in them. That resistance has to be mounted. It has to be mounted now. Including a young man called Nelson Mandela, a firebrand who led the defiance campaign against apartheid. Break segregation laws, ignore curfews, enter the door for white people at the post office, stand on the white side of the platform at the train station, and it's decided that black people are going to do this en masse. And Lakshmi Bai, the Rani of Jansi, India's warrior queen. She was a small woman leading her troops, a stride a horse, sword in each hand, taking on the might of the entire British Empire. History is lit up by young people who act on instinct and stick to their principles. Like Julian of Narich, one of the first women to write in the English language, a trailblazer, but at a cost. Why would somebody choose to have themselves blocked up into a tiny little cell with limited contact with the outside world out of choice? And Lady Jane Grey, Queen for nine days, who refused to give up her faith and chose to face the executioner's axe. You have someone who is knowingly risking death and then ultimately knowingly taking death because there is something that matters more to them than their life itself and that's a fundamentally heroic position. These are tales of saints, athletes, Hollywood superstars and pioneers. Some heroes are household names. Some have been all but forgotten. Like Fasili Arkipov, a Soviet naval officer whose extraordinary courage helped save the world from nuclear catastrophe. Well, sticking to your guns on that submarine in that heat, that take gods. That really takes gods. History. Made by young people. Follow history's youngest heroes wherever you get your podcasts. Thank you."}
