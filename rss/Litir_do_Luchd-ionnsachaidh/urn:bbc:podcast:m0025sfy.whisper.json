In this new series, we're confronting the dark side of the wellness industry where the hope of a spiritual breakthrough gives way to disturbing accusations.

I wanted to believe that, you know, that whatever they were doing, even if it seemed gross to me, was for some spiritual reason that I couldn't you understand. Revealing the hidden secrets of a global yoga network. I feel that I have no other choice. The only thing I can do is to speak about this and to put my reputation and everything else on the line.
