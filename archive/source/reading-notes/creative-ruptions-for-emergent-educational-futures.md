# Purpose
At the heart of this book is a desire to spotlight **creative approaches within education** which not only ethically facilitate generative practices, but **which can be catalysed to instigate ruptions and change within educational systems**.

**Our intention** in opening the book by detailing the challenges **is not intended to weigh you down with the enormity** and impossibility of it all, but rather the oppositeâ€”**to acknowledge that if we look carefully and responsively, we can identify problems that have emerged in the early twenty-first century within which educational systems are contextualised**, and to which we, as an authoring team, believe we should aim to respond as educators.

As editors we are also clear that we want to offer direct educational responses. Much of the work in this book stems from **complex philosophical thinking which can have a reputation for being disconnected from practice and not applicable in action**. We aim to balance the richness of the philosophical heritage of our ideas with a translation of that thinking into practice-based action and provocations for change. This book follows in the footsteps of our teamâ€™s previous writing partnerships (e.g. Chappell, Rolfe, et al., [2011](https://oro.open.ac.uk/37497/)), **where the authors argued against the limited official future for education offered by neoliberal policymakers**. Rather than curtail education to probable futures, similar to the status quo and which fail to deal with the challenges we are facing, **this book is arguing for a diversity of radical alternatives**, indeed **in line with Fielding and Moss ([2010](https://doi.org/10.4324/9780203837405)), we propose an ethos of overthrowing the current dictatorship of no alternatives**.

If the book is then aiming to share and articulate alternative, emergent new approaches to education, **what are the challenges that these alternatives are working to address? Chappell (2021) has previously articulated anthropocentric issues as broadly as political violence (Khalili, 2013), democratic subversion (Piccone, [2018](https://sur.conectas.org/en/democracy-and-digital-technology/)), the slouching beast of neoliberalism (Ball, 2016), the climate emergency (Leichenko & Oâ€™Brien, [2020](https://doi.org/10.1177/1478210316664259)) and global disease caused by overpopulation (Grange et al., 2021)**. This array of emergencies can be seen to sit within **Lopez-Claros et al.â€™s (2020) detailing of twenty-first-century challenges including those derived within environmental, social, economic and security issues, which they argue are compounded by the inadequacy of the governance mechanisms that exist to deal with them**. Segueing with this, **the [University of Lincolnâ€™s twenty-first Century Lab](https://21stcenturylab.lincoln.ac.uk/) has identified ten grand challenges for this century: increasing inequality of wealth and income; migration and mobility; living in a global society; conflict and war; void of vision and foresight; identities and changing norms in society; mitigating environmental and ecological damage; changing economic powers; technological disruption and civic disaffection**. The Lincoln teamâ€™s intent is to understand the new roles and relationships that higher education might need to enter into in this context. For our purposes in this book, **challenge frameworks like this are helpful to provide context for our discussions**. We are not, of course, suggesting that an early years classroom in Italy or a Kenyan secondary school or a US community arts education initiative can solve these challenges; our purpose here is to ask you to **turn your educational efforts more firmly to face these identifiable challenges and to address your teaching, facilitating, curriculum and classroom design, policy influencing and studio research towards thinking and acting creatively**, using the provocations in this book to generate more relevantly responsive emergent educational futures.
