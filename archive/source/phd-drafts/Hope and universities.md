Read the Universities and Hope section first, use the Hope section as supplimental (the structure should revolve around the relationship and applicability of Hope to Universities foremost).
# Hope
## Understanding Hope
What is more important about hope is this sort of generalised
state of being, which is an alluring state where you hope and you work and you
dream and you yearn and you live in these states simultaneously, and these
layers of feeling and energy and labour are so tightly linked that it is often
difficult to distinguish them. p. 82 [Hope: new philosophies for change Mary Zournazi 2002]
- To me, ‘hope’ is about a certain generosity and gratefulness that we all need in life. If life is a series of encounters and chance meetings, events and social relations, then hope lies across all of these. p14[Hope: new philosophies for change Mary Zournazi 2002]
- Hope can be what **sustains life in the face of despair**, and yet it is not simply the desire for things to come, or the betterment of life. It is **the drive or energy that embeds us in the world – in the ecology of life, ethics and politics**. But it is also to do with **power relations – the economic aspirations of what life is ‘meant to be’**. p14[Hope: new philosophies for change Mary Zournazi 2002]
- Hope is built on belief and faith, and **the trust that there is a life worth living in uncertain times**. Without this kind of hope there is a denial of difference and newness, meaning that **nothing is possible in personal or political terms**. **Without hope what is left is death** p.16[Hope: new philosophies for change Mary Zournazi 2002]
- we need to re-envisage and imagine **hope as a convergence of new agendas, conversations and possibilities in everyday life and political activity**. The hope investigated here could shed light on the false hopes and promises that have been sustained over the last several years. **It provides a framework to think about ‘progressive’ politics**. p.17[Hope: new philosophies for change Mary Zournazi 2002]
- here is a difference between simple expectation and hope. One could say ‘because I see this is the way things are going, this is the way things have developed, I expect this to happen’; expectation is based on the pattern you see in the past. But I think **hope is always hope against the evidence**. I hope she will fall in love with me – **there isn’t adequate evidence for that. So there is a kind of discontinuity in time, there is a break, and something starts out of nowhere**. If you begin to hope you’ll get well after this disastrous illness, or that your father will overcome this cancer, you really don’t understand where this hope comes from; it just comes. I am always struck with those people who have great hopes and who are in fact no better endowed than anyone else – they are not more beautiful or more gifted or more intelligent or more healthy or more strong. So hope doesn’t come out of those things. p.23[Hope: new philosophies for change Mary Zournazi 2002]
- **The role of compassionate hope in a globalised world**
- hope cannot be separated from how national debates are framed and from the reality of living in a globalised world. But **community insecurity needs to be explored through individual experience as well as national debates**. p.16[Hope: new philosophies for change Mary Zournazi 2002]
- It is easy to take a moral stand and to blame others for their unwillingness to engage in dialogue. But **we have to move beyond a politics of blame to one of compassion** – a political **activity that gives us hope and understands how hope and despair emerge in contemporary life, because when people have no hope to give they also have little space to reflect and engage with others**. p.16[Hope: new philosophies for change Mary Zournazi 2002]
**Hope and spirit**
- Now hope: if we started off this conversation with ‘Where is hope?’ ‘What status are we going to give it?’ ‘Is it rational or irrational?’ ‘What’s its role in the every day?’ ‘Is it a faculty?’ and so forth... **perhaps thinking about hope in terms of spirit possession would be a shoe-horn into thinking about hope and healing, hope and miracle, or hope and metamorphosis.** As I understand it, spirit possession often implies being possessed with the power of grace, the transformation of a bad situation into a good situation. It might be interesting to contemplate a place of hope in this in-between consciousness... [...] the ‘**spirit possession’ in the capitalist world we live in has been filled by certain kinds of fetishisations** around commodities, or spiritual meanings get filled up with material worth or whatever. So **the spirit seems to be filled by some relationship to money, power or objects, and reality is there to be consumed** (which is obvious in the media and the representation of politics). p.55[Hope: new philosophies for change Mary Zournazi 2002]

## Useful Hope
**Hope for reconciliation**
- And, in Australia, the indigenous politics – I mean **there has to be hope there for some form of reconciliation**. It’s important not to deny the past and the suffering because that’s lived – the memory of that is lived in the very body of people. But I suppose **without hopefulness you couldn’t come and meet at the table**, so to speak. The problem is when the other party doesn’t want to hear what you are saying, which is then a denial or taking away of hope... p.40[Hope: new philosophies for change Mary Zournazi 2002]

## Critical Hope

**Individualisation vs hope**
- consider where hope may lie in social terms, and to reflect on **the disconnectedness felt in life and labour**. It brought home the real feelings of hopelessness and despair in our identities, in our sense of being in the world. **Where is hope when compassion, empathy and dignity are synonymous with self- gratification** – getting what you want at the expense of others, whether in the workplace, in our relationships or ‘across the board’? p14[Hope: new philosophies for change Mary Zournazi 2002]
- in western cultures, **hope is closely tied to the material definitions of living,** and in these times **capitalist economies link our cultural senses and dreams to economic imperatives of the self**? ‘**The American dream’ is often cited as the promise and aspiration of a free-market economy**. So, if these hopes and dreams can be the vehicle of the free market and culture, what gambling does this involve? **It could be linked to envy and resentment, which in political terms leaves very little room to move**. p.42[Hope: new philosophies for change Mary Zournazi 2002]
**Bad hope, founded in fear, leads to violence towards other**
- In **late capitalism**, our humanness is closely tied to **economic definitions of the self**, and notions of security and comfort. The **search for happiness becomes** a search for emotional security **based on economic success**, and our personal dreams are part of the drive to get more out of life – more success, more money, more hope. But **instability** at work, at home and in our social relations **makes these visions of happiness an imagined reality**, both individually and nationally. With this comes an increased sense of frustration and insecurity, where **feeling ‘at home’ requires protection against anyone who threatens our comfort**. For instance, foreigners may be seen as threatening to us, and to our national security and comfort. p15[Hope: new philosophies for change Mary Zournazi 2002]
- This is a symptom of the **increasing disparities between rich and poor** that are produced through national and global economies. The population becomes **disenfranchised**, giving rise to class divisions, ethnic tensions and poverty. These social conditions produce feelings of **despair and anger**, and those who feel bereft may call upon the last bastion of dignity – their identity. At the same time the major political parties, and **democratic politics in general, are failing to provide other possibilities for hope based on compassion, sensitivity and care**. p.16[Hope: new philosophies for change Mary Zournazi 2002]
- The success of **right-wing governments** and sentiments lies in **reworking hope in a negative frame**. Hope masquerades as a vision, where the passion and insecurity felt by people become part of a call for national unity and identity, part of a community sentiment and future ideal of what we imagine ourselves to be. **It is a kind of future nostalgia, a ‘fantastic hope’ for national unity charged by a static vision of life and the exclusion of difference**. p15[Hope: new philosophies for change Mary Zournazi 2002]
- When, **for the benefit of our security and belonging, we evoke a hope that ignores the suffering of others**, we can only **create a hope based on fear**. This hope lies in the heart of terror, where **violence is enacted** in literal and figurative ways. p15[Hope: new philosophies for change Mary Zournazi 2002]
- **Hospitality towards other people** then **becomes conditional** and, more often than not, **hostile and unforgiving**. p15[Hope: new philosophies for change Mary Zournazi 2002]
- **When public sentiment is fuelled by insecurity, the risks we take with each other, and the potential for public debate, are diminished**. p15[Hope: new philosophies for change Mary Zournazi 2002]
- **there is danger in ratifying systems of thinking and belief – where hope becomes polarised into political terms and rhetoric**. p17[Hope: new philosophies for change Mary Zournazi 2002]
- I believe a hopeful project for these times is to reflect upon and **challenge the way ‘progress’ and new forms of capitalism lead to false visions of the world**. Without a deeper understanding of its meaning, hope can only masquerade as some essential truth for capitalism. For me this involves revisiting some basic tenets of socialist and Marxist ideas of social relations – **what it means to be human, our relations to labour, and the alienation experienced in class and social stratification**. p.18[Hope: new philosophies for change Mary Zournazi 2002]
**Hope and the market**
- think about how much of **the market and market entrepreneurial activity is dependent upon hope, not revolution**. Let’s change the topic: let’s not talk about the relationship of revolution to hope, let’s talk about the **everyday dependence on hope in keeping the market active**, whether it’s buying or selling stock – and there we **enter into the world of the gambler, which presumably hope is exquisitely addressed to**. And perhaps there must be a great deal of optimism and hope necessary in the more generalised behaviour of whatever it is that makes entrepreneurs entrepreneurial. p.56[Hope: new philosophies for change Mary Zournazi 2002]

**How our position influences hope**
- But I have been very struck by that in terms of, say, **academia and other walks of middle-class life, where people I see are completely unable to relate to that aspect of their being with other people**. And it doesn’t mean giving beggars in the street a dollar instead of 10 cents, or a dollar instead of nothing. **It seems to me it is a way of life, or generates a way of life, which is a completely different calculus of hope**. So let me try and put it this way – there is the hope of the person who works as the news photographer or the TV photographer, who is meant to capture the minds or the eye of millions, right? – the BBC and CBS and all this sort of stuff. And **what does it mean to shrink from that world of the international media to working four blocks around from your house and in this, one might think, hopeless way** – these totally destroyed kids of whom there are so many – and, you know, night after night go out and do this thing with the age difference, the colour difference, the class difference. But, **at the same time, getting to know everyone by their first name, and all the jocularity in getting to know each other and building up a sense of what it is to have another type of community. Let’s say that this is an ‘island of hope’,** and it’s totally unconventional, I think. There, obviously, **the world has to be composed of these islands of hope. This is not the missionary, this is not the Mother Teresa type of thing, this is ad hoc and done in the terms of a personal style that I find one of the few convincing – how shall I put it? – politics of hope that I have seen in a long time.** Another rather different example of this would be the highly spirited, much more collective operation of the Zapatistas in the south of Mexico. And why do I bring hope in there? I bring it in because of the humour, poetry, writings and emails of Subcomandante Marcos and his mischievous, original wordplay which take the notion of revolution and carnival back to their real meaning. That degree of spirit combined with the sort of physical daring of taking on the Mexican state and combining violence with wit – very minimal violence, I must say – there’s an astonishing politics of hope. This is quite different to the first example I gave of a solitary individual, the photographer, which to me is a fascinating and amazing image. But **if you took those two examples – and one can come up now with many more, because I think I have opened up a gate to the imagination – you could extend the possibilities of the politics of early twenty-first century hope**. p.62[Hope: new philosophies for change Mary Zournazi 2002]

Leila Dawney (2017)
- The essays explore the nuanced role of hope in relation to power and its impact on efforts to enhance lives and create a more just future. The authors utilize a multidisciplinary approach to showcase how hope can influence writing and politics in a post-hopeful age.
## Strategies for hope
My
ideas on turbulence focus on more aggressive and more challenging forms
of disruption. So what I try to do is think about energy as a field and as
a particular force. And to think about how through that combination of
disruptive pushes and shoves and pulls there is a certain pattern that forms
which is always changing, and as a consequence of being changed, new
elements come into play. Taking into account your idea, when an aeroplane
goes into a turbulent field it isn’t just rocked around by that turbulent field
and the air pressures, but its presence in that sphere actually distracts,
diverts, diffracts, etc, the flows of energies around it. It too is changed – it
goes off course but it also changes, whether in significant or insignificant
ways, the actual forces that it is interacting with. So, in a way, I wanted
a metaphor about the complexity of energy levels of the modern world
– intellectual, social, economic, political, and also one that gives credit to
the agency of individuals. p.86[Hope: new philosophies for change Mary Zournazi 2002]


I want to go to back to the relationship between perception and experience,
and how language has a relationship there – for instance, the way
perception and experience is expressed through language, or how writing
can enable experiences that have been silenced to take some form. I see
language and imagination as a critical element in expressing hope, or the
possibility of changing entrenched modes of thought... 
Tell me a little bit more about how you think about hope and its expression
and its relationship to language.
Well I think there has to be, in order to exist at a certain level, the possibility
of being able to communicate in language – so words have that basic
element of being hopeful, of being able to communicate something through
language. And I think Martin Heidegger said that hope is in language.
Perhaps this hope might be about the state of being – in the broadest sense
– as a gift, or the possibility to communicate that constitutes itself through
language and thought. I’m trying to open out what hope might mean – not
thinking about it as a future thing – but in people’s everyday language and
experience.
p. 81 [Hope: new philosophies for change Mary Zournazi 2002]

- How might we create a dialogue where ideas of faith, love and care can enter into our individual and political vocabularies? Imagine a world where this is possible – a space to invent other kinds of love and care, to transform the misery, alienation and despair felt in individual and political life. p. 64 [Hope: new philosophies for change Mary Zournazi 2002]
- the kinds of revolt that can transform us and create new acts of critical thinking. At a political level, in the traditions of the Left and progressive politics, this requires a faith to overcome the limitations of the past and imagine a hopeful future. It is about what it means to be human – a rebirth in aesthetic, cultural and individual terms which involves the creative risks we can take to invent other ways of living. p. 64 [Hope: new philosophies for change Mary Zournazi 2002]
- Kristeva embraces a caring hope for the new kinds of narratives and reflections that are necessary for individual and political revolt in an increasingly desensitised world. p. 64 [Hope: new philosophies for change Mary Zournazi 2002]
- hope can only come when we live in public and political cultures where there is truly a space for dialogue – that is, a public arena where ideas are allowed and there is a space made possible for those yet to be heard. p.65 [Hope: new philosophies for change Mary Zournazi 2002]
- In the modern world, however, this camera obscura, this psychic space, is being threatened on several levels: by the crisis of family breakdowns, by the ever more aggressive world around us (whether we’re talking about the social environment, wars, or about natural, biological events), and also by the world of images – media and televisual. These three factors have unsettled that psychic space, and as a result our ability to deal with conflict. If in the face of this there is to be any hope for us, to use your term, it resides in what I would call care. p.65 [Hope: new philosophies for change Mary Zournazi 2002]
- Yes, absolutely, by care I mean the psychoanalytic cure, but also any other kinds of care, which can take the form of therapy, or the way we welcome new students to university, or the way we are mindful of older people in the street, or the disabled on public transport. here are many different kinds of attentiveness and courtesy which are frequently forgotten in a society more concerned with performance and productivity... So we can think of it this way: the notion of ‘care’ implies a concern for others, and a consideration for their ‘ill-being’. This would be a somewhat disenchanted kind of love, without the romantic, enthusiastic dimensions which cause us to distrust love. These days, however, we’ve forgotten how to attend to the suffering of others and ensure that they get the chance to start over.  p.65 [Hope: new philosophies for change Mary Zournazi 2002]
- In a crisis this ideal identity is relied upon like a crutch, but almost fanatically – ‘I don’t know who I am, I’m broke, unemployed and I’ve lost my identity, but I belong’. Belonging is a way of staving off this identity crisis. We can criticise it and see its limitations, but it’s inescapable: at this point in time humanity needs to belong in order to survive. Where we belong, whether we’re talking about family, religion, ethnicity or nationality, is like a safety-belt we can’t go without. p.66 [Hope: new philosophies for change Mary Zournazi 2002]
- giving everyone an equal chance remains a problem of the utmost importance, which is why I think that the French motto ‘Liberty, Equality, Fraternity’ is more important now than ever. It simply needs to be adapted to the modern world. p.71 
- The second point from Arendt which I think is relevant here is about
how we might value the individual, give everyone an equal chance, and
still manage to connect these individuals as a community. The answer to
that problem lies in imagining a society made up of relations between very
different individuals – something no democracy has yet managed.
Hope itself? p.71
- What is absolutely imperative is to underline the
possibility of joy. It isn’t necessarily voluntarism to rely on joy like this. You
don’t just decide to be joyous. But psychoanalysis has taught us that joy is
a way of mourning our grief. Or, to put it another way, it is only by traversing
our grief that there can be any possibility of hope.
p.75
Yes, this involves sharing differences – taking differences into account,
a sort of democracy of singularities, if you will. That’s very difficult these
days. For instance everyone says, ‘We respect homosexuals’, but when it
comes down to putting that into practice they take a step back, they won’t
compromise themselves. Or else they say, ‘We’re listening to what the
regions want’, but get cold feet as soon as Corsica demands independence.
As you can see, this is not the right time. We believe in the principle, but it
still isn’t easy to recognise and accept difference, and live with it on a daily
basis. p.72

- hope is also about a spirit of dialogue, where generosity and laughter break open a space to keep spontaneity and freedom alive – the joyful engagements possible with others. For in any conversation – individual or political, written, spoken or read – there needs to be the ability to hear, listen and give. If we shut down a discussion through resentment, fear or unwillingness – through adversity or polarised individual or political positions – generosity ceases, and the openness of real discussion and debate is diminished. [Hope: new philosophies for change Mary Zournazi 2002]
- Reflections, conversations and dialogues build new social and individual **imaginaries – visions of the world that create possibilities for change.** They lift us out of despair and let us take new risks in our encounters with each other. [Hope: new philosophies for change Mary Zournazi 2002]
- This is about collaboration – in writing, in thinking, in politics – how **working ideas together, across different styles and traditions, can let new ideas, views and expressions emerge**. This involves a sense of trust and a ‘faith without certitudes’ about where hope may lie in thinking about the future.[Hope: new philosophies for change Mary Zournazi 2002]
- In secular times, when hope has moved out of the religious sphere, the turn towards the future may be found in struggles for individual **justice**, and in political activity across the globe. p14[Hope: new philosophies for change Mary Zournazi 2002]

**Finding Hope**
- There does seem to be at the level of popular culture, **within intellectual culture, this strong temptation to bind lack of hope to being profound**, and that might be worth opening up and talking a little bit more about between you and me right now... or a little later. p.45[Hope: new philosophies for change Mary Zournazi 2002]
- I’m interested in **what hopeful visions for the future may arise, based on reconsidering what it means to be human, and how we relate to the world around us.** p.17[Hope: new philosophies for change Mary Zournazi 2002]
- We need to take a critical look at ourselves and **what we want our lives to be – not in some future or ideal sense (hope is often thought of as future- oriented) but in the act of living, the ordinary elements of everyday life**. p.18[Hope: new philosophies for change Mary Zournazi 2002]
- A ‘**joyful hope’ is about recognising our hopes in daily ways – the suffering and pain that we encounter – and about the ways we can experience ‘happiness’ outside of the spirit of capitalism**. This allows us to keep asking what risks need to be taken for a hopeful world, what habits of thought need to be changed in our cultures, and what responsibilities and ethical and political acts will make the world a hopeful place. p.19
	- Java: Being joyful is **being open to new experiences**, being willing to go through discomfort and **not foreclosing possibilities**. p.25[Hope: new philosophies for change Mary Zournazi 2002]
	- Among the concepts that designate values there are those that open upon a vision of comfort and security and those that open horizons beyond that. I would say that every joy excites values beyond the received values. [...] **Joy makes us cherish reality more than any concept we had of what is ideal**. p.26[Hope: new philosophies for change Mary Zournazi 2002]
	- There are people who have never been sick and they know what it means to be healthy. I think of all those outdoor people who go for long hikes on the weekend and for whom to be healthy and strong is a feeling of fullness and vibrancy. **You are not comparing it with being sick and you are also not comparing yourself with anyone else.** If you really feel healthy you are not going round and saying, ‘Look: those people are more zippy than those lethargic people’. I don’t think there is any comparison at all; it is an inward radiance that you feel. p.26[Hope: new philosophies for change Mary Zournazi 2002]
	- I think that **happiness can actually illuminate the past, as in the happiness of seeing your friend – where you will laugh about all the troubles of the trip. Joy can actually go backwards and transfigure the frustrations of the trip.** p.27[Hope: new philosophies for change Mary Zournazi 2002]
	- **what if you didn’t begin with the negative, but with another sense – something like joy. Where might that take the possibility or the relationship between intellectual practice and some kind of idea of revolution?** p.44[Hope: new philosophies for change Mary Zournazi 2002]
- **What might make us care for our sense of belonging, in social, political and ecological terms? What joys are possible? In uncertain times, what kinds of meaning, trust and diplomacy can move us towards the possibility of peace? What dialogues are necessary in present life, and what are the hopeful possibilities for future generations? And, in all these hopes, what might be new revolutions for our times?** p.20[Hope: new philosophies for change Mary Zournazi 2002]
- In fact I was just thinking of the line by Nietzsche in The Will to Power – the beautiful end of a sentence is: ‘ ...in impossible times when one does not know how old one is or how young one is yet to be’. I love this line. Because hope is to hope that things can be born in your life. I think that every new friend is a birth in your life. You know, when you pick up a hitchhiker, here is someone who came from nowhere in your life, with nothing in your life prepared for him. So **every new situation or friend can bring this moment of hope**. p.41[Hope: new philosophies for change Mary Zournazi 2002]
- this saying of Antonio Gramsci: **‘pessimism of the intellect and optimism of the will**’ – and this was an almost eternal, essential mantra which one had to work with. So how do you combine those two apparently opposed forces which were so important? p.45[Hope: new philosophies for change Mary Zournazi 2002]
- I remember in the late 60s someone mentioned that Lenin, of all people, had said that **‘revolution is the carnival of the oppressed’.** Well, we accept that is something that he had said and it seemed so out of character for Lenin, but I had often thought that the anarchists and the certain ultra-Left dimensions of modern politics may try and enforce that, or try to keep that spirit alive between carnival and revolt. So that work on carnival is where one could first start looking for the ideas you were talking about. I’m no expert, but some people take exactly the opposite point of view – that carnivals existed in Western Europe in the last 2000 years or whatever to appease misery, and as a holiday from reality... the sort of argument that suggests that this would allow people to better adapt to reality. p.46[Hope: new philosophies for change Mary Zournazi 2002]
- French-based writer and psychoanalyst Julia Kristeva engages with me in a dialogue of love, faith and care, and **where the possibility of revolution may lie in politics and individual life – the kinds of revolt that can transform us and create new acts of critical thinking**. At a political level, **in the traditions of the Left and progressive politics, this requires a faith to overcome the limitations of the past and imagine a hopeful future**. It is about what it means to be human – **a rebirth in aesthetic, cultural and individual terms which involves the creative risks we can take to invent other ways of living**. [...] the need to examine the ‘new maladies of the soul’ that we witness in contemporary life, such as the **destruction of the psyche and the imagination in contemporary media-oriented and performance-driven cultures**. In this context, **Kristeva embraces a caring hope for the new kinds of narratives and reflections that are necessary for individual and political revolt in an increasingly desensitised world**. p.64[Hope: new philosophies for change Mary Zournazi 2002]
- If in the face of this there is to be any **hope for us, to use your term, it resides in what I would call care**. I’m convinced of our ability to restore that psychic space to well-being, in particular through psychoanalysis. That may seem minimal, but it’s all we can do and it is in fact a form of hope. [...] Yes, absolutely, **by care I mean the psychoanalytic cure, but also any other kinds of care**, which can take the form of therapy, or the way we welcome new students to university, or the way we are mindful of older people in the street, or the disabled on public transport. **There are many different kinds of attentiveness and courtesy which are frequently forgotten in a society more concerned with performance and productivity**... So we can think of it this way: **the notion of ‘care’ implies a concern for others, and a consideration for their ‘ill-being’. This would be a somewhat disenchanted kind of love, without the romantic, enthusiastic dimensions which cause us to distrust love**. These days, however, **we’ve forgotten how to attend to the suffering of others and ensure that they get the chance to start over.** This is less about cure or resurrection than it is about renewal. We no longer think in ways that favour this kind of renewal. On the other hand, the process of transference and counter-transference involved in the psychoanalytic cure is an example of the economy of care. p.65[Hope: new philosophies for change Mary Zournazi 2002]

**Developing Hopeful Politics & Political hope (for revolution)**
- I contest various older traditions of revolutionary, socialist and Marxist thought – **revisiting the old not to replace it but to think with it, and working through some new tools for a philosophy and politics of hope**. I am looking for what might be more global notions of hope, where it may lie, and what human dignity and freedom may now require. p.19[Hope: new philosophies for change Mary Zournazi 2002]
- Surely **political hope is always somehow utopian; it is a hope that we will set up a better world and set it up to endure**. That must be true of every kind of political hope: that the situation could be different for good. I did think a long time ago that you have this kind of pattern of discourse: here was a revolution, and here is what it was seven years later when it became **ossified into a bureaucracy**. It’s a process that people follow about every revolution: the French revolution, the American, the Cuban. And that led me to think that **we really have to free the notion of liberation and revolution from the idea of permanently setting up some other kind of society**. The revolution is not something that is done ‘once and for all’. Well, it does seem like there are contradictory ideas here. On the one hand, every revolution, every political hope is for setting up a better world, but on the other hand, there is this other very difficult problem of understanding that the revolutionary fervour and act is of its nature ephemeral. **Just because it doesn’t endure doesn’t mean it was a failure**. But one of the great intoxications of revolution and the reason that it does continually recur is that those who fight the revolution find it a kind of moment of effervescence, of transfiguration. **Even if it fails, it was a summit experience for people in common**. p.38[Hope: new philosophies for change Mary Zournazi 2002]
- the use of motifs from the Bible, in civil rights movements in the US, and so on – I mean, **‘We shall overcome’ is the motif, really, of political struggle** p.43[Hope: new philosophies for change Mary Zournazi 2002]
- I think **hope would link to the idea of practical politics** inspired by Benjamin that we raised earlier, and the now time – the possibility of dismantling and **finding another language to build politics and visions anew**. For instance, hope would lie in **re-envisaging political discourses and how we define reality**. Rethinking politics and the machinations of political rhetoric – that **takes us outside of adversarial and polemic positions and moves into more sustained and concrete actions** (finding ways to ‘mourn’ the loss of certain notions of human dignity and activism, and working through what might be effective for the Left now). And this would be about **finding a ‘politics of hope’...** p.48[Hope: new philosophies for change Mary Zournazi 2002]

**Prefigurative: Temporarily Living differently**
- Peter Lamborn Wilson, who is an anarchist writer in the New York area. He has this concept of ‘temporary autonomous zones’ (or ‘TAZ’, which my students love). The idea is that **there are moments, hours, weeks, months or even years whereby groups of people get it together to test freedom (which we will leave vague and undefined). And then it collapses** – so these experiments, these temporary autonomous zones, **are bound to fail**. You enter into them with the notion that it is like carnival – that it is temporary – and these are expressed in all sorts of different ways: through history, actual revolts, marginal people who have been able to find some autonomy away from their families or communities or the state or whatever it might be. So how hope fits into that is interesting, because it is a type of controlled pessimism or it’s a mix of pessimism and optimism, because you need the optimism to be carnivalesque or the carnival stimulates that optimistic stance in the world. It seems to me that this is done in a very sophisticated way and that one realises one is living in an ‘artificial kingdom’. It’s like going to the theatre where you **suspend disbelief and you become full of hope**, but there’s another part of you which says it can’t last forever. So that seems to me what human beings are about – that level of complexity, the ability to hold opposite ideas at once – and I think that is where I would really be most comfortable talking about hope – in a field where hope and lack of hope are organised into a sort of dynamic mix. p.47[Hope: new philosophies for change Mary Zournazi 2002]

**Leadership**
- **There’s an ambiguous line when a leader, through some kind of continuous process, turns into a dictator if he or she seizes power** – where that heroism closes up into itself. **In the end, he is just pursuing his own dream, his own vision or will**. And **there are those heroes whom we all kind of instinctually admire.** For instance, in Nicaragua during the Sandinista period the leaders went every weekend to villages and **had meetings with the people and listened to their criticisms and complaints. But they were also very human**: they ate and drank, sometimes too much, they had lovers and so on. I think too of Nelson Mandela, who breaks out dancing with crowds. One of my ideas is that **we recognise someone of our own kind in laughter. When we see someone with whom we do not laugh, that person seems to us to be an alien or from another species**. I think that before we understand anyone there is this laughter. When you are in a country where you don’t understand anyone because you don’t know the language and they don’t know your language, there are moments when you laugh together, when the eyes meet over some amusing incident and you feel like one of them. We always think of the real hero as someone who has grown up in a country and we say he loves this country, these people, these slum-dwellers, and is really one with them. But it seems to me that **the most fundamental fact of a hero is not that he has some kind of idealistic ideology** that these slum-dwellers deserve justice or they are the proletariat and **he should fight for them**. **It is that he genuinely enjoys being with them, would prefer to sit on the stoop and have a glass of rum with the slum-dwellers and tell jokes** than to sit in an office and plan strategies. p.31[Hope: new philosophies for change Mary Zournazi 2002]

**Gifting**
- in the more global and technological world – **hope is often linked, I would say, to some kind of monetary or material exchange**. So **responsibility is not tied to some form of unconditionality; it is linked to what can be gained or can be taken from people**. So, in a different way, I’m thinking about the relation of hope and the idea of the ‘gift’ – which you have written about – **the responsibility and unconditionality that the notion of giving could take on if it is not tied to some capitalist claim or an exploitative relationship between people**. In that sense, how does the possibility of the unconditional, responsibility, giving and exchange, take on another form in the very basic act of giving between people, but also in a political sense? **What if ‘exchange’ wasn’t about appropriation – what possibilities are there in conceiving gifts and hope**. Is that too huge? p.37[Hope: new philosophies for change Mary Zournazi 2002]
- it seems to me that **a real gift is always a kind of liberation**. A liberation towards something grand and something more grand. The most beautiful recent case I can think of is: a friend of mine in Japan called me and said, ‘I’ve just turned 50’. To give himself a birthday present he gave a round-the-world ticket to two of his students. He freed himself from this money and wants nothing in return. He freed his soul from the kind of anxiety that everybody feels when you turn 50 and you want to hold onto your own life and you realise life is beginning to decline. And of course the students in question were free to travel around the planet and to open their sensibility, their hearts, their minds to all kinds of new things. p.37[Hope: new philosophies for change Mary Zournazi 2002]
-  **If we evoke the capacity for joy** which every moment of hope can embody, then creativity – in intellectual, political, personal terms – takes on a new meaning. **This is a real carnival of possibility and revolutionary spirit, where hope can be a dialogue about gifts and exchange in another sense – the spirit of generosity** – which is often lacking in western living and critical thinking. And what if hope and despair mean different things in different cultures – how do we then begin to define the spirit of things? **What ‘islands of hope’ are possible – the acts of giving that open a gateway to the imagination and possibility in the midst of individual and political uncertainty?** p.42[Hope: new philosophies for change Mary Zournazi 2002]
- The point I would take from Thus Spoke Zarathustra, let’s say for argument’s sake and your interest in hope, is about this overflowing exchange between people, and here we come back to your class issues – **such that generosity and hope would be mingled with unleashing the spirit of the gift, alongside or in place of the spirit of the commodity**. p.60[Hope: new philosophies for change Mary Zournazi 2002]

## Cultivating hope
### In university
Nikos: Hope and exile, of course, are often thought of as polar conditions.
Sometimes they are connected in the sense that you leave a country with
the hope for something better, and sometimes they are the opposite – you
leave because you’ve lost hope at home. I guess that through exile you
realise how necessary but elusive hope is – necessary for living and elusive
because you never quite get what you thought you would get at the end
of the journey. And, at the end of the journey, you realise that the journey
continues and that it is one of the many journeys you will be doing in the
rest of your life. p.79 [Hope: new philosophies for change Mary Zournazi 2002]
You could argue
that the work of the Frankfurt school was very much informed by exile. And
even certain concepts, like Karl Marx’s ‘alienation’ or Max Weber’s notion of
the disenchantment in modern life, or Georg Simmel’s idea of the stranger,
are fundamental motifs for thinking about the exilic conditions of modern
culture. [Hope: new philosophies for change Mary Zournazi 2002]
