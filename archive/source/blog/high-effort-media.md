Update 2024-07-10: I've recently started watching some TVNZ content online. It's really cool to enjoy New Zealand made media! Heaps of learning materials on there too about Te Ao MƒÅori

I want to move away from low effort media. High effort is just so much better!

I'm refferring here to media/texts that aren't produced cheaply, as in, minimal time, effort, and cost.

I want to read, watch and listen to work that was worth someone's time to make. 
I want to create things that took time to make.

Subscribing to [Dropout.tv](Dropout.tv) was definitely a good move.
Seeing the production value they are able to create because they are being paid by the people who watch is awesome!
They are also all very talanted people who care for their crafts.

Some misculaneous thoughts on this...
- High effort works need to be resourced, and thus funded. It's hard to fund good work.
    - Advertising requires a broad audience as well as sometimes compromising the work itself
    - Attracting funding requires connnections and cultural captial which may further marginalise work by specific, hard-done-by demographics.
    - I think the best way to fund creative work is to provide resources which make it cheaper to do interesting things.
        - This means providing gear, education etc. but it also could mean making sure everyone has food and housing.
        - If living costs are lower (hours spent working to survive) then other things can thrive (including creativity!)
        - [We see in nations with good social welfare systems awesome examples of creativity & innovation!](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2444569X22000725#sec0020)
- Notably, AI is a lean away from high effort production.
