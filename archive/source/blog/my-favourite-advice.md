## [How to Create Luck](https://www.swyx.io/create-luck)
Key points:
- you can actively create optimal conditions for lucky things to happen to you
- Jason Roberts coined the term ”Luck Surface Area”, and it was expanded by Sean Murphy and popularized by Patrick McKenzie.
    - Create a luck “catchment area”: position yourself in a way that captures more of it
    - Jason's suggests **do more things**, and **tell more people about it**. Embodies an active attitude of orienting life for positive events.
     It’s ”Fixed vs Growth mindset” adapted for luck.
- Luck found in four ways
    - 🌱 Accidental Luck:
        - Success depends on where the seed lands. 
        - Not very interesting, no agency, only privilege.
    - 🏃🏽‍♀️ Active Luck:
        - Derived from constant movement. 
        - No direction needed
        - Increases success through increasing number of tries.
        - “I have never heard of anyone stumbling on something sitting down.” - Charles Kettering
        - “You don’t get extreme results without extreme actions.” - Derek Sivers
    - 💊 Prepared Luck: 
        - Noticing opportunities that others miss.
        - Example: Alexander Fleming’s discovery of penicillin
            - Accident
            - Fleming was “uniquely equipped to observe it” (skills etc)
            - AND he took action to confirm the observation.
        - “Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity.” - Seneca
        - “Chance favors the prepared mind.” - Louis Pasteur
        - Gian-Carlo Rota on Richard Feynman on how to be a genius: 
            1. Keep a dozen problems present in your mind. 
            2. When exposed to a new trick or a result, test it against each of your problems to see whether it helps.
            3. Occassionally there will be a hit
            4. Success
    - 🧲 Magnetic Luck:
        - AKA. "individualized action"
        - Chances come to you because of who you are and how you behave.
        - Unlike Active Luck, Magnetic Luck is *directed* motion. You have a hunch, so you pursue it, and luck appears ([ref](https://medium.com/@ameet/the-four-kinds-of-luck-ea729970d71d)).
            - Swyx links this to switching to ['Miner Mode'](https://www.swyx.io/learning-gears#miner)
                - For when you’ve struck gold.
                - Identified something that resonates with people, that you are also abnormally fascinated by. When you strike gold, you’ll know. Stop and plant your flag.
- Swyx's Customisation
    - Treats both axes as a spectrum rather than binary
    - Focuses on action rather than classification
    - “Active vs Passive” becomes “Active Habits”
    - “Individual vs General” becomes “Good Strategy”
    - About HOW you get more lucky e.g. [Claim a Domain (personal branding)]((https://www.swyx.io/marketing-yourself)) or Hustle and understand what these entail
- Habits
    - Exploring is Actively Habitual, non Strategic activities.
        - Understanding the value of principles that are generally good habits (e.g. learn/build in public, do more & communicate it), and trusting in the process
    - Prospecting is a highly Active habit, and highly Strategic.
        - By having measures of where you are likely to have success (e.g. access to people in your field) you can consistently assess and move towards areas where you are more likely to be “lucky”.
        - It might look like luck to others, but the motion and intention you invested to get yourself in a position to be lucky was far from random.
        - Strategic manoeuvring for “Megatrends” is a good idea.

    - A good introduction into managing finances. However the comment on Renting vs Buying seemed a surface-level examination.
    - For me the 'price' of renting has a lot of less-visible factors, particularly housing insecurity which has led me to move 20 times in my life (11 times between ages 18-24). The anxiety surrounding being housing-insecure as a renter has cost me so much. [Additionally, New Zealand is the most expensive country in the OECD in terms of proportion of renter's pay going towards their rent](https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/business/520050/renting-is-very-expensive-nz-s-global-distinction#:~:text=More%20than%2025%20percent%20of,for%20the%20lowest%2Dincome%20tenants) so this is likely much less applicable here.
