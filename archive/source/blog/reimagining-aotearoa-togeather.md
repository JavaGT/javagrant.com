Today I attended a hui with the [Council of Trade Unions](https://union.org.nz) as a member of the [Tertiary Education Union](https://teu.ac.nz). Called [Reimagining Aotearoa Together](https://www.instagram.com/reimagining_aotearoa_together/)

Was awesome to hear that people are considering the future of Aotearoa bottom-up just as I am working to create a space to reconsider the future of our universities bottom-up.

The process was fun and got to talk to people who are very invested in how we can improve our country, particularly for workers. I am particularly fond of the goal of "good work". Because I've done shit workâ€“and it sucksâ€“but I find many forms of work very rewarding and would do it for freeeee (if I could still live).
