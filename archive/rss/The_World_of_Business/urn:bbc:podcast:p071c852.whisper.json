This podcast is supported by advertising outside the UK. Welcome to Carnival, Uruguay style. The main shopping street through the middle of Montevideo, it's absolutely packed out with people. This is the opening parade of their annual carnival. The absolute riot of color and sound and dancing. There's people here from all walks of life, families, friends, people drinking. But also there's a very distinctive smell in the air. What are you smoking there? Marijuana. Marijuana. Marijuana. It's legal, no problem. We're smoking wheat. We're smoking wheat. Now it's legal here. Marijuana. The marijuana is legal. You can smoke in front of the police and no problem. For in business, I've come to explore the cannabis industry here in Urugu the police, no problem. For in business, I've come to explore the cannabis industry here in Uruguay, the first country in the world to legalize recreational marijuana. Uruguay is tucked between Argentina and Brazil in the southeast corner of South America. Its plans to legalize cannabis were announced in 2012, the same year the US states of Colorado and Washington voted to legalize it. Since then, the number of US states with illegal recreational marijuana has risen to 10 plus the District of Columbia, and, late last year year Canada joined the party. Back in 2016 we visited Colorado and found producers and dispensaries jockeying for space in an open and rapidly expanding market. They were also having to deal with the challenges of an industry that's legal at state level, but still illegal federally. So, what does the marijuana industry look like when it's legal at a national level? Where does medicinal marijuana legalized at the same time here fit in? And what can others learn from Uruguay's approach? When Uruguay's last president, Jose Mujica, announced a set of policies designed to deal with violent crime in the country, no one was expecting the legalization of marijuana. It came as a surprise, yes. Gishirmo Draper is the political editor of Buskida, one of Uruguay's best-known weekly newspapers, and has co-written a book on his country's pioneering experiment with marijuana. President Mujica signed the marijuana law at the end of 2013, but sales to the public didn't start until July 2017. It took them time. The government says because they wanted to do it precisely and step by step and step and they say, well, and actually we accomplished it. We began with the cell. The only places allowed to sell recreational marijuana in Uruguay are pharmacies. But in the short time marijuana has been on sale, some have already had to withdraw the product. He says we sold a lot of cannabis, like the first day. We sold 1,250 packages in six hours in this pharmacy. People were doing a two-block queue to get marijuana. Esteban Riviera, a big bear of a man with a silver chain around his neck, talks to me from behind a desk in the back of his pharmacy, with the help of Carla Coleman, my fixer and translator. So he's showing me a video on his phone of all the people queuing outside this pharmacy and went, so this was in 2017, 2017. In the US, one of the biggest problems for the cannabis industry has been with banking. US federal laws say banks can't deal with money associated with controlled substances, and that includes marijuana. But Uruguay changed its law at a national level and it's a sovereign country, so no problem, right? Wrong. Back then I had a 25 years account in a bank here in Uruguay and they wanted just to keep me out because of something I didn't have really nothing to do with. He told me like I have five days to either stop selling cannabis or cross my account in the bank. And that's what I ended up doing. I stopped selling cannabis. I was the first pharmacy registered to sell cannabis, but I was also the first pharmacy that stopped selling cannabis in Uruguay. Banks like Esteban's rely on partnerships with US banks for their international transactions. But those partnerships came under threat when the US banks learnt their Uruguayan counterparts were dealing with marijuana money. Uruguay might be a different country but it's still affected by the US's strict finance laws on controlled substances. That's one of the reasons so few pharmacies here at stock marijuana. They have to find ways round the banking problem. There are just 17 pharmacies selling cannabis and even for a small country of 3.5 million people that doesn't seem like many. It's just before 1 o'clock on a Wednesday afternoon. We're in a quite middle-class area from Montevideo. We're just next to a pharmacy and outside there's a queue of I'd say about 20 people some of them standing and chatting some of them sitting on the floor. Let's go and see what they're doing here. Hey I'm standing in the middle of the sun burning hot waiting for we are the ones who didn't make it to the reservation online. So we have to wait till 2pm. So they're still selling, we can buy 5 or 10 grams. You're quite far back. How many people do you think are in front of you? This is good. This is one of the pharmacy who has more packages to sell without reservation. There's another pharmacies that have less, so a lot of people go home without wheat, and that's pretty sad. The system's tightly controlled. Customers have to register with the regulator and then are limited to buying 10 grams a week, enough for about 20 joints. The rationale for changing the law here was to move buyers from the illegal market to a new legal one. But some customers tell me they use both. What's the quality like compared to what you buy on the black market? Low. Exactly. So there's a guy saying it doesn't get you high in the same way. What's the price like? Is it cheaper here? It's cheaper here because the quality. Some people say it's better here in pharmacists than the black market and there's people that prefers the black market and there's people that prefers the black market well. Much of this debate is around the level of THC in the marijuana on sale in pharmacies. THC is a psychoactive compound, the thing that makes you high. Its impact can be mitigated by another compound found in marijuana, CBD, which is said to have a calming effect. In pharmacies, there are just four different strains available to buy, and their THC and CBD levels are controlled by the regulator, so the marijuana's psychoactive effects are limited. Pharmacist Gabriel Shano shows me the product, ready to be sold directly from two big plastic storage boxes stacked up behind the counter. This first one is white and green. This is Indica, that I say 9% and CBD 3%. It's kind of the size of a small book and it's plasticy and I can feel the marijuana inside. It's quite plain and it's got some warning symbols on it, not for pregnant women, not for driving, not for people under 18 and then it's not for people carrying a briefcase, so you can't smoke and go to work. I can't see anything in your window that tells people you sell marijuana. Ah, no we can't do publicity, so that we're, like we're making marijuana and that's not permitted. So we's saying we're not allowed to advertise. So it's saying we're not allowed to advertise. By the law, it's not induced to what would be to what would be the consumer. So it's saying the law says you can't encourage people to consume cannabis. The price, about six or seven US dollars for a five grand packet, is set by the regulator. Gabriel says he gets only about 20% of the purchase price from each packet he sells, although there's a higher profit margin on related products, like munchies and smoking papers, a slightly odd sight in a pharmacy. By two o'clock, the queues more than doubled in length since we arrived. But finally, for those at the front at least, the weights over. Indicatern't. Yes. I don't know how can... Two. So, this woman's just asked for two packets and handed over her cash. What happens now? I'm waiting for the print. Ah, so you have to give your thumbprint, your fingerprint. Yes. Gabrielle says his bank has let him keep his account, as long as marijuana sales are cash only. But when we ask his bank about this deal, they say that they don't work with businesses linked to cannabis and that they are continuing to close the account of such businesses, quotes, when appropriate. So, perhaps Gabriel's arrangement is an informal one. Okay, authorised. Thank you. Enjoy. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. For those who like their marijuana stronger, there is a legal alternative, growing your own, either at home or as part of a club. Hi, Martin. I'm Simon. Nice to meet you. Very distinct smell as we're walking. I'm the president of the El Piso Academy Club. I'm personally a programmer. I own a game studio, and I do this for a hobby. What have you got in here? So this is the place where the plants grow, you know, plants have two states growing and then flowering. I can see six or seven rows of plants, which are maybe half a meter tall, and there's definitely a strong smell of marijuana and because it's usually completely dark here at the moment we're using torches and so we're kind of casting quite an eerie shadow of cannabis plants on the wall dancing around in the fans. Very poetic. A handful of the club's 45 members sit round the table enjoying the fruits of their labours as Martin explains to me how the club works. While they pay rent and a fat electricity bill, the club isn't technically a business. By law, we have a legal structure of a non-profit organization. The only paid salary is at the gardens. It seems that some clubs are making a bit of money though, selling their excess produce. We're in a cannabis grow shop here that sells pipes and fertilizer and all sorts of other paraphernalia but up on the counter there's some brownies in individual plastic cases and they look like very nice, moist, rich brownies. What's special about this brownie? The brownies have mani, chocolate and the covertura, and two grams of products special. This brownie has peanuts, chocolate and two grams of cannabis. We call it products for astronauts. So we think where you're eating here chocolate and two grams of cannabis. We call it products for astronauts. So we think, were you eating here? You're part of the astronaut crew. Here is what you're doing legal? No regularized. The law never ever saw or never saw that could eat the matri-o-it-a-ma-o- it's not regularized. The law doesn't include the cannabis in things you can eat. So we're trying to get it regularized so we can sell it everywhere. Actually it's not legal, which is probably why Gonzalo only wants to tell me his first name. The regulator has so far licensed only the marijuana sold in pharmacies to smoke and a cannabis drink that's CBD-based so it doesn't get you high. Any other marijuana-based recreational product is illegal, as is buying your cannabis from a club, which is how Gonzalo gets his supplies. Nonetheless, business is good, he says, with up to 300 brownies a week sold at grow shops and a Sunday market, enough to keep him in full-time employment. and a Sunday market, enough to keep him in full-time employment. It's part of what's described here as the grey market. In Punta deleste, a holiday spot up the coast from Montevideo, foreign tourists come looking for cannabis, even though they're not allowed to buy it. This place is THC Hostel. And where does the name come from? The name comes from tetraido, cannabino, you know? Cannabis, marijuana, which for us is a lifestyle. The energetic Rameses Castillo runs this backpacker hostel with a twist. And do you personally grow your own? Yes, I do. And but you sometimes share that with guests as well? All the time. If I were being cynical, I might say you're really, you are selling cannabis because you're taking money from people to stay here and then you're giving them cannabis. Isn't that the same as selling cannabis? Not at all and I don't really like what you're telling, to be honest, because that's not the way it works here. And you're not worried about the authorities coming along and saying, you know, really you're telling to be honest because that's not the way it works here and you're not worried about the authorities coming along and saying you know really you're selling cannabis you're very happy that everything they have done several times and they didn't have nothing to say because there's no selling cannabis here and for them it's very difficult to to to be able to demonstrate that people are selling because maybe they say hey i'm going to give you this flower to you hey man thank you they say, hey, I'm going to give you this flower to you. Hey man, thank you very much. You're very awesome. I want to give you this money because you are awesome. Right. So if there are a transaction, well, demonstrated. So if one of the hostels Uruguayan guests is, let's be frank, selling marijuana to foreigners behind closed doors, Ramses doesn't seem too bothered. While some of those in this grey market have got in trouble, the authorities seem to be more interested in stopping business that's linked to organised crime. To do that, they need the legal market to be working effectively and the queues outside the pharmacies suggest it isn't. I put that to Diego Riviera, the Secretary General of Uruguay's National Drugs Board, who also oversees the cannabis regulator IECA. We anticipate that the businesses that are producing are going to be able to produce at a faster pace. In Uruguay, no one had ever grown marijuana on a big scale before. We started with two businesses producing and today we see that two businesses isn't enough, and that's why we are inviting new businesses to apply for licenses so we can reduce the supply problem. Why not let the existing producers, now they know what they're doing, expand their operations? Learning the lessons of the tobacco and alcohol industries, we don't want big concentrations of economic power around a few businesses. The idea of having various producers also favours the position of the regulator and allows us effectively to carry out the regulation to protect public health. Recreational sales in Uruguay have amounted to about 2.5 million US dollars so far. In the same period in Colorado, sales were 1.5 billion US dollars. Colorado's population is about 50% bigger than Uruguay's, nowhere near accounting for such a huge difference. So, why aren't Uruguayan businesses raking in the cash like those in Colorado? Firstly, because the regulatory models are very different. Colorado accepts that visitors, people from outside the state, can buy marijuana. Colorado doesn't have limits on buying for personal use or doesn't control them very strictly. I think basically Colorado had a focus on creating quite a free market which is the culture in the US that generates a lot of profit and then taking those profits to invest in education. We've preferred having a more controlled market. The regulator controls not just who sells and who produces recreational marijuana, but also how it's produced. Until now, no one's seen what that process looks like. The one and only site where recreational marijuana is legally grown and processed has been a closely kept secret. But now, I'm among a small group of journalists bundled into an early morning minibus and we're on our way to the production site. The other journalists tell me they've been asking to visit this place for literally years. Now at last, we're going in. We've just pulled off the motorway and driven about three minutes on an increasingly bumpy track and there's been no signs at all but suddenly we've come across a field with a barrier and a soldier with a rather large automatic rifle hanging around his neck. He's just checking on his walkie-talkie that we're actually allowed in. We're walking into one of the big greenhouses now. You can see some cameras and fingerprint scanners, very tight security. Okay, we're going into one which says mothers on the door. It's about 20 quite large cannabis plants in here and then maybe another 30 or 40 smaller ones at the other end of the room. Bright lights hanging from the ceiling. Big extractor fans whirring away. Ugo Bettencourt, a mild-mannered man in gardening gear, is in charge of production for ICC, one of the two companies with licenses to grow recreational marijuana. So he's explaining that this is a room with mother plants, which are then cloned to make the others, and each of them have barcodes on them so that they can trace every plant and they know where it comes from. Gashir Mo Draper, the journalist who's written a book on marijuana in Uruguay, is on the tour with me. He says these companies can't make big profits on recreational marijuana because the government... Tells them what kind of marijuana to produce, where to sell it, what price. I mean, it's a really tight control in no place that's good for business. But Gishamo says when it comes to medicinal marijuana, it's a different story. That's an industry that Uruguay sees as having big business potential. The government is pushing that forward, and that was another thing that was sold as a good idea for Uruguay from the Mujica's government, that this was going to create a new industry because you will have the best law in the world at that point to boost these kind of investments. So how is the medicinal side of the industry fairing here? There is some crossover with the recreational business. ICC, whose greenhouses we've just been wandering round, is also involved in medicinal marijuana, which has higher profit margins and a growing number of potential export markets. It seems that's why a big Canadian cannabis company, Aurora, just paid 220 million US dollars for ICC. Aurora said that the acquisition would position them as the market leader in Latin America. They aren't the only Canadian company looking south. My name is Alonso Martinez and I am in charge of operations here in Varel. And we're just driving along a quite bumpy road. And this is big flat, expansive land, lots of agricultural land here. What do you do in Varel? Actually this was, before we buy it, this was supposed to produce oranges. Oh, I can see some trees, yeah, a grove over there. And we had to cut around 40 or 50 hectares of those old trees to grow CBD hemp plants here. CBD hemp is defined as marijuana with less than 1% THC, the stuff that gets you high. So because it doesn't have much psychoactive effect, it's regulated more lightly, but not that lightly. You have to go through different organisms of the government. They need to know where the money come from and it took us almost nine months to get approval and where did the money come from at the beginning it was private private investors and then we got a partnership with a Canadian company called Oxley they have 80% of the company and how much did they pay for that that's a top secret information now it was around 15 million dollars what stage is the business at are you making a profit no not no no we are at stage one this is the first year we are growing seriously open field. We have 200 hectares in production right now. We're establishing our extraction facility and we are going to start producing CBD oil extract. We have projected to start in October of this year. It's a gorgeous day here, barely a cloud in sight. Lovely breeze to cool you down and there's just a couple of workers here going through the field. It's like they're planting some seedlings. In this plot we have around 10 and 15,000 plants. Wow. Yeah, that's a lot. They should produce 1.5 tons of seeds for next season. What we are looking for is to get pharmaceutical grade of the CBD so pharmacies or final consumer knows what they are taking. I mean you can put in a pill of 10 milligrams you can put two, three four milligrams of CBD. Why would somebody take a CBD pill or cannabis oil? For me in my case it's just relaxing. I feel good. I don't feel the same effects of the THC. It tranquilizes me and I think most of the people finds something similar and that's why this is growing that fast. I mean, it's not only to treat Parkinson's or spasants or headaches or it's a natural element. What's your market and where is it? Our market is the world, actually. We have some partnerships in Canada, we have some partnerships in Mexico, we have some partnerships in Brazil. I think cannabis soil is going to be legal in the whole world in the next 10 years. Once the CBD is extracted, there are also potential uses for the hemp fiber, like briquettes for fires, bricks for construction, or even plates and cutlery. The market for THC-based medicines is less developed. Because it's the part of marijuana that gets you high, it's more controversial. Fottmer, a firm here privately owned by a combination of Uruguayans and Americans, is the first with a license to produce THC for medicinal use. I am Elena Gonzalez Ramos. I am the manager of quality and R&D here in Fodmart. We are in a science park which is located at a free zone because EuroWI gives this opportunity for projects that are looking for export and so it has some benefits this is a slightly strange sight because it's a guy who looks like he he might be a hospital surgeon except he's not operating on a person he's he's pruning a plant we really treat our plants as if we were really in a medical area because it is the purpose to be raw material for medical production. What are the end products of this whole process? One of the most accepted uses of THC is for chronic pain, specifically when it is neuropathic. That means when it is caused by a damage of the nervous system, central or peripheral, spasticity that is rigid in your muscles, palliative care, vomiting, nausea, and well then there are many other uses that are being researched. Where are the pharmaceutical companies that you're hoping to work with based? Our main focus is in export and well the main markets nowadays are Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Germany and some others mainly in Europe. And the regulation is changing all the time so the forecasts are also promising and it's being more legalized around the world. The stigma attached to marijuana use, particularly as medicine, seems to be waning in much of the Western world. That's a huge cultural shift and one that's opening up business opportunities. In Uruguay, their tightly controlled recreational industry shows liberalizing laws doesn't always mean liberal markets. When it comes to medicinal marijuana, Uruguayan firms are among those spearheading a rapidly growing global industry. That's showing the potential to have a much bigger impact on the world, both for businesses and for patients looking for a better quality of life. That's all from the world of business with me, Simon Mabin. My fixer and translator in Uruguay was Carla Colman. The program was mixed by James Beard and the editor is Penny Murphy.
