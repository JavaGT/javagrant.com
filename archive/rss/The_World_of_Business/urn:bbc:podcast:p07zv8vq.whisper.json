This podcast is supported by advertising outside the UK. Welcome to the World of Business Podcast. I'm Manuela Saragossa. Thanks for downloading this episode, which is the last in a special series we've been running looking at energy around the world. We're in Italy, a country which has been experimenting with what could be the fuel of the world. We're in Italy, a country which has been experimenting with what could be the fuel of the future. Venice, an ancient city that may not survive modern times. Climate change threatens to sink it. And even though there are no cars, air pollution is a big problem here. It really is urgent that the issue of air quality in Venice is addressed. Jane D'Amosto is an environmental scientist and local campaigner. It's not just human health, but it's also the monuments of Venice are being destroyed by the particulate matter that turns the buildings black, the acidity of the sulphur oxides and the nitrogen oxides eat away at this really incredible stonework. And there's a man I know who lives near the cruise port at Santa Marta. And when he was a little boy, there was a sculpture of the Madonna on the side of his family home. And then when he got a bit bigger, you could barely make out it was the Madonna. And he showed it to me the other day, and you just couldn't even see that there was this, you know, bariliette carving ever on the facade of that building we're standing quayside it's a beautiful sunny day for the main canal of venice the jadeca canal it's absolutely bustling with activity lots of ferries and water taxis. Behind me is the Byzantine St. Mark's Basilica and the most popular tourist spot of the city, St Mark's Square. All these boats here and all these ferries and all these water taxis are belching diesel fumes, which makes Venice one of the worst cities when it comes to air pollution in Italy, which is the big ironine. Jane, you're here to tell us why that is. Daily constant traffic movement of goods, services, people, drinks, food, souvenirs and huge amounts of dirty linen that need to be taken out. And huge energy use, and the other side of the canal is the industrial shipping channel that has hundreds of container and industrial ships. We need a global solution to all sources of air pollution in and around Venice. Some here in Italy believe they have the answer to Venice's pollution problem. It's been called the magic molecule, a fuel that emits no carbon fumes, only water vapour. Clean fuel that can be made from renewable sources like solar panels and wind turbines. What is it? Well, it's hydrogen. You may not know this, but you could already drive a hydrogen powered car. Toyota is selling one on the market right now. It's called the Mirai, Japanese for Future. I'm trying one out in central London with Professor Nigel Brandon. He's the director of the UK's hydrogen and fuel cell hub. Toyota have kindly lent us use of the car. There are not many in the UK. I think they've brought 50 over to the UK and they've sold or provided, you know, users such as ourselves with access to all of those. So, yeah, small, not very many at the moment. You're absolutely right. And if anyone wanted to buy a car like this, how much would they be paying? This car, I believe, sells for about £66,000 if you wanted to buy one. So that's what, $72,000? $73,000. Yep, that's right. So it's not cheap. Not cheap at all. No, it's not. But, that's right. So not cheap, not cheap at all. No, it's not, but these are still vehicles relatively, whilst they are commercially available, this is the world's first hydrogen fuel cell car that you can actually buy and own, but still relatively early numbers. So you can imagine that the costs of producing these are still somewhat high. Toyota paint an analogy to the Prius. You know, when they first brought that to the market, that was quite an expensive vehicle. They subsidised it, but out of that eventually has come their largest selling power train globally. So they have a similar long-term view for this technology. I can open the car up. So it's... You're going to show us the boot? Yeah. Okay, so it's a normal sized boot that you'd find in any sort of normal sedan car. It's slightly compromised and what you can see there is one of the two hydrogen storage tanks. That's enough to drive the car about 300 miles. If you go and fuel this car up at one of the refueling points around London, it costs about £60 to fill it up with hydrogen. Right, so let's, um, can I open the driver's seat? Is it an automatic? Yes. It's an automatic that means I can drive. I can't drive gear sticks, but I can drive automatics. I'm going to go and sit down. I don't think you should drive it today though because you're not, so you're not insured. Can you drive it? I could drive it, sure. Anyway, I'm just going to sit behind the wheel. I think it's an electric seat adjustment on the side. Can I turn the engine on? You can. I'll drive it. I promise I will drive it. I'm just remember the process by which you do. I think you just press the button. Power. Okay, I'll just try that. So the wheel, the, the steering wheel is coming out and adjusting itself. If you push your foot on the brake pedal and hold the brake pedal in, yeah, and then with the foot on the brake pedal, press the button. Okay. Feels a bit, this is the way I would, okay, so the car is now started. Panels come on. And it's completely quiet. It's so quiet. You can't really tell the difference between driving in this kind of a hydrogen-fueled car and an electric or hybrid vehicle. It has the same kind of feel to it, really. I mean, there is a bit of a race on at the moment, isn't there, between hybrid electric vehicles and these kind of vehicles, the ones we're sitting in now, the hydrogen-powered ones. I mean, it doesn't sound like hydrogen is anywhere ahead in this race at the moment. Does it really have a future? I mean, realistically, given the kind of evangelising there is about hybrid and electric vehicles? Well, I mean, so hybrid vehicles are still fossil-based, so you can't get to where you need to be with hybrid. So hybrid alone is not the answer. So really the competition is between battery electric or hydrogen fuel cell electric. And it's absolutely true that battery electric is a head. Well, hybrid is well established and is fine for where we are today, but will not get us to where we want to be in terms of a zero carbon future. Battery electric is making great progress, but it's tough to see long-distance trucks, large vehicles running only on electricity. So why hydrogen? Particularly as vehicle size gets bigger, trucks, buses, you can refuel this vehicle in three minutes to do 300 miles. It takes a lot longer to refuel an electric vehicle. So for me, there's a strong overlap and benefit of having both options on the table. Okay, turn it off now? Yeah. Perfect. Thank you very much your time. So there is a future for hydrogen in transport, especially when it comes to heavy vehicles travelling long distances, using lots of fuel and for which short refueling times are essential. Well, my name is Beryl Schmidt. I'm retired. I used to be, I started my life as a journalist for in the car industry, most of my time in Europe and in America and in China. And I'm retired and I write about cars. So that's me. So you're in Japan where hydrogen cars are the big thing. How common are them? And do you see them driving around? Not really. The Mirai is Japanese for future, and it definitely is the future. I mean, it's not now. They are working on 10-fold expansion. They have a lot of time. I've seen charts going to 2050. 2050 is a key year in the climate change calendar. It's a deadline set by the Paris Agreement, a legally binding deal signed by 195 countries to cut global carbon emissions. The car industry is sitting up and taking note. What matters is that they are needed. You are in London. You know what the regulations are for the coming year, you know, 95 grams per kilometer, CO2. The car industry is much higher, it's freaking out, okay? The only ones who are actually at 95 is Toyota because of hybrid. European industry planned to do that with diesel. Diesel is dead. So now they have to switch to electric. So that's what's happening, and it has to happen. So hydrogen is a key part of the car industry's attempt to meet new regulations on emissions. But back in Venice, a potential answer to all of its air pollution problems is sitting stranded in the corner of a shipyard on the outskirts of the city. Quite a large boat is about 20 metres long. Everyone's nodding. 16 metres is probably most of it. It's called the hepic, as in H-E-P-I-C, but it's nodding. 16 meters is probably well said. It's called the HEPIC, as in HEPIC, but it's a virgin. It's never been in water or if it has been in water. Not really. Not really. Not really. Can you introduce yourself? Introduce yourself. Okay, my name is Matteo Amethis. I'm Deputy Director of Venet Innovazione, the Regional Agency for research and innovation and in-house of company. The idea to convert the traffic in the lagoon in green traffic is completely no emission boat. So tell us how much it costs to develop? More or less one and a half million of euro. And how long did it take to develop? More or less one and a half million of euro. And how long did it take to develop? Two years, but most of this time is due to the low aspect. The legal challenge. Thank you very much. You have the boat, but it's not allowed to sail because the Italian laws do not allow a boat without a... not permit to this kind of engine boat because of hydrogen is not in the list of the permitted fuel. All of which brings us to another obstacle hydrogen faces, its image, mentioned hydrogen, and many people might think of the hydrogen bomb. It's a volatile gas after all. But Nina Skorupska of the Renewable Energy Association in the UK says risks can be mitigated. I'm a chemist. We have to look at safety. Hydrogen is a much smaller molecule. It behaves in a different way. People hear hydrogen and they worry. I mean, it sounds, you know, sounds dangerous. The think is, though, natural gas. We've seen things on TV of when things go bad. But we've got the engineering know-how of how to make it all happen, but changing it has a price to it. Cost has been a huge hurdle for hydrogen. It's expensive to produce. More on how it's made in a moment. But first, Nina explains that there's still a big part of carbon emissions coming not only from transport, but also from how we heat and cook in our homes. In Europe, this mainly comes from a relatively cheap but also polluting fossil fuel, natural gas, also known as methane. How hydrogen's created is using either an electrical process or a gas treatment process. And it's expensive. But whilst renewable energy in the form of solar and wind now, everybody accepts that. Now this is quite an inexpensive way of getting power. It's not going to solve all the problems. It's made great headway in power, reducing our carbon emissions from power, because here in the UK, 33% of our power now comes from renewable sources. We've got the big issues around transport and also how we heat and cool our buildings. And there we have to wean ourselves off other forms of fossil fuel. Like here in the UK, 25 million homes are connected to the gas network. And that's burning methane. How do we change that? If we envisage that hydrogen then is the future, let's say, then what would a hydrogen home look like? Would it need completely new infrastructure? Would you need completely new piping works or an infrastructure to support that kind of an energy source? So like my home, I have no gas. I have solar. It's really efficient and I use everything as electric being powered from my solar panels. And then to heat it, people have ground source heat pumps or air source heat pumps. But it means that people have to live in a different way. You don't have hot radiators. You have to have it designed so you're enjoying an ambient different type of temperature. So we need an almost like a societal shift of the view of what they think is cozy. So it's a big journey we're on, but the challenge is there and the scientists and technologists are ready to rise to it. So could hydrogen one day replace natural gas for heating in our homes? Hi. Hi. Hello. Are you? We met in London. I'm meeting the PR man at the Italian gas company SNAM. It's Europe's largest gas pipeline company and the second largest in the world. Its CEO is Marco Alvera. I meet him in his spacious plush offices with views over Milan's suburbs. As we sit down, he shows me a copy of his new book, all about hydrogen. He has a radical vision, and it has hydrogen at its core. So we see a long-term future where there will be a lot of electrification, where Europe will source a lot of its solar energy from North Africa. If you put a solar panel in the Sahara, in Tunisia, in Morocco, in Libya, in Algeria, you get almost twice as much energy as if you put it in North Germany in the black forest. And this energy will be transported in the form of hydrogen. Hydrogen can be made from electricity and can be turned back into electricity. We can do it with the pipelines that exist already. To understand how this works, you need to know how hydrogen is made. So buckle up, here comes the science bit. How to make green or environmentally friendly hydrogen from renewable energy. So you generate electricity from renewables, which can be solar, which can be wind, and you use that electricity through electrolyzers to produce pure hydrogen. And just to be clear, electrolyzes, you're splitting water, you're taking the O out of the water and leaving the H, which is the hydrogen. Absolutely, absolutely. It's a very simple process. We've all done it at school if we took some scientific subjects at school. You can do it at home in a kit. It's very simple to do. You just need to add a current to water and some alkalization and you will get bubbles of oxygen and hydrogen splitting out. All this is a means to an end. The end game is to get hydrogen in the system. Why are we keen to get hydrogen in the system? Because hydrogen can be stored in a way that electricity cannot. So we can store hydrogen in the existing storage infrastructure. We can store hydrogen physically, it's a gas, in a salt cavern, at a fraction of the cost of storing electricity in a battery. The huge challenge for decarbonizing our energy system is how do we heat our homes in the winter, particularly in the northern hemisphere where we won't have a lot of sun. So you put the hydrogen in in the summer when you have more sun and you can take it out in the winter. Okay, the only problem I can see with this scenario that you're painting there is that where do you get the water from? I mean, we're talking about very dry countries in North Africa and you need the water to make the hydrogen. That's all into the calculations. You need to create water from seawater, so big desalienization plans. From an environmental point of view, once you use the hydrogen in a fuel cell, you're generating water again. And so the vapors would end up being water again. They would re-rain, so to speak. But while Marco evangelises about hydrogen as a way to save the gas industry in a world regulating against carbon emissions, the fact is almost all hydrogen is currently made from fossil fuels. It's not green, but grey. Nina Skorovska. To make hydrogen, you would take natural gas, liquefied natural gas. So ultimately fossil gas, the stuff that's not green, and you would process it with steam, and it would break CH4, a little bit of chemistry here, into hydrogen and CO2. And then you're left with hydrogen. And then that hydrogen, I would call that blue or even grey hydrogen, because it's come from a fossil fuel. This is the moment when hydrogen was injected into the Italian gas network by SNAM earlier this year. It was a world first. Marco Alvera's vision for hydrogen pipelines transporting solar electricity from North Africa might be a long way off. But this use of hydrogen, mixing a small amount with fossil fuel gas, instantly cutting its carbon footprint, is much closer to becoming reality. We've been able to test for a month the use of hydrogen inside two factories, one making pasta and one making mineral water down in southern Italy near Naples. So just to be clear, that means that the pasta in this factory was being cooked using hydrogen. Absolutely, that is true, a hydrogen blend. When you cook with hydrogen, is it like cooking with gas? I mean, how is it different? Does the hydrogen have a color? Does it have a smell? How does it work? Hydrogen is color-free and does not have a smell. And methane is, the chemical composition of methane is CH4, and the chemical composition of hydrogen is H. So you're simply adding H's to the C-H-4. So it's still methane for all intents and purposes. So the reason we were very keen to do this experiment is to show people that you can very safely burn hydrogen in existing infrastructure with no additional cost, with no harm, with no safety issues. To get the regulators comfortable and so that you don't need to look and readdress all the regulations. Was the hydrogen being used in this particular experiment that you did in southern Italy? Was it from renewables? No, it wasn't because very little hydrogen right now is produced from renewables. The incentives haven't been there to make it green. So it's what we very little hydrogen right now is produced from renewables. The incentives haven't been there to make it green. So it's what we call grey hydrogen. People listening might wonder, why are you putting hydrogen into the gas network if it's not coming from renewables? What difference does it really make to put that in that network? I mean, because it's kind of, someone would even say it's kind of like pretend decarbonizing. You're not really decarbonizing if the hydrogen was made using fossil fuels in the first place. Yeah, no, that is absolutely true. We have never said that our experiment is about decarbonizing itself. The experiment is about proving that you can put pure hydrogen in so that you can get a head start and prepare, pave the way for green hydrogen to be blended in. There's a lot of sectors that are very hard to decarbonize. I think of steel production, of glass, tiles, cement, heavy transport, airplanes, ships, lorries. The hard-to-abate sectors actually desperately need hydrogen. I think you'll find it's the oil and gas sector who are evangelizing for hydrogen because they can see a route of continuing to use fossil derivatives. There's a role for all the different types of fuel. There's no one silver bullet, a very overused phrase, I'm sure. You know, I've been in the game for a long time and we're so excited now that the world has woken up to the importance of renewable energy and there's still a lot to do just purely on renewables. Things we're working on is like how do we get the construction industry worldwide to design things that stop us relying on fossil fuel? You know, that's the first thing we should be doing before we spend lots and lots and lots of money of saying, well, let's put up with our old systems and create a hydrogen economy that's not really low carbon. On a busy street in Milan, thick with car traffic, I'm meeting Sauro Pasini for coffee. Do you want to have coffee? A coffee. Mr. Pasini is a veteran of the Italian energy industry. He helped set up the world's first hydrogen-fueled power plant here in Italy. It recently shut down. He's a hydrogen sceptic who's seen it all before. If you remember, there was a first period after the oil crisis in which hydrogen was an option. What year are we talking about that? 1970, 1980. And in which there was a thinking that hydrogen could be the fuel of the future. There were some testing. We had some cars. Then when the oil went down, everything dead. Money is always deciding which is the winning technology. Then, if you remember again when we started talking of the problem of CO2, early 2000. And we were thinking of using the conventional fuel, make hydrogen, take out the CO2, and this was a way of using the fossil fuels in a clean way, and at the same time, renewable was increasing, therefore it was natural to... And when you say renewables were increasing, you mean it was becoming more competitive? More competitive, correct, correct. And that was a bad news obviously for the hydrogen, because hydrogen wasn't as competitive. Correct. But now renewable are, let's say, making hydrogen real life, I would say, if it is... So, that's interesting, because renewables killed off hydrogen, you're saying in the early 2000s, but now the renewables, the fact that you can make hydrogen from renewable energy, wind energy, solar energy means that hydrogen is coming back again? Yes, the only important area in which I see the role of hydrogen is to use the almost free excess energy made by renewable to make hydrogen. And to do with hydrogen the most simple thing that is to use its energy, mixing it with the gas that we have in the network. So you're talking about the mixing of hydrogen in the gas network? Yes. That is a realistic thing to do. But what is the point if it's so little, if it's only, what, 2%, 3%, does it really make that much of a difference when it comes to air quality, when it comes to reducing carbon emissions? I agree with you, but this is something that we can do now. You mean it's better than nothing? Correct. It's an option that can be economically attractive now. Will it all be too little and too late for Venice? Back at the key side, Jane Damoso is thinking about the urgent need for action on climate change. Maybe one day hydrogen-powered boats will replace diesel-emitting ones along these Venetian canals to help save this sinking city. All these problems that Venice is facing tend to overpower any kind of narrative about the city. But one should also remember that the scale and size of Venice is perfect for implementing change it's possible and there's so much attention on Venice it's part of like the global imagination that if Venice could instead be part of demonstrating the solutions to so many global issues. Venice is like the canary in the mine. It shouldn't just be the symptom of this enormous problem, but Venice needs to propose itself as part of the solution.
