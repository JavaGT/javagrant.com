This podcast is supported by advertising outside the UK. This is the BBC. Welcome to the World of Business podcast. I'm Caroline Bailey. And in this week's download edition of In Business, I'm exploring the world of private tutoring, a sector that's experiencing unstoppable growth. private tutoring, a sector that's experiencing unstoppable growth. The noise here is incredible. I just can't really hear myself think. There are go-carts everywhere here at the UK's largest outdoor carting centre near Grantham in Lincolnshire. And Alex Huang is just putting his helmet on, ready for his first training session of the morning. It's all rather different, I have to say, from your average 15 year old school day. I'm Paul from Manchester and I'm Alex's private tutor and also personal trainer. That's because Alex doesn't go to school. He has Paul instead. Coming around now. Oh yeah, yeah, I can see him. Alex, you're coming around. Oh, with the orange helmet? Yeah, number 44. It's going so fast, I'm terrified just watching him. Welcome to the world of tutoring. I put my foot to the paddle, pedal to the floor. It's no longer an hour here or there after school to get a small minority of students through the 11 plus or their GCSEs or A levels. A hardworking teacher, earning a few pounds on the side in the run-up to exam time. Tutoring has become big business, with some of the very best earning a thousand pounds an hour and it's growing like never before. Some are even arguing that tutoring could change the face of education altogether. Hi, are you Alex? Hi, nice to meet you. So you've just come off the track now. Yeah, I've just come off. How did it go this morning? All right, the track's a bit slow to this morning, but we're just trying to get into the rhythm of things. We've got a race this weekend. So qualifying is tomorrow and the final start on Sunday. You are 15. How do you fit in your schoolwork around all this training and competing? I have a tutor, so I don't have to do normal school hours. You've got your tutor with you all the time working one to one. Yeah. Usually I spend Monday to Thursday doing work. That's still a lot less than you'd be doing if you were in a normal school. But I'm still learning the same things. Because it's one-on-one and it's not 20 or 30 students in a class, my tutor can condense it more because he knows me personally and he knows how I learn and he knows the best way to feed me the information. I do want to get into a good university. Talented wannabe Formula One drivers like Alex maybe at one end of the scale with their own private tutors, but it seems more and more families across the social divide are convinced that tutoring works and that one-to-one teaching can be a fast, effective way of transforming children's learning. The latest figures from the Educational Charity, the Sutton Trust, show that 27% of pupils at state secondary schools in England and Wales have had private tuition. That rises to 41% in London, and it's estimated that privately educated children are twice as likely to have a tutor as those at state schools. This sector is booming. And in this programme, I want to find out why that's happening. Diane Ray is Professor of Education at Cambridge University. When I started looking at private tuition, 25 years ago, it was something that happened at the GCSE stage of secondary schooling and also at the top of junior schooling, 9-10, 11-year-olds. But now we see private tuition among undergraduates at university and also in infant schools, even early years, nursery-aged children are being tutored. But why? It seems crazy. Tutoring is now seen as normative. It's what is perceived to be something that every good parent should provide for their child. Quite a startling thing to say. I mean, when I first started interviewing in working-class schools, working-class parents didn't mention tuition at all. It was totally off their radar. But now we see private tuition, not just among middle and upper-class parents, but increasingly among working-class parents. There's a sense that schools are no longer adequately resourced. Schools are no longer equipped to do the job properly and that parents increasingly need to compensate. And they are, in their droves. Usually it means a child going to a tutor after school or the tutor coming to the child's home. But there's now a newer concept, and that's tutoring centres, which are springing up on high streets across the UK. Explore learning is one of the big ones. Parents pay a joining fee of £50, and then £119 a month, which gives their children up to two sessions a week. Laura Gregson is the company's curriculum manager. We're inside Explore Learning in North Manchester, Heaton Park. We're actually based inside a Sainsbury store. Looking through the window here, I can see a huge Sainsbury's downstairs. Here you are right above. How many centres have you got? We've got 140 centres throughout the UK. And you're still expanding? We've got new centres opening all the time. Absolutely. Students of all ages are sitting at banks of computers. Headphones on, eyes glued to the screens. Everyone works at their own level and pace following maths and English computer programmes. In the background, young tutors hover, one to every six pupils, ready to help when needed. 14-year-old Maisha arrives for her session and logs on. So I'm going to do my reading. I do my reading now. I'm a success maker. It's like a video that it just parked you through. Then there'll be like questions that sort of linked to it. This is about the Cold War. It'll go green if you've got the right answer and if not it'll go red. Yep. Okay. And then sometimes it'll talk you through why it's wrong. Got the first one right. Oh, you're whizzing through these. Yeah. You get you to the habit and you through why it's wrong. Got the first one right. Well, you're whizzing through these. Yeah. You get into the habit and you really start to enjoy it. Maisha has been coming to explore learning for four years, sometimes once a week, sometimes twice. Her school results have improved significantly. She was struggling with maths, but now she's in the top set. Laura Gregson. The way it works is children attend on a flexible dropping basis. We stay open seven days a week. We stay open on a weekend and we open all day during the school holidays as well. You're expanding massively. You've got nine in Manchester, another one coming here. I mean, where's this demand coming from? We have a real mix of children, all ages and abilities. We start from age four, so from reception age, and then right through to their GCSE preparations as well. So, of course, we do have children that have an area that they may be struggling in, or an area of underconfidence, but we also have children that come to us because they're excelling at school, they love learning, and they want that real stretch and challenge outside of school as well as in school. But it is essentially computer-based learning. Lots of the work that the children are doing is computer-based. You are basically using a software package, aren't you? We do for the main lessons, we do, yes, we use Success Maker, and that basically acts almost like an interactive textbook. And what the computer does is it just basically provides the questions that are right for that child and their level and ability and then the tutor does all the teaching. There are of course endless computer programs available free of charge online but Explore Learning argues that it's about being in the right setting and having support. So what has created today's environment where parents feel the need to have their children tutored from the age of four, or during the school holidays, or for years on end? Whatever the educational view on this, one thing the experts agree on is that tutoring is here to stay. Lee Elliott Major, chief executive of the Sutton Trust, says he's concerned that while schools have made significant progress in narrowing the achievement gap, the tutoring industry is opening up a whole new divide. I've been calling this the educational arms race. This business, this tutoring obsession, has boomed very quickly. I would argue that this sort of shadow, if you like, education sector is the big divide in many ways. And in fact, what's happening is the divide is being driven outside the school gates. The Sutton Trust is all about trying to help disadvantaged children to get on within the education system. It's a losing battle at the moment, isn't it? I think our view is that you can't stop parents doing almost anything they can to get their children the best education. A lot of parents are anxious about the futures of their children and are putting more and more money and their time into making sure they get on. Lee Elliott Major argues that this divide is not just between those who can and can't pay for a tutor, but between exactly what kind of tutor families are able to afford. There is, he says, a complete hierarchy of tutoring. I think there's probably an assumption out there that if you just put a tutor in front of your son or daughter, that will help. That's not the case. It really does depend on who's doing the tutoring. We know it's very effective if you get a good tutor. It could be that you're spending a lot of money on someone who's not making that much difference. I think there's a lack of awareness of the variation in effectiveness, if you like, of that tutoring. You want to show me, first of all, want you show me what you can play? Nice. Mark McLean is one of the UK's most high-profile tutors with a formidable reputation. There's no computer learning here, just personalised one-to-one teaching. He tutors maths and science, and if his student is into football, then he'll use football to teach maths. If music's their thing, then as a former bass player, he's in his element. Now, did you know that there was a Greek philosopher called Pythagoras? What he found is, if you take the length of a string and you half it, the sound will actually go up an octave. Mark has tutored children of royal families, sports stars, film stars, musicians, but also children from all backgrounds and income levels. And the chemistry between him and his students is apparent. What's happening with these minus numbers here? It has to be an even amount of negatives for it to be a plus. Brilliant. If there's just say 12 negatives, then it will be a plus. Absolutely right. You just count up the negatives and see. Good work. But, but, look on... So essentially... Mark McLean is co-founder of a company called Tutor Fair, which currently has 3,000 tutors in the UK. He himself has notched up 20,000 hours of one-to-one tutoring. You are what's called a super tutor, I think. I don't know whether you like that term. And the sort of amounts you can earn as a super tutor, I mean, I've read up to £1,000 an hour. There have been instances where families have just offered huge amounts of money. I don't know whether it's a status thing of why I'm paying the most expensive tutor and they don't care what they're going to pay for it. How much? It can vary. My rates go right from free where I've got students who really wouldn't be able to afford tutoring and then it can go right up to £1,000 an hour. So at the top end, you're talking glitzy and one job can lead to another. At one point, one of the clients I was working with was the drummer and a really successful rock band and they recommended me to the British Royal Family and so after that I... The British Royal Family? Yeah so there's lots of... Any more details there for us? I... yeah I'm not trying to sidestet the question. Okay so I wasn't going to get any further with that question. But alongside life as a super tutor, Mark is passionate about offering help to more ordinary families, including those who can't afford tutoring. Tutor fares fees include a donation for their charity arm, which sends volunteer tutors into schools to teach children who need extra help but would never be able to pay for private tuition. I wasn't great in school. I'm dyslexic. I grew up in a council of state and there was very little support for me when I was younger. So each year I take on some students who don't pay anything. The school system works for the majority of people, but the truth is there are tons of people who are left behind. We were very happy 30 or 40 years ago that only sort of 20 or 30% of students excel, you know, within the school system. And I think people are starting to move in the direction of saying, well, you know what, actually, I can now do something about it. Mark's results are impressive. He talks of students whose exam grades have jumped after a fairly limited burst of his tutoring. But he's not unique in that. He says tutoring doesn't have to be expensive, although at times experience can really pay off. Parents often ask me what kind of level tutor should I go for? And one of the big things I say to them is that an experienced tutor might actually end up saving you money in the long run. When I started out tutoring, I didn't know what I was doing. So I know that there are topics, for example, quadratic equations in maths that used to take me an entire lesson. And now, actually, I can get to the core of what's going on with the quadratic within about five minutes. If you want really quick results or you really want to deal with a specific issue, sometimes hiring a slightly more expensive tutor can be much more efficient. That may be the case, but eye-watering amounts of money are being spent on tutors by people who can barely afford it. And this is where this growing free market in education becomes more sinister. Selina Chowdhury and her husband both work in a supermarket. She was determined their son would get into a state grammar school. But to achieve that, she knew he would need extra help. And that meant whatever it took to pay for a tutor. He used to go twice a week. And then when there was a school holidays, he used to go like five times a week. And how much do you think you spent? Roughly £1,600? £1,600? Yeah, yeah. How did you do that? I would go for any overture whatsoever was available at that time. Sometimes I even work like seven days a week. Anything, yeah, anything. And that was in order to pay for the tuition? Yeah, and when there was none, I had to go for the credit cards. You had to go back to the good friend credit card. That's how we managed. Did you feel you had to do this? Personally, I was thinking if he didn't go past all those tests, I might be categorized as like not a good mom. Like every single whoever I know in my social network and everything, they all kind of went for it. Selena is a perfect example of the pressure many parents feel to get a tutor for their children, whatever their income. If everyone's doing it, it's hard to resist. For Selena, it's about wanting a better life for her son and daughter than she has had. I don't want my children to be having this kind of retail job or like we want our children to be successful. Professionally, you'd like them? Professionally, yeah. And you're hoping that their life will be easier? I think so. I hope so. I hope so, yeah. That's all the sacrifices are for. I was willing to do anything for my children. They're going to have a secure job, a secured life, a well-balanced life. You'll be relieved to hear that Selena's son did get into the grammar school. The tutor industry thrives on parents' fears for their children's future in today's competitive world, on their hopes and ambitions, and on an unwillingness to simply leave it all to their school. This can, of course, be seen as undermining the teaching profession, but at a time when school budgets and workloads are at breaking point and teachers are leaving at an alarming rate, is tutoring actually filling a crucial gap? Teachers themselves are in high demand as tutors. The latest government figures show that last year more teachers left the classroom than entered the profession. How many, I wonder, would be tempted away by job offers like these? An able and experienced educator, bilingual in English and Japanese, required for tutoring a boy aged 12, based in Japan, with a move to America likely. Salary, $225,000 per annum. Or this one, in Bermuda. Full-time tutor required after school and weekends. The student is an energetic, competitive, 13-year-old boy who's an excellent sailor. The tutor should be adventurous and engaging and their natural curiosity for the world around them should be infectious. Salary, 108,000 pounds per annum. Or if Europe is more up your street, this one in Padua, Italy. An experienced and capable educator required for a 13-year-old girl. The tutor will be required to teach to a standard of excellence sufficient for entry to a top-class, British or American school. Salary £148,000 per annum. This really is high-end, mega-salary tutoring. All these jobs were advertised by a company called Tutors International. It finds full-time tutors, almost always qualified teachers, to work for individual families all over the world. Back at the go-carting track, Paul, Alex's tutor, is one of those who's been lured away from teaching by Tutors International. I don't want disparage teaching, I love teaching, and maybe I'll go back into it. It's just, I think after about eight years being a teacher in formal education, I just wanted to change. It is rather different from teaching in a school, isn't it? Yeah, it's completely different. If you look at the outside, you look at the glamour, but actually rather different from teaching in a school, isn't it? Yeah, it's completely different. If you look at the outside, you look at the glamour, but actually when we go into Alex's classroom, it's very similar. And the work has to be done. You have to get the best out of the student. You have to relay information. You have to inspire. So it's actually the skills you learn as a teacher are very transferable. I've been to places and I've eaten food that I may not have eaten before. So as a working class boy, yeah, it's quite glamorous. Where have you been? All around the world. And the money, there's no comparison with teaching in a school, is there? Yeah, that's a thing, but that's the market. You know, there's a market and there's and demand, and you fit in where you can. Have you double, trebled, quadrupled your salary? Let's not talk about that. Adam Caller is the founder and director of Tutors International, and he recruited Paul. He takes the job of finding the right tutor for the right family very seriously, which can involve staying with them for up to a week. The money is excellent, of course, compared to salaries in schools. There's no expenses, really, so everything they earn is potentially saving. They see the wealth, they see the exposure to places they couldn't hope to go to, they see travel on private jets, they see big yachts. If you can do a job at £90,000 a year for one of my clients and have more or less no expenses for, say, three or four years, you will save potentially two or three hundred thousand pounds. How long would you have to work in a school to save two or three hundred thousand pounds? Never. You could never do it. You're looking at highly qualified teachers. Are you poaching them from British schools? I don't call up teachers in schools and say, do you want to leave your comfortable job in this very good school and come and do this? I advertise a position and people apply for it. I'm a recruiter. I advertise positions and I recruit teachers for those positions. And I think I am taking very good teachers out of schools. For now, the numbers are pretty small. Adam Caller has 54 tutors in positions around the world and he says most of the teachers who've worked for him do go back to the classroom later. But it's hard to see how this wouldn't be a growth area for overworked teachers, attracted by the freedom, the exotic locations, and of course the salary. I think that most people who work for us are motivated by the need, a personal need, to do more than a school allows them to do. Schools constrict teachers to a few subjects and the politics of working alongside their colleagues and the enormous amount of paperwork. And when you're a tutor, you're freed from all of those things. And I have a tutor, for example, who has been working for us for a number of years. And right now she's doing a job where she's homeschooling 15 IGCSC subjects by herself. And she doesn't have to answer to anybody. She can interrelate the subjects as she sees fit. This is just one child she's tutoring. Yes. She can choose the equipment she needs. She's got more or less unlimited budget on resources. She can have whatever equipment she wants in the classroom. If she were to suggest to the family that it might be better to learn about the Egyptians in Egypt, they would go to Egypt rather than looking at it in a book or on video on YouTube. Well, that's pretty great for a teacher, isn't it? It is. It's fantastic, yes. While tutoring is a fast-growing sector, estimated to be worth up to two billion pounds in the UK, it is completely unregulated. There are no offstead school inspectors sniffing around. You don't need teaching experience. There are no legal checks and many are recommended by word of mouth. In fact, anyone could set themselves up as a tutor. And lots of students offer private tuition to help them through their studies. I caught up with friends James Simpson and Alana Mullen in a very noisy pub in Manchester. They're brimming with enthusiasm, if not totally relevant experience. James and Alana, you're both at Manchester. What are you doing? I study physics with astrophysics and I'm in my final year. I'm doing an MSC in nuclear science and technology. I started off as a geography tutor. Even though I only did geography GCSE myself, so that was a bit stressful. I was just reading one line ahead of this kid as I was trying to... Do you think you should be telling us that, James? Well, it's all about honesty, isn't it? But that was only a short-term fix because he had a test coming up. He just wanted a bit of help for a test. I've done English, literature and language. of help for a test I've done English literature and language I've done maths I've done physics I've done science in general I've done chemistry and I also did hang on your degree is in astrophysics and you're tutoring English language and literature there's a lot there's a lot transferable skills but yeah how much you earning stowing rate is about 25 pounds per hour it's better than waitressing better than than bar work yes it's completely different work obviously pay wise per hour it's great thing is with with bar work you're going to work longer shifts aren't you so in terms of absolute cash earned you could probably earn a similar amount but if you're on a tight schedule and you know i know i'm supposed to be studying a lot that's what i say um it's a cash earned, you could probably earn a similar amount, but if you're on a tight schedule, you know, I know I'm supposed to be studying a lot, that's what I say. It's a good way of earning money in quite a short time. Yeah. Joking aside, James and Alana both say their students' grades went up as a result of their tutoring. The evidence that tutoring works seems compelling. So is it time to look at bringing it into mainstream education? A wide-ranging study at the University of Chicago has attracted great interest internationally. Boys in some of the poorest schools in the city who'd fallen behind were given extra tuition in school and the results were staggering. John Wolfe, Associate Director for Education at the University's Crime and Education Labs, was part of the research team. The schools that we targeted and the students that we targeted were students who are struggling academically, who may be two, three, four, or five years behind in their math performance. And so we targeted those neighborhood schools in traditionally disadvantaged neighborhoods in the city of Chicago. Every day for a year, they had 50 minutes with a tutor in pairs. What we find after a year of tutoring, find really remarkable results on a couple different areas. The biggest impact that we saw was on math test scores. So when we looked at the standardized tests that 9th and 10th grade boys take here in Chicago public schools, we see that students who participate in the tutoring program got an additional one to two years of learning on top of what a regular ninth grader would be expected to learn. And we also see a reduction not only in the math course failures, but we also see a reduction in non-math course failures. So even though this is math tutoring, students who are participating in the program, we also see a reduction in failures in all non-math course subjects. So that's English and science and history. Tutoring is inevitably expensive and well beyond the budgets of most schools. But John Wolfe argues that compared to the amount already invested in the education of these struggling children, paying for a tutor to bring them up to speed so they leave school with good results does make financial sense in the long run. The Chicago research is being followed up elsewhere in the US, in the Netherlands and in the UK, where the Sutton Trust has conducted similar trials. In fraction land, it's almost as if the whole thing's been flipped on its head. At tutor fair, Mark McLean also wants to use his tutoring charity to level the playing field. He's convinced of the value of one-to-one teaching. He believes the time has come for more collaboration between the teaching profession and the tutoring sector. We've helped nearly 10,000 students over the last five years, and that's really exciting. I mean, the truth is, I think we can help way more. You know, is there a way that teaching and, you know, and tutoring can work together? Absolutely there is. I think the long-term goal at the foundation is to transform the education system and support the students who otherwise wouldn't be able to get tutoring. Like a small intervention can make a huge difference in the long run. Even 15 minutes at the moment when a student falls behind could save hundreds of hours years later when that's cumulatively had a real detriment to their education. It seems that tutoring is being normalized. Until recently, considered the preserve of the well-off and a means of gaining unfair advantage, it now reaches further, but not equally, across the social spectrum. As a business sector, there is clearly unstoppable demand and money to be made by both companies and individuals alike. But the wider challenge concerns its potential as a mainstream educational tool, and whether it can be used to bring the benefits so far afforded to a privileged few to a broader majority.
