This podcast is supported by advertising outside the UK. There are plenty of stereotypes bandied about various countries and nationalities. That goes both ways. The French call the Brits Leiros Bif, or when feeling less generous, they might refer to the UK as Perfide Albion. So after these last years of political uncertainty, what is Britain's reputation abroad and does it need a little polishing? I'm John Murphy, the producer of this in-business program. With my colleague Chris Bulby, we went to find out. You need to go inside. Sure. Very distinctive atmosphere here. You can see panamas, trillbies, umbrellas and a grandfather clock very impressively in the corner. I'm sorry, Roger would be within a few moments but I can take you to the heritage room and he'll meet you there. For an example of the history of great British brands, here is a pretty good place to start, Locke and Co, the world's oldest hat sellers who've been selling fashionable headwear from St James's in central London for centuries. Roger, very good to meet you. Very nice to meet you too. And this is quite a room. Well, thank you very much. This is our heritage room. So it's some of our artifacts and bits and bobs from over the years. These are some of our artifacts and bits and bobs from over the years. These are some of our famous head shapes. The good and the great of Lockencoe, you might say, through the years. So yes, people like Charlie Chaplin, of course, famously wore our bowler hats. And then, you know, even some of the slightly weird ones, we have Lord Lucan hiding down there. Still being sought. Still being sought. Still being and his hats yes oh Harold Wilson former British Prime Minister Harold Wilson famously Winston Churchill and we have the Churchill ledger on display in our cabinet over here so that shows some of the hats he had from us before and during the war Princess of Wales is David Libyan Henry Winkler American Act of the Fons. Alex James from Blur. And it's lovely to have this. This is evolving all the time. We're having new people coming in. It's a nice archive for us, really. And you're a company with a real history going back to when? 1676. So we're 343 years old. And we are still a family-owned business. And I am the seventh generation of my family to be involved with the business. That's extraordinary. So a real sense of continuity of surviving through thick and thin? Very much so, without sort of feeling smug because you never know what's around the corner but we have survived a few wars and depressions and recessions and changing of governments and all the rest of it and you feel like we're still soldiering on you might say. Soldering on, surviving through thick and thin, retaining a reputation for reliability and quality, a characteristics British brands like this have long enjoyed. But for in business this week, I'm asking whether our global reputation and image have taken a costly knock and need repair after several years of national instability. Or can we find new ways of exploiting what comes to mind when many think of Britain? For some, Britain's primarily about tradition. For others, it's quirky cleverness and best-selling literature. Elementary, my dear Watson. The name Sherlock Holmes and the address is 221B Baker Street. Afternoon. Holy cricket! You're Harry Potter! Humour and eccentricity is another selling point perhaps, Frickett, you're Harry Potter. Humour and eccentricity is another selling point perhaps, provided we don't become a laughing stock. This parrot is no more. Don't panic! Don't panic! And Brits themselves might hope the world sees them as suave, world-saving sophisticates. The name's Bond. James Bond. And then there's... Order! Order! And that's where things have become trickier. Mind for the gap. What used to be thought of as fundamental political stability backed by an open, reliable legal system, well, that's been looking like the Houses of Parliament in need of urgent repairs. This is not just about image or culture. It's about things that have made Britain a positively attractive place to do business, as well as to visit, study or buy products. So how does business view the British image now, and what's needed by way of a refrable? active place to do business, as well as to visit, study or buy products. So how does business view the British image now and what's needed by way of a refashioning that combines, like a good hat, the best of tradition, with an eye for contemporary appeal? There's a hat being steamed behind us. The steam coming out of a kettle-like contraption, just being very shaped expertly. We're now a very careful brushing around the brim and the band. It's still shaping all the time. It's a bit like moulding pottery in some ways. It just brings the nap at the felt out really nicely so it just brings it up. Do you think of yourselves as representing an essence of Britain? I would say so, yes. I mean, we get international visitors here and they come to us because I think one we're unique and I think especially this part of London there's so many great independent shops that bring a flavour and it's something you don't get in other cities that individuality you might say and do you worry at all about the last few years and britain's reputation people coming whether they want to come what they think of as the essence of britain the stability the reliability yeah it is a concern i think the whole political climate we have in at the moment with all the Brexit negotiations. I think that has damaged Britain new PLC brand. You know, I don't think we quite have the same standing we used to have a few years ago. I'd like to think it will come back. As I say, when you come through that door, Lord Nelson walk through that door. It's the same door. Churchill walk through that door, it's the same door, Churchill walk through that door. There's some mystique there. So where does all this leave the idea of UK PLC or Great Britain? Global brands that until a few years ago seemed an easier sell, even if they often glossed over the problems the UK as a whole was facing. Hello. Hello. This is Chris and John. Hello, good for me too. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. We've moved east across London to Shoreditch now, hotbed of tech and advertising, a hyper trendy place that believes it truly understands what sells in the modern world. You are at an agency called Radley Elder. We looked after the great campaign for five years between 2012 and 2017, which effectively made as Britain's brand agency, if you like, for that time. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to London and to the Games of the 30th Olympiad. Mike Oliver worked directly on the Great Campaign, an attempt to boost the value of Britain's reputation at a time of national pride and optimism as the country hosted the 2012 Olympics. 2012, we can look back on it quite nostalgically now, can't we? There's a kind of a high water mark in terms of the country feeling extremely proud about itself. But certainly, from 2012 for the next couple of years I think the campaign promoted above all a confidence about what we're about the objectives were to promote Britain as a tourist destination promote Britain as an investment centre and also promote it as a place where you'd want to come and study as a student around us on the wall are these posters in your campaign what's interesting is kind combination, if you like, of the modern, the contemporary and the traditional. The idea was to show how Britain is great now, and how it can play to its heritage, surely, but the idea was to promote it as a creative hub more than anything else. There was a lot of messaging about entrepreneurialism, about innovation, about technology, etc. All tying in one way or another to a sense of us being the creative hub of the world, if you like. Yeah, you've got, I can see posters over there, one saying innovation is great, one saying heritage is great, and over there, technology is great, food's great, business is great. So a lot of contemporary notes to that. Yeah, just saying we're great is one thing, but showing evidence of all shapes and size is another. So the innovation is great, a poster you can see there, is actually highlighting the retractable roof at Wimbledon, showing that we were one of the first countries to be able to do that. It's not just about inspiring the world that this is a great place, but it's actually showing them in the evidence at the same time. There's hard evidence, argue the advertisers, that an improved national brands delivered several billion pounds worth of benefit in, say, product sales or inward investment. It may be difficult to separate such claims from other factors, such as the value of sterling, which shape Britain's business appeal. But it's clear an image as positive as it was in 2012 can bring benefits. Whereas now, says Mike Oliver, you'd have to think about marketing Britain in a rather different atmosphere. I think if you went straight into 2020, putting a lot of effort and money behind the Britain's great campaign to the outside world, my personal feeling is it would probably met with a lot of cynicism and quite a lot of, you know, tittering because obviously what's gone on for the last four years. So I think it needs to go through a process to reassert itself and to gently take people on a journey to tell them that we're open for business, always have been, always will be. Just had a little bit of a blip everybody, but now we're back. But to get there, I think you need to go on a little bit of our journey with them. And we'll leave Mike Oliver for now to ponder how he'd market the UK today. More from him later. Meanwhile, what about the current views of the target audience, those we want to attract to trade with, invest in, or just visit Britain? Hi, you're here for a tour? What's your name, please? Tourists are gathering to see some of London's most famous historical sites. Down by the Mall, working to ancient routines, there's plenty of pomp and tradition. Britain's famous for its fashion industry and theatre as well as its royalty, and they all merge here in the changing of the guard, carefully choreographed with plenty of exotic uniforms and, yes, that unique British headware style on show here too, even if we did take it originally from abroad. Waterloo, yeah, it's quite Hollywood action, it's quite good fun. It's a good battlefield to visit as well, and it does give us the bear-skin hats. Actually, those came from the French. Specifically, the French Imperial Guard. Tour guide Andy skillfully weaves in history, celebrity and royal gossip for his eager audience from Taiwan, Australia and the United States. I'm from Chicago in the US. Oh, I'm from Buffalo, New York in the United States. When you think of Britain, what do you think of first? What's your image? I think today it's the Brexit, the leading of the European Union. And I think for me it's the royalty and the tradition and the history. Do you think people's image has changed in the last few years as they watch what's been happening here? Yes, absolutely. And I think, as my friend said, the Brexit has a big influence on the world's perception of what the United Kingdom is all about. I don't think Grand Britain is in trouble, but we've certainly given ourselves an enormous knock over the last few years. Helen Brocklebank is acutely sensitive to the commercial value of Britain's reputation as the chief executive of Walpole. Wallpole is the organisation that promotes, protects and develops the business of luxury in the UK, and that's a business that's worth £48 billion to the UK economy. Her organisations linked to exports ranging from Rolls-Royce and Bentley cars to Wedgewood ceramics, Scottish whiskeys, sparkling wines, top hotels and fashion houses like Burberry. These brands currently want more certainty about what's going to happen post-Brexit. But have recent years harmed our future image? Strangely enough, Helen says a sense of British doggedness and eccentricity might offer reassurance. I think the sense that Britain is a country that likes to paddle its own canoe is really helpful. But no matter what, you know, we keep on going. I mean, what's that Churchill expression, keep buggering on? And the maverick nature of Britishness. You know, on the one hand, we are seen to be incredibly traditional with the royal family and the kind of pinstripe suits and all those things that seem, afternoon tea, things that seem a bit cliched to us. But on the other, we're also seen to be deeply eccentric and that sense of maverickness that we will invent things and look outwards. So I think that keeps the appeal of Britain quite high, even in difficult times. I'm not at Tavisoli. I was born in Hamburg, Germany, to a German mother and an Iranian father. And I've lived in various places, including the US, as you can tell by the accent, but also Australia, France, Spain, and England before the latest dent here at the London Business School. Someone whose international background gives him a special ability to understand how Britain's perceived is branding expert and professor of marketing, Nada Tavasoli. And his particular interest is how far Britain's seen as an attractive place to move to, whether for business or study. It's this idea of am I welcome. We see it with students applying from Europe. There's a question, are we welcome here to study? So it's that emotional connection. And, you know, we keep on talking about treaties and monies and all that rational stuff, which at the end of the day, yes, it matters, but that's just the foundation. What really matters is, you know, this openness. And I think preserving that throughout this turmoil is important. Foreign students have become a big British business worth billions. In fees they pay, the accommodation that's built for them, the family visits they attract. And then there's the British schools and universities selling their brand with campuses abroad. How much is all this affected by the country's overall reputation? They're intimately related both ways, right? The way people view Great Britain, sometimes they experience Great Britain through the products they consume. So I think all of these things are wrapped up and a brand is really the set of associations people have in their head. Alfred Hitchcock once famously said, you cannot emote if you're confused, if the audience is confused. And people are asking themselves, what is Great Britain? How would my experience be in London? And what does it mean for me? Though there's far more to the country and its reputation than just the symbols and businesses based in the capital. I've recently moved back to live in North East England and enjoy visiting one of my favourite places the Granger Market in Newcastle. The specialist tripe shop may have gone, but it's full of small businesses selling everything from fish and fruit to industrial workware and posh coffee. And it's also full of forthright opinions about, say, Britain's reputation. Well, at the minute, stupid. Before all this carry on about Brexit and everything, I think people loved coming to England and that. They loved were heritage, their history and everything. But now it's just a charm, isn't it? Do you think our image has changed? Yeah, I do. I do. Because I think we're stupid. We can't organise nothing. Can't sort anything out. What do you think Britain's reputation is around the world now? What do people think of when they think of Britain? Poor. Poor. Can't make their minds up. They used to like coming here. Now they can't say the point there anymore. Retail here, like retail everywhere, is struggling with changing shopping habits and online competition. But this has always been a resilient place and surprisingly international, as the range of food on sale testifies. When I first lived here in the 1970s, there were hundreds of regular visitors from Scandinavia and the Netherlands. And in one place, a CD and vinyl store, manager Dave Wheeler told me they can still do well, trading on Britain's reputation for good music. And how's business? It's fine. it's great actually, with the recent sort of revival and vinyl interest. We found that we're selling at least as much vinyl as we are CDs. It helps keeps things nice and buoyant. And in terms of the customers who come, it's become more international, hasn't it? Well, this store's always been international. Even when we just did CDs, we had visitors from Holland and visitors from Scandinavia, saying that, oh, we haven't got anything like this in our country, and they still don't, it seems. But they buy lots of this stuff, which is great for us. And this is one of the things that Britain's known for around the world, isn't it, it's music? Yeah, despite all the elections and Brexit and we still have a very healthy music scene. And do you think that's going to be part of Britain's reputation in the future as well? That just won't change? Yeah, I think it has been that since we've had in the 1950s, and I don't think it'll ever subside. And in terms of the northeast in particular, it's northeast of England, its reputation, when people think of Britain, they might think of places a long way away from here. Does the northeast have a particular image around the world that it can make use of? Well, I think people love the Jory accent no matter where you live in the world. You know, we get people coming across here like I say from Scandinavia and from Holland they say what a great dialect you have. Say something and Joanie. He say, where you are man, it's great how we're here man? And the laugh, oh that's fantastic you know. Maybe you should get the rest of the country speaking more like that? Absolutely yes, let's start a petition. How are we should get the rest of the country speaking more like that? Absolutely, yes. Let's start a petition. How are we in a Britain man? How are you? Attractive accents and good music sales won't sustain a whole economy. And in this major exporting region there's much anxiety about trade wars and the future of Britain's European links. But along the River Tyne, one of the North East's three great rivers that made the region globally famous, the mood's not as universally depressed as you might assume. The port of Tyne still links the area with a fast-changing world of commercial opportunity as well as competition. We're well-kitted up now. We've got the right footwear on, we've got hard hats, we've got high viz and we're on the south bank of the River Tyne. So Lucy, introduce yourself. Tell us exactly what you do here. I'm Lucy, I'm strong and I'm privileged enough to be the chair of the Port of Time. Gives us an idea here of the range of activities that are going on in the Port of Time. So we range from the cruises, over the summer, 59 cruises, through to a good chunk of the wood pellet that powers about 12, 14% of the UK's electricity. We also have a huge business in automotive, exporting every Nissan car that's produced in the UK, that's about 400,000 a year, importing lots of items that go into the makeup of Nissan cars. And from where we're standing, you can see across to the north side, and that's a big depot for VW imports into the UK, right next to our daily ferry that goes to Amsterdam. So this is a thoroughly global place, you could say? Truly global place, yes. I mean, you're looking at a ship that looks to me like it's from China, but it's bringing wood pellet from Louisiana or from Canada. The Nissan ship behind us that you can see over my right shoulder. It says city of Rotterdam, but I can almost guarantee it's probably going to Russia and it's probably come from Shanghai. Tyneside, which once pioneered everything from railways and shipping to electric light and turbines, knows its reputation stands or falls on practical achievement. Brexit's certainly posing some urgent questions for how a port like this prospers in the short to medium term. But as we continued our tour of the port complex by van, I found Lucy Armstrong's also focusing on even more profound longer term change. We've certainly found that life has got tougher. It's got tougher for a number of reasons. One is the uncertainty around Brexit. A second one is the major shift from diesel in cars. That's had a big impact on car demand in the West and that's impacted us because Nissan are an important customer. If you have a good or a bad harvest. So global trends are hugely important here and they spread over vast time horizons. So we are thinking about the fact that the Arctic is going to be a new global trading route by 2040, which is only 20 years away. So we are planning now for how the Tyne and all the North East ports will be best positioned. Lucy's well aware that for many climate change is an overwhelmingly negative development. Pollution caused by shipping itself is a major cause of that change. And the port here, she says, aims to be an all-electric carbon neutral operation by 2030, just as the River Tine is developing as a major centre for new green technologies. Lucy Armstrong also works with a number of other businesses in the region. How do they feel recent uncertainty will best be overcome in dealings with the outside world? Britain's been a trading nation for literally thousands of years. We are going to remain an island, we're going to remain temperate, we're going to have Greenwich meantime, and you don't suddenly become a marine nation. It takes hundreds of years probably to build up that expertise and knowledge base and also social acceptance as well that heavy, chunky, smelly, dusty things need to be looked after, need to be handled, you need expertise to do that, you need a willing population to allow you to do that. Heavy, chunky, smelly, industrial products, that you need a willing population to allow you to do that. Heavy, chunky, smelly industrial products seem a long way away back in London amidst the neat boxes and expensive fabrics of Hatter's Lock and Co. Here too, says Roger Stevenson, there's an inheritance you can build on, but you have to move with the times, exploiting what's new and trendy, like a popular TV show. The Peeky Blinder effect keeps on running. And we should just explain this as a TV series about gangs based in Birmingham who conceal razor blades in their hats. And not the kind of thing you might expect to be a great marketing tool. But that eight-piece cap is a very stylish headware. Some people call it a baker boy cap. We call it an eight-piece cap. It's made from eight panels. It's become very fashionable and that's really exciting for us. And when people actually come in and say, oh, I saw this thing on a TV series, can you do something like that? Can I have a peaky blinder cap? Is what we hear all the time. It's amazing. So I think being a specialist and really understanding your product, really understanding your customer, I think we'll count for something for years to come. Vicious gangs clad in peaky blinder caps isn't exactly a reassuring new national image. More reassuring for some would be a boost from another recent TV hit, Downton Abbey's version of aristocratic life. Traditionalists might also hope that old images are Scottish romance, or Welsh cultural pride, remain attractive and lucrative, though the Scots and Welsh will certainly have more modern images of their creativity and dynamism to promote. And branding expert Nada Tavasoli warns against a dangerous temptation, assuming that heritage alone will keep a country globally attractive. If you're too focused on the history, you become a dusty brand. I'm not sure Britain's become dusty at all, but because the identity was so much influenced by being part of the EU and being European, and if you take that away, you have to redefine what the British identity is. You have no choice. And if you define it just by taking things away, it's going to be lesser. So the question is what fills that gap, what fills that vacuum, and what in the heritage can you rely on and make relevant to fill that gap? So I think culture, the arts, technology, business, those are all channels by which to build and maybe rebuild the image of Great Britain. And in her channel, along the Tyne, Lucy Armstrong sees the Great British Maritime reputation rebuilt too, but only if it keeps pace with enormous change in the way business, all business is done. So we're indoors now and we've come to something called the innovation hub. What's the idea behind this? So what's really clear to us is that whilst we'll be moving things from water to land and land to water, that's going to carry on, and probably in a similar fashion, everything else about what the port does will be different. Data analytics will be crucial. Managing supply chains, enabling our customers beyond the port, where we can have an effect that makes their life easier, makes it faster, makes it more streamlined. Let's say a food stuff is in a ship and it's maturing as it moves. Do they speed the ship up? Do you then give it priority for coming in? How do you monitor that? How then do you get it straight to a supermarket? Those kinds of things are what are going to happen. Technology is changing and particularly the use of data means this has to accelerate massively. If we just carry on doing what we normally do, we won't be here in five, ten years' time. And actually, we were the first to industrialise, we're the first to move to a service industry, we must be the first to move to a green economy, and we must be the first to move to a data economy. Britain runs this argument, can restore its reputation with a shrewd combination of tradition and innovation. But any amount of optimism can't simply wave away like a branded Harry Potter wand, the turbulence of recent years. Advertising executive Mike Oliver, who helped shape the campaign to celebrate Great Britain following the 2012 Olympics, says the approach today would certainly be different. You could be looking at it in a variety of different ways. I think one way you could look at it is to start thinking about it as a more internally focused brand. To re-inject pride into a country that's spent four years shouting at itself, I think is an opportunity. I think there's a message about we're still open for business, we're still an open, diverse society, that we're still open thinkers. I'm sorry about the last four years, etc. But I think to get there, it could probably do with a little bit of tender sort of domestic care first. But I think in a 2020 world, showing the people of Britain that all of Britain counts, from the tiniest village to the biggest metropolis, etc. And that can be extraordinary well-known things, but it also can be, you know, whatever, Mrs. Miggins's tea shop in Devon as well. You know, all that sort of stuff, I think would be something worth exploring. For a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down, the medicine go down. So as the UK attempts this year to move decisively on from the instability of the Brexit process, it wants to present a new face to the world. Famous brands, tradition, the reach of British culture and language can all still help. With no amount of political rhetoric or slick advertising can change the reality of business and trading conditions on the ground. Pragmatic appeal, not just sugar-coated PR, is what can really keep British business globally healthy. In Business was presented by Chris Bulby. The producer was me, John Murphy.
