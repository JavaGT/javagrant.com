Welcome to the BBC's World of Business podcast. I'm Caroline Bailey. In this edition, I'll be asking just what the secrets are behind Germany's exporting success and how it became Europe's economic powerhouse. Okay, there's a detour. I have to start my tom-tom. If I have guests from foreign countries and they ask to visit those hidden champions companies, I tell them don't go to Berlin, come here to this rural province in South Germany. Winfred Weber is a professor of management and a business consultant. He's also my guide driving me through this region of Baden-Vurttemberg. And we're just passing here some wineyards and you don't expect to find here some companies from the heart of the German world-class industry, but they just are in between those valleys in these hills. Businesses nestling in the lush green countryside, making things to export all over the world. But 15 years ago, the German economic miracle, which saw the country rebuild its economy after the Second World War, was looking extremely jaded. By the early 2000s it was called the sick man of Europe. But fast forward to today and it's a very different story for Europe's largest economy. Germany weathered the 2008 world economic crisis better than many. Unemployment levels are now at their lowest since reunification, business confidence is high and exports are booming. Our drive through the countryside leads us to the historic town of Vertheim. Winfried, why did you bring us to this region? We're sitting in a historical marketplace, but in the middle of the countryside. You said it would help us understand the strength of the German economy. Why? Well, we are here at the backbone of the German economy. So such an area is very rural, but you find here a very high concentration of world-class middle-stand companies in relation to the population. And we're talking here about the German Middlestrand. Tell me what that is. A Midlstrand company is privately owned, mostly family business in the first, second, third, eighth generation. And this area has a concentration of world-leading companies in sectors like mechanism to open the windows or explosion protection technologies or designed and high-tech thermos. So thermos for your coffee? Yes. Yes. So really we're talking about very niche products and many of them people simply wouldn't have heard of. That's it. So they are really hidden. The link is quality and the niche. 99% of all German companies are small and medium-sized businesses, about 3.3 million of them, and they make up the middle stand. Strictly speaking, they would have fewer than 500 employees, but it's a term that goes much deeper and has come to define a business mindset. Winfried Weber describes himself as a Middlestan champion. He's a professor at Mannheim University of Applied Sciences, and he travels the world, lecturing, and brings business delegations from South Korea in China here to the heart of the German middlestand, to see what he argues is the reason for Germany's success. Many countries would say that they've got small and medium-sized companies. What's different about Germany's middle stand? The difference in Germany is that a lot of those small and medium-sized companies doing exports from the beginning. So they try to be in front of the innovation, find and define a niche, then sell it on an international level. In Germany we have only 28 of the global 500 biggest companies. Only 28 of them are the big German brands like Daimler, Siemens or Volkswagen. But we have around 48% of those small world market leaders. So although Germany has some big name global companies, there aren't that many of them, given the size of the economy. What it does have, though, is a very high proportion of so-called hidden champions, medium-sized companies which are global market leaders. Hello? called Hidden Champions, medium-sized companies which are global market leaders. Hello. Hello. We're looking for the CEO and we think we've come by the factory floor. No one's stopped us so far. Caroline Bailey. Yeah, I'm Gabriella Koenig. Sorry, I think I was some confusion with the parking. Gabriella Cernick is the boss of Kernick and Maya, which makes music stands. If you're a musician, you've probably used one of them. Gabriella is slim with shortly cropped dark hair and glasses. She fizzes with energy and enthusiasm. And once we find her, we set off together to visit the company's main factory, a short car ride away. Heading out to the car park, we bump into her father on his way in. Do you still work in the company? A little bit. He's 81 years old. So you're retired? And your father founded the company? My grandfather. Oh, your grandfather founded the company. So his father founded the company already in the early 30th, in the east part of Germany. But after World War II, the company moved to the west part of Germany because it was Russian-controlled area, and company was confiscated several times. And my father joined the company really early in 1950. So it's still family business. Yeah. Then you're the third generation CEO. I'm third generation here. Great, let's go and see what you make. Okay. So I can see the side of a music stand coming down a chute here. Beautifully smooth, isn't it? Also, what you can see here, it's oily, a little greasy. So this, we have to get off, and this will be done in the powder coating process. 60% of our sales is exported, so we sell to 80 countries worldwide. And 70% of our turnover is Europe. Have you found that the weakness of the euro has been a huge advantage for your exports? I would say, yeah, yeah, definitely. A weak euro helps us and as well as all other German companies who are exporting a lot. The weakness of the euro has helped keep Koenigmeyer affordable. Gabriela says, however, that they're not fundamentally trying to be cheaper than their competitors. Of course, we also have to pay attention that our product doesn't get too expensive in the market, but our customers accept that the product can be 15, 20% more expensive than a competitive cheaper made item. Our market is narrow, but what we do, we really want to do it right and just be better than the others. And business is going well for Kernigh and Meyer. It has a turnover of 38 million euros and has grown from a company of just six employees after the war to 280 today, working across three factories. Though Gabriella Kernick admits there is one possible drawback to the family business's success. It's really funny. We are involved in the music industry and don't play an instrument. That's a pity. I always wanted to start, you know, maybe with piano. But so far, I didn't find the time. While the majority of Middlestan firms, like Kernig and Meyer, have remained medium-sized, some are now vast enterprises, with operations all over the world, but often holding on to their middle stand ethos. I'm standing looking at literally hundreds of pallets, stacked on huge ladders. This warehouse is 45 metres high. It's absolutely vast. It's almost like a skyscraper inside with huge metal ladders, and I can see one whizzing towards me now. This huge logistics centre is the heart of Verte Industry Service. You can't miss it as you approach another historic town, Bard-Merkentime. From afar, it looks like a shiny metal box perched on the hillside. This company is the world market leader in selling and delivering fasteners and fixers. Those tiny components, nuts, bolts, clips and electrical parts, which are needed to build products in factories everywhere. Small things to make the world go round. Raina Burkett is executive vice president of Virt Group, the parent company, and is responsible for the industry business which I'm visiting. Down to earth and quietly spoken, he has a welcoming smile and certainly doesn't mind that many people will never have heard of his company, despite it being a world leader. What we do is not in the main focus normally of the press or of our customers, but without us, it would be very hard for them. We're doing the things behind the scene, making the world go around without telling this everybody. We're satisfied by seeing success on the bank accounts. What do you compete on? Is it price or is it quality? Price is never a discussion because we are the most expensive in the market. What we compete with is being always in time, being always with the right quantity, being always very exact, and we think we'll do a little better than the others. A little better than the others? Surely Rainer Burkett is being modest. Last year, the whole of the Vert Group had sales of 11 billion euros, with annual growth of around 8%. He believes much of the Middle Stann's success comes from the quality of the German workforce. It's the education. We have a very well-educated people, a very good education system, and the people at the end of the day are sticking to the company so they can develop long-term ideas, and this gives a special mixture for the success. Of course, the Midlstam does have its problems. Professor of Management, Winfred Weber, says succession can be an issue for these family-run businesses, and they also complain of skill shortages, in spite of a strong apprenticeship system. While there certainly is innovation within the middle stand, they're not Silicon Valley. Even so, Winfred Weber says the long-term outlook, independence and stability of the middle stand are enduring factors which bigger businesses could also benefit from. Winfred Weber says the long-term outlook, independence and stability of the middle stand, are enduring factors which bigger businesses could also benefit from. The middle stand is the future. It's the solution for every business. Even the big companies are trying to learn from the middle stand management system. Because I think the future big company will be a little bit like many Midlstrand companies with a more down-to-earge approach, with flatter hierarchies, more responsibility and more flexibility for the workforce. The history of Germany's success isn't just about making things. There were a lot of inventions which came first and some that you'll have heard of. I went to Mannheim to find out more and started in the courtyard of the city's which came first and some that you'll have heard of. I went to Mannheim to find out more and started in the courtyard of the city's imposing Baroque Palace. On a June morning, 200 years ago, Carl Dreis, an inventor from Mannheim in Germany, set off on his maiden voyage of the bike he'd invented. I'm just going round around the courtyard, which was the beginning of his journey. Whoops! And I am currently riding a wooden replica of that very first bicycle. It's not really that comfortable because the first bike didn't have any pedals, so I'm having to propel myself along. Which is exactly what Karl Dreis did. He claimed he managed to get up to a speed of about 15 kilometres an hour, which is quite something really. Getting a little bit of a rhythm going now. Oh yes, we're picking up speed. Whoops. And Mannheim didn't only invent the first bike. The very first car was also invented in this same city by Carl Benz, he of Mercedes-Benz. And Mannheim came up with other groundbreaking inventions in tractors and rocket planes. So after my workout on the bike, I went round the corner to meet one of the country's top economists, Professor Achim Vambach. He advises the German government and is director of the Centre for European Economic Research, known as the ZEW. We always had many inventors in Germany. But actually in the beginning, made in Germany was invented by the British, a sign of bad quality. Then it turned out to be a sign of good quality. And nowadays, made in Germany is a very helpful trademark. Following the Second World War, Germany rebuilt its cities and factories with the help of international aid and a lot of grit and determination. By the 1950s and 1960s, West Germany was once again Europe's leading industrial economy. With few natural resources, the country has long relied on its inventors and its industry, big and small. But Achim Wambach says that doesn't on its own explain the country's recent success. We have a very strong manufacturing sector, but we have to be aware that was also around 15 years ago. We were a weak economy in Europe, the sick men of Europe. At that time we had 5 million unemployed. And it was the same structure in the economy, so it can't be the only explanation. We can't be the conditions for the work markets to better. We must also, Gerhard Schroeder, the then-chanceller, launching an ambitious program of labor and welfare reform, the work markets to better. We must also over the system of the then-Chryrds, launching an ambitious program of labor and welfare reforms in March 2003. Back in the early 2000s, Germany's economy was in trouble. And Gerhard Schroeder's reform program, known as Agenda 2010, was credited with making businesses more competitive and helping turn the economy around. What happened there was that we had these labour market reforms, so we had a more flexible labour market, so that kept the wages low. So we have relatively low wages. And as we heard earlier from Gabriella Koenig of the Music Stand Company, a weak euro is a great benefit to German exporters. If we were to go back from the euro to the Deutsche Mark, then our products would be 20% more expensive. Huge amount, isn't it? I agree. So it's a huge amount and also explains part of why we are so export-dominated at the moment. We are relatively cheap. So despite the fact that German products can be the most expensive in their sector, a weak euro and wage restraint have in recent years kept them competitive on world markets. But some feel this export-driven success has come at a price to them. The deals we have with other countries are unbelievably bad. Everything's a deficit. I actually said to my people, find a country where we actually do well. Clearly, President Trump's people didn't add Germany to the list. Very bad is how he recently described his country's trade situation with Germany, complaining that it's selling too many cars in the United States. And he's not alone. Germany is criticised for exporting too much and importing too little, giving it a whopping current account surplus, which is a broad measure of the balance of trade of almost $300 billion last year, the largest in the world. And Germany's surplus is currently over 8% of GDP. That's a huge number. So if you see the European Commission, when do they start to worry? And they start to worry if you're beyond 6%. So they worry. And so the question should be worried as well. There are good reasons for the German trade surplus. We have an aging society, so we save a lot. And we just had an economic crisis. You know, as long as we have all these worries, people will say. Do you think Germany will work on the trade surplus? Because you're in the stronger position, and some people say, well, you know, it's because we're successful. It's because we're exporting. We don't really need to worry about it. Sometimes you get the feeling that German officials argue that way, why should we worry? But if you go to the ministry of the last five years, we always debated, you know, what to do about the trade surplus. But there is no easy answer. But there are calls, particularly from outside Germany, for the country to increase spending on domestic infrastructure. Why doesn't Germany invest more at home? Yeah. One is the state could invest more, yeah. And if you see the program for what the parties are proposing for the next election, they all talk about more investment, more public investment, which I think is the right way. The other question is why do the films not invest more, the companies? That's more important because that's about ten times the size of the public investment. German companies do invest, but it's often abroad. Professor Vanbach says skill shortages and high energy prices at home mean it often makes more business sense to open a factory in a cheaper overseas market. But he would like to see them focusing more on Germany, crucially in the digital future. I'm somewhat worried about complacency. The economy is booming, yeah. But for example, with the digital economy, it's not clear that we are doing enough to keep out with the international pace. So we don't have a Silicon Valley in Europe. Yeah, so we really have to catch up. Well, in some cases, the catching up has already begun. We are ready for that future. That definitely is another revolution coming up, a peaceful and literally a quiet one. The CEO of Daimler, maker of Mercedes-Benz cars, there in a landmark presentation at the Paris Motor Show last year. He was announcing that the company that invented the automobile 130 years ago and today's number one seller of luxury cars, that same company says it's about to reinvent itself. It's definitely the biggest revolution the car industry has ever seen. Wilco Stark is head of corporate strategy at Daimler. He's youngish, wears an open-neck shirt and is fairly intense. He lives and breathes the future, a future where car ownership could look very different. We are extremely successful, but we have to be prepared for the future. And if you look what's going on, especially in the US, there's a lot of people actually don't own a car and say, OK, I don't need a car because I use Uber. And therefore it's very, very important to enter this business. And this means... We want to be a mobility provider. Not just a carmaker, but a mobility provider. This is the new buzzword in the car and tech industries, and it involves not just building cars, but providing all sorts of new digital services around transportation. And cars in the future, as many governments are stipulating, will be electric. Daimler has already started on this. We will have a full line-up, 10 electric vehicles until 2022. And then further into the future, those who still want to own a car won't need to drive them. They'll be autonomous or driverless, and much smarter than today, as Daimler outlined at the Paris Motor Show. You head to the airport. Your car automatically reserves its parking spot and checks you into your flight. While you're away, it's free to be used by others, earning some extra money. Before you return, your car will get ready. It charges its batteries, picks up your laundry from the dry cleaners, and has your mail and groceries. A driverless world still pretty hard for most of us to imagine. And for those who won't own a car, and Wilco Stark thinks there could be many, the company is planning fleets of driverless cars, which they will operate and make available for car sharing and ride hailing using taxi apps. They already own some in Europe, but there's further to go. And earlier this year, Daimler announced an agreement with Uber. We cannot cover the whole world. And therefore, we also have to discuss about partnerships, or how we call it sometimes for enemies. So it's friends and enemies, you know. And therefore, we made this deal last year with Uber, saying, once we have our cars ready, we can put it and we can also operate for you, the fleet, but it's based on your network and on your app. But aren't you playing catch-up at the moment with Silicon Valley, with the likes of Google? It was the Google car that everyone had heard of, wasn't it, for several years, before companies like Daimler got into developing their own driverless cars? We have been actually developing driverless cars now for many, many years. There's one big, big difference between Google and Daimler and also what Uber is doing. We can come up with a complete robot car because the sensor set itself needs to be fully integrated into the vehicle and this can only be done by a car manufacturer. So Daimler is looking to a digital future, as are its competitors. This comes at a time when car companies, including Daimler, are under investigation following the Volkswagen diesel emission scandal. But this digital future also needs startups. Launching a business from scratch in Germany, however, is harder than in many places. The World Bank rated it 114th for this. Let's go back to Mannheim, the city where the bike was invented, and where the story of innovation and mobility continues. Well, sort of. I've come to a high-tech shoe company in the city. It's a small startup run by Jacqueline Yilderim, who wanted to find a way of making high-heeled shoes comfortable after hours of wear. I love shoes, but I hate the pain. And so she gave up a well-paid job to develop a product called Comdurin, which is cushioning technology for the pain. And so she gave up a well-paid job to develop a product called Comdurin, which is cushioning technology for the soles of high-heeled shoes. Her company has been around for two years now, and she's already developing new products, including an app to measure your feet for online shoe shopping. Jacqueline did receive help from a government fund and a local accelerator, Startup Mannheim, but she says it hasn't been an easy ride. In Germany, banks are not willing to give a lot of money to startups. This is what I experienced. It was more the risk which was lying in the business model because it was not existing. But from my perspective, banks should more go for exactly those risky, not-known business models and maybe also then in Germany there will be something like an Uber or Apple. The surprisingly low-ranking for ease of starting a business in Germany largely comes down to the amount of bureaucracy required, which Jacqueline also experienced. But the biggest obstacle she believes is the mindset. Society does not consider entrepreneurs as heroes, as I would consider them. For example, in the US, I know the Silicon Valley, the people see you as a rock star because you are an entrepreneur. But here in Germany, it's like, oh, it's too risky. I said, no, no, I'm sure. It is possible. Would you move to the United States? I would love to, yes. Because you think it would be easier there? I'm sure. Well, she wouldn't be the first. I'm an active retirement as successful entrepreneurs sometimes tend to be. Konstantin Gerica can afford to retire early. He's the co-founder of LinkedIn, one of the most successful networking sites. Born and raised in Germany, he moved to Silicon Valley as a student and stayed. Now he mentors young entrepreneurs from around the world, including Germany. I have seen the sons and daughters of sort of the Middle Stand companies. Their parents don't really understand it, but the kids are both excited but also worried about things like LinkedIn and Facebook and Google and connecting things to the cloud and they're trying to figure out how to do that. Constantine Gerrika founded LinkedIn with four others in Silicon Valley, but could he have done it in Germany? Yes, he says, to some extent. In fact, LinkedIn does have a German competitor, Zing, still in business today, but which didn't grow to the same size. There's some ways an advantage to start a company in Germany because the availability of the engineers is much easier. I think the challenges come from the mindset. And German customers are not always the early adopters of new things. They are often more hesitant, and that's holding often Germany back. The second is, where do you look for capital? And the German investors, they are sort of wanting to play it safe than the kind of venture investors that I'm familiar with in Silicon Valley. Their goal is to have the next school goal. So what is the real strength of Germany's economy? The middle stand forms the backbone of its industry, along with giants like Daimler, and the real driver is exports, finding niche markets in which to become world market leaders. Wage restraint, the weakness of the euro, a skilled workforce and labour market reforms are all credited with keeping Germany competitive. But there are challenges. Germany's trade surplus, while a sign of its success, is a problem for other countries. And although German firms are innovative, it's often incremental rather than revolutionary. Even so, that does seem to be changing, and Silicon Valley entrepreneur Constantine Gerrika has no doubt his country will get there in the end. They are slow at the beginning, but then they're actually fairly efficient once they get over that hurdle of adopting something new, then Germany ends up being faster. So by the time the race is finished, Germany is actually there ahead of others. The World of Business was presented by me, Caroline Bailey. The producer was Estelle Doyle. In next week's program, Matthew Guaitha asks whether prisons can be run for profit. Yoga is more than just exercise. It's the spiritual practice that millions swear by. And in 2017, Miranda, a university tutor from London, joins a yoga school that promises profound transformation. It felt a really safe and welcoming space. After the yoga classes, I felt amazing. But soon, that calm, welcoming atmosphere leads to something far darker, a journey that leads to allegations of grooming, trafficking and exploitation across international borders. I don't have my passport. I don't have my phone, I don't have my bank cards, I have nothing. The passport being taken, the being in a house and not feeling like they can leave. World of Secrets is where untold stories are unveiled and hidden realities are exposed. In this new series, we're confronting the dark side of the wellness industry, where the hope of a spiritual breakthrough gives way to disturbing accusations. You just get sucked in so gradually, and it's done so skillfully that you don't realize. And it's like this, the secret that's there. I wanted to believe that, you know, that whatever they were doing, even if it seemed gross to me, was for some spiritual reason that I couldn't yet understand. Revealing the hidden secrets of a global yoga network. I feel that I have no other choice. The only thing I can do I have no other choice. The only thing I can do is to speak about this and to put my reputation and everything else on the line. I want truth and justice. And for other people to not be hurt, for things to be different in the future. To bring it into the light and almost alchemise some of that evil stuff that went on and take back the power.
