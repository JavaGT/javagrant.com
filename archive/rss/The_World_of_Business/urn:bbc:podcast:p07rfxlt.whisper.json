This podcast is supported by advertising outside the UK. I didn't quite know what to expect visiting the Chernobyl zone for the world of business on the BBC. I went exploring the Belarusian side where most of the radiation fell in 1986 when the nuclear reactor exploded across the border in Ukraine. It's a really vast area, tightly controlled and protected, but there are many people living in nearby irradiated lands, and they all need to make a living somehow. It's the last day of summer in Boris Savchina in southern Belarus, and villages have gathered for a top family competition. Four families, the Belskis, the Mastabas, the Bezrujkis and the Nazarenskis and the Nazarekos will show off their skills, cooking, chopping wood, harnessing a horse and singing. They're standing shyly on an outdoor stage dressed in embroidered linen, tables of homemade pickles, cured herring and moonshine ready for the judges. It's a picture of rural life. for the judges. It's a picture of rural life. I'm Monica Whitlock and for global business on the BBC World Service. We've come to try to glimpse what lies behind that picture, a generation since the Chernobyl nuclear reactor exploded 60 kilometers south of here. The reactor is in Ukraine, but 70% of the radioactive south of here. The reactor is in Ukraine, but 70% of the radioactive pollution fell here in Belarus, changing the people, their land and their livelihoods forever. You've seen this film, that, that's the last, Chernobyl. I expect you've seen that recent film, Chernobyl. Well, it's all true. That's how it was. Raw and unvarnished truth. Truth, but without the emotional punch, the pain that we experienced. Jan and Nikolaevna, one of the competition judges, grew up nearby. Now she's deputy chair in the local government executive committee. I remember it well. I was 15 years old. We were evacuated, all us children and pregnant women. After that came an uncertain time when people didn't know whether they should leave or stay. There's been a lot of scientific research since then. It might be possible to live in this place or that place, some trial and error, and it was around 2006 when farms and farm communities began to be built again. In those days, we didn't understand what was going on. But now we have a different way of thinking. We are not just these pitiful Chernobyl people. It's hard to imagine the devastation of Belarus after the explosion. In economic terms alone, the United Nations estimates a loss of $235 billion US dollars. But who can count the lost opportunities or directions in what was then an unborn state? You can feel something of that absence here. I'm walking through vast, flat plains. And beneath our feet are the timbers of abandoned villages buried deep beneath the earth. Big, busy villages once, just like Boris Savchina. Back in 1986 year, 45,000. There was over 20,000 people. Back in 1986, there were 45,000 people living here. More than 20,000 were resettled. Just imagine, everything abandoned, the houses, businesses, school, cultural sites. All these small, decaying buildings. It's all being demolished and the land prepared for other uses, like forestry. The most toxic land, thousands of hectares, is still sealed off in what's called the Radio Ecological Reserve. People call it the zone. But the land here on the periphery is being reclaimed for agriculture. It's turned and treated with mineral fertilizers. The main crop is corn, which resists radio nuclei and rapese, a new crop for Belarus. With corn as fodder and special feed additives, animal farming is also possible. The Budakoff dairy farm rises like a ship above the sea of corn. How many dairy farms are there? Maybe 10. Yes, we've built 10 farms in recent times from 2006 when industrial revival began. There are dairy farms like this, where we are walking now. So I'm just walking down the road of cows. Where we are walking now. So I'm just walking down the row of cows. Black and white, short horn cows. Young graduates in agricultural technology are offered golden handshakes, almost free new build apartments and generous resettlement packages. Of course, automatic systems make everything faster, than milking I mean, and that's where the profit comes from. With hand milking, you can't really manage more than two or 300 cows on a farm. But here we have 500, all thanks to technology. Can we estimate how many people are employed in those new farms? I need to think. Well, on this farm, for example, there are 21 people working. Of course, it's many times less than before. After modernization, there isn't much need for manual labor. When it's all automated, you only need 21. But other farms are different, and maybe employ more people. I can't tell you exactly. Only two women are handling the milking this afternoon, sticking clusters of suction pumps onto the cow's udders, is very different from the milking parlors their mothers would have known. Every drop of every liter of every bottle of every bottle of every bottle, parlours their mothers would have known. Every drop of every litre of every batch of milk is tested for radioactive isotopes, as it arrives at the regional dairy Milcavita for processing and distribution. Milk has shown very high radioactivity in the past, especially cesium-137 and strontium-90. Two of the many radionuclides spewed out by the reactor. Every school child here knows their way around this part of the periodic table, cesium, strontium, plutonium. If you're wondering what's become of the thousands of people who haven't found a place in the new automated regulated world, this might be a good place to start. It's the Sunday market in Hoyniki, the small town that gives its name to the region. Here you can buy or sell anything from motorbike parts to jam. Huge watermelons I can see on my left. Baskets full of red peppers. That's Svetta, hands flying through the cucumbers and tomatoes. That's Svetta, hands flying through the cucumbers and tomatoes. Everyone's buzzing around her. I speak little English. We've bought in Astrachan, Krasnodar, Kazakhstan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan. Sveta buys fruit in all these warmer, faraway places to keep her small stall the best in the market. It's an almighty palaver I can tell you, she says. We're not, Belarus. It's because there aren't many jobs here, well, no jobs really. And if you don't work, you don't eat, as the saying goes. Why don't you move away from here? And the kids, and where too, and what about a house and a school? This is my land and my roots. I don't want to leave, she says. And if they move me into a clean zone, it would just about finish me off. And everyone crowds around agreeing with her. People who did move away, they died, they say. Well, most of them. This radiation is getting better. And it's our radiation. It's what we know and we're used to it. Radioactivity is measured in becherels per kilo. An acceptable level of becquerels is called a norm. Every single commodity has a different norm. An algorithm each trader needs to know. My raspberries have been clean of radiation for the past two years pretty much, says another trader. My apples and cucumbers the same. And if I do get the odd bad batch of raspberries, I don't sell them. I just make them into wine. Sorry, it's not ready yet. V no, no, no, it's not yet. Bela Russian norms are the strictest in the world. No, but it's notherstoy. Bela Russian norms are the strictest in the world. If you compare Belar Russian norms with the norms of European Union, it's a huge difference. So they're very strict. Yes. But even with the strictest norms, anyway, some radionuclids you'll get in the body with the food. Right. Little by little, but every day. Alexei Nesterenko is the director of Belarus' only independent institute for radiation safety, Belrard. Belrad offers practical on-the-ground help to people to manage their businesses and their lives as safety as they can, even in the most remote villages. We have a mobile laboratory which can come direct to the contaminated territories. Take samples of food for measurement. Second second we have a small network of public laboratories mainly they are situated in schools with wide participation of children so they are taking samples making measurements it's half science and half education they are educating their parents. Like, for example, they go to the forest and pick up mushrooms. Then they measure them and draw and sketch of the map, let's say, and point out places where mushrooms are clean, or cleaner, where they are more contaminated. So when you do your on-the-ground monitoring, that's an enormous task. What patterns are you seeing, if any? The contamination itself, of course it's reducing with the years. But when we speak about this, we forget that Sassium 137 appeared on our planet, let's say, after first explosions of nuclear weapons. It was never in ecosystems before. What we know, it's toxic. And that's a consideration for anyone doing business in this region from farming to forestry. There is always a big, very big discussion. What is safe? What dose is safe? What contamination is safe? What is good or what is bad? It's like to work with poison. Would you like a teaspoon or bigger spoon of poison? If you have one teaspoon, you will be okay. Who knows? So this is a folder of original types written letters and notes on the yellowing paper. Alexei keeps a very special drawer of documents at Belrad, type written by his late father Vasili, Belarus's foremost physicist at the time of the catastrophe. KGB agents twice tried to assassinate Vasili, says Alexei. They cut the brake cables of his car and tried to run him over, all to stop these papers reaching the outside world. It's dated here 29th of the 4th, 86. So the chairman of the Prime Minister, let's say, of Belarus about the radiation situation. He writes about contamination in villages which were not evacuated, that contamination there is very high. So these are his measurements and his recommendations? Yes, measurements in MAPS. But everything was secret, secret, secret, secret. And did they answer him? No. This is the Ministry of Public Health of Belarus. This is a list of the places. Detailed. And contamination of the soil. So he made copies because he knew this was dangerous stuff. Yeah. Where did he keep the copies? His predatory man, his friend in the village. The dad's wheeled the axe, the parents saw up the logs together and the children collect the firewood. First prize, an electric mincer. This region is trying vigorously to encourage young families like the Belskis, the Mastabars, the Bezvrujkis, the Nazarekis, the Nazarens. Government perks like free school meals, school buses and kindergartens are all geared towards the young. The competition too is a government scheme to build confidence in village life, a tremendous effort to show that everything is normal. But for anyone over 30 there's a normal before 86 and a normal after. I remember that night of course. I remember that night, of course. It was dark. We loaded our staff onto a truck and left. We all slept together on the floor, covered with blankets. All us, eight children and my mother. We stayed with our relatives, but we came back. We are hardworking people. We have our cattle, our pigs, our ducks. We have a goat and some chickens. We have a kitchen garden. We're self-sufficient. I suppose we could have left forever. But there wasn't much chance of that. Well, there was a chance, but we'd need some money to give us a leg up. We're leaving the...theirce to be......theirce......we're leaving behind the inhabited villages now and heading towards the zone. The proper name is the Radio Ecological Reserve. 2,000 square kilometres of contaminated land close to the border with Ukraine. It's closed by wire fences and strictly guarded. People are not allowed through without special permits. No one can live here and nothing can be built or dug up. As soon as you're inside, thick oak and pine forests take over. But even inside the zone, you can see experimental economic projects. I wasn't expecting this one at all. A herd of beautiful bay horses, black manes and tails flying. The idea is to make money to help fund the reserve itself for the scientists, foresters and fire watchers and to test out what sorts of agriculture might do well on compromised land where humans can never live again. Nikolai Nikolayevich sells his horses for breeding all over Belarus. 16 horses. 16 horses. We built up our farm from just 16 horses. And now we have a herd of 262. And now we have a herd of 262. They are Russian heavy draft horses. So this is a really big stable with dark green paint on the doors and fencing. Was it always here? It was here before the catastrophe. On this place was a colhaz-no-towarne farm. Kolhosh-Octchab. Yeah, this place was a collective farm for dairy products. The October collective farm, it was a really good, strong farm. It even had 25,000 pigs over there in the woods. Then they reconstructed the farm and adapted it for horses. Take a look, we have some mares here and some stallions. Stade there should be one gerbets. If two gerops, our Stalin has to live on his own. If you put two Stalinies in a herd, then there will be trouble. And do you have to test their health because they live here in the zone? Well, we have a vet and he checks them. We haven't recorded anything odd. No morphological changes. Because it's a short life, all of the conga, how do you, 30 years. Because the horse has a short life, 30 years. And already one generation has passed. This is not the first. So we haven't seen any changes and the government provides us with mineral fertilizers phosphorus potassium everything is given to us for free. We lime the soil. All this leads to a decrease in the intake of strontium and cesium in the feed. So our products are clean. We make a thousand dollars a horse. They're not too expensive to buy. One horse about a thousand dollars. They're not very of us. As well as the horse farm, the zone is developing forestry and a pear orchard. Sergei is the chief beekeeper in the contamination zone. It all started to do it as a scientific experiment. It all started as a scientific experiment. We took one or two families of bees to different patches all over the zone, and we found that this place had the least pollution. Come on see. This room was full of comb, dripping with honey. Bees flying about. full of comb, dripping with honey. Bees flying about. And churns to put the honey in. Big Russian stove. And then it's already from the production. How they make the honey, how they shape the cells of wax, how much propolis they make. The laboratory checked all of this. A lot of research was done. We planted flowers here in this field nearby in a small circle to keep the bees near us. Now there's a mix of flowers and herbs go. Now there's a mix way to be, there are acacia, and lipa, and marina. Now there's a mix of flowers and herbs growing. Plenty of dandelions, acacia, lime flowers, raspberries. We planted buckwheat and white clover. The norm is 3,700 becquerels per kilo of honey, and we had only 48 becquerels in spring and 56 in autumn. And this room has spoons and trays of honey in comb that is put through these filters, and you can see it dripping out into the trays. Dark golden honey. The whole batch has to be checked first by the lab. Only after that can we send it out for sale. And you could even export? Belarus doesn't export honey as far as I know. We'd like to try that and we're expanding. Our meat is in Germany, our milk knows and in Belgium, and France, and China, and Japan. Our honey is already known in Germany, in Belgium, France, China. Only yesterday we had some guests from Japan here. In Boris Sovchner, the top prize has gone to the Belski family. The kids are peeling off their national dress and are back in shorts and t-shirts, switching on their phones. This is 2019 after all. What happened here just one generation ago shapes everyone's life in ways impossible to predict. If we speak about Belarus, there are expectations and reality. It will be very nice to evacuate the third part of Belarus population right after Chernobyl and not to come back to this lands for a few hundred years. It is not possible. 30 years is a half-time life. 30 years is a half-time life of caesium 137 which means that half of cesium disappeared but the second half will disappear not in 30 years but in 270 years but in 270 years. So that's why it's a very dangerous situation in general, I mean any nuclear accident. It can doesn't recognize any border, any political system, difference, and it can influence on everyone. For people to understand what can happen, what happened, and what can happen in any country of the world which has a nuclear power plant.
