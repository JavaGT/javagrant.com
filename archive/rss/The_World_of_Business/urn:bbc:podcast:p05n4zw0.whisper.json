This is the BBC's World of Business. I'm Claire Boulderson and the producer is Rosamund Jones. In this week's download edition of Global Business from BBC World Service, we're looking at the ties that bind many employees to their jobs in the US. This is Global Business on the BBC World Service. I'm Claire Boulderson in Boston, Massachusetts, watching the ferries come and go across the harbour in this vibrant city. It's home to some of the world's greatest universities and a diverse economy. But I'm just thinking about all the workers I've met here over the past few days who say they've felt their career options have been limited or their wages have suffered or even that they've been trapped in their jobs. And the reason they feel like that might surprise you. It's because of a specific clause in their employment contracts. Bosses in Massachusetts, as in the majority of US states, can require workers to sign a non-compete agreement when they take up a new job. Russell Beck, a Boston-based lawyer and expert in these clauses, showed me a typical contract. So in this particular agreement, which is fairly representative, it restricts the employee from directly or indirectly engaging in activities that compete with the company's business. Not just working for a competitor, but working for themselves as a competitor as well. That's exactly right. So once an employee has signed, their options for escape from that job are limited. They can't work for another employer or start up on their own in the same type of business without the risk of being sued. They shall not accept employment with, advise, provide consulting services, or acquire any interest in a business that competes with the employer. And that is to tie them for how long. Does the contract also stipulate that? Yes. Typically we see one year, which is what's in this agreement. Some others are restricted for two years. This isn't like garden leave used in some countries where an employee sits out their notice period at home on full pay. That's rare in the US. Usually, if you've signed a non-compete and you leave your job, you have to find work that's very different to what you've been doing or live off your savings for a year or move. But even that doesn't always help. This particular one is worldwide. Worldwide? Because the company operates worldwide, exactly. Other companies that have more restricted geographic reaches tend to have more narrow restrictions, a particular state or a particular region. How widespread are contracts like this, non-compete contracts, in use in employment in this country? They're very widespread. The studies show that about 40% I think of people have signed one at one point in their career. So they're used in more industries now than in the past, and they're used deeper in the industries than they have been in the past. Deeper meaning? Meaning the levels of employees who are restricted by them. So while historically, typically you would see these used primarily for executives and that level of employee, now you see them for all levels. And Russell Beck says employers are increasingly taking their workers to court in an effort to enforce non-compete agreements. In this program, I'll be asking what the broader economic impact of these restrictive covenants, as they're sometimes known, might be. Do they stifle new businesses or strengthen established ones? And I'll also meet workers who say their careers and their finances have been badly affected by non-competes. My name is Brian Connolly and every company I've worked for I've had to sign non-competes. Really right from the beginning? Very beginning. back in 1984. Brian's working life has been spent in high-tech businesses, an area in which these clauses are common. But Brian didn't have any problems moving between jobs until after the global financial crash. I had been working for a startup. It was in the field of medical diagnostics, the family money and the grant money that we're supposed to get that year dried up in the recession. There were 14 people total. 11 were laid off. I got a call as this was happening from a former colleague who said, oh, by the way, are you interested in working for another medical diagnostic company? I went to an employment lawyer, found out from her that it wouldn't be a good idea to do that. Because of your non-compete? Because of the non-compete specifically, yes. You were one of the people who was laid off because this company was going through difficulties. It wasn't your choice. You still can't take another job in the same area? That's what I was advised, yes, at the time, right. Were you surprised at that? I was very surprised at that, very disappointed. So after that, I ended up working for a friend doing a lot of consulting jobs here and there. You're working in an area that isn't really your specialist area. You were not making anything like the money you'd made when you were employed? No, and that's a big impact of what happened to me. I did some calculations yesterday, and I'm about $300,000 short of where I should be. And it's not just a question of the non-competes keeping the unemployment, but because you have to be selective, and it takes, on average, six months to get involved in a retirement plan at new companies, and I'll be working until on the Thuselah, basically. You're very familiar with non-competes. You've had to sign them in every job. Has there been a point at which you've ever said, you know what, guys, I'm not signing this. No, I want to work for you, but I'm not signing this. I like to get paid. So you would never have challenged it in the past just because you had to have the job? Right. What do you think would have happened if you'd said, oh, by the way, I'm not signing this? I think they would to have the job. Right. What do you think would have happened if you'd said, oh, by the way, I'm not signing this? I think they would have withdrawn the offer. Brian Connolly is by no means a lone voice. Many of the people I spoke to felt they had no choice but to sign a non-compete agreement and later bitterly regretted it. Dan Foley, for example, who's had a long career in recruitment, another area where non-competes are pretty routine. I signed my non-compete when I was 22 years old fresh out of college and it can be gut wretching quite honestly. How am I going to deal with this thing? It can grade on you. And it's not just the personal cost. Dan believes non-competes can be counterproductive in other ways. If you have people who want to leave your business, it's not doing you any favors to keep them in the business by virtue of a non-compete. You've heard the expression, quit and stay? People who have said, I want to leave, but they're not really committed to the organization they work for. Have you come across people like that? Absolutely. I've seen that a bunch of times. Absolutely. I also met Eric Wessel. He's in his late 20s and signed a non-compete agreement when he started work with a multinational sportswear company. He was thrilled to land a good job straight out of college. You'd think it's great, and it was great for a period of time, but then I just realized it wasn't for me in the long run. As it became clear to me that I would more than likely be leaving, that's when I immediately thought of, like, you know, what options don't I have? You kind of have to think about it in reverse, like not what you'd like to be doing, but what can't you do? In Boston, though there were many companies that were similar to my own, like athletic apparel, I couldn't necessarily jump to one of those without there may be being an issue. So I was like, ah, you know, I felt restricted for sure, if that makes sense. Yeah, because if you had just risked it, there was the possibility you'd end up in court. Was that in your back of your mind? Yeah, I mean, they could roll over me if they wanted to, I'm sure, like with the money they had behind them. You just never know. The big what if. The big what if. Judges do often favour employees in court cases if they think the non-competes unreasonable in scope or has been imposed without consultation. But it's a big risk, because even if the worker wins, they're still likely to be saddled with enormous legal bills. Much of the effect of the non-competes is this chilling effect. Many employees will say, oh, I signed this, I better live up to it. I'm scared of being sued. They signed it and they think I have to stay put. Matt Marks is an associate professor at Boston University's Questrum School of Business. You're probably going to have your employees sign some sort of employment agreement. So if you add a paragraph or a page saying, if you leave here, you can't go to a rival, that costs nothing. And you may not have to spend a dime on legal expenses. You may never have to sue anyone. Just having signed the agreement, they may stay. And so it's very economical that way. Matt Marks' research suggests non-competes limit worker mobility. Other studies have found they can also keep wages down because workers lose their bargaining power. Both those concerns are cited in a recent US federal government report, which concluded that while the agreements can sometimes be useful, they can also be used in ways that favour the interests of the firm over the worker. That worries Professor Marx too. He used to work in the tech sector and signed his first non-compete without having a clue what he was doing. They said, welcome to the company, and here's a bunch of forms for you to sign. So health insurance, 401k, direct deposit, non-compete, and I'm like, non-ca-what? What is that again? And they said, oh, it's standard. Everyone signs it, don't worry about it. And so I signed it. That's true most of the time. So I did a survey back in 2009 where I asked engineers from around the country who had signed a non-compete. I asked them, when did they ask you to sign? Was it in the job offer? Was it up front? Was it later on after you started work? And what I found is that less than a third of the time do the workers know that they're going to have to sign a non-compete if they accept the job? So 70.5% of the time, it's after that. After they've taken this job offer, turned down other job offers, and after they've lost all of their negotiating leverage. I'm on Boston Common in the center of the city and right in front of the Massachusetts State House, a lovely red brick building with white stucco colonnades on the front and a gleaming golden dome. And I've come here because this whole issue of non-compete contracts has been on the political agenda here for a very long time. Massachusetts is just one of a number of U.S. states where there's a growing movement to reform these agreements. One of the people leading the efforts here is State Representative Laurie Early. This has been a journey I've been on for over eight years at this point. We've proposed everything from banning them altogether to just tightening them up around the edges. Tell me what you're proposing now. So the way the bill stands right now is it limits the duration of non-competes to one year. Now, over the course of the years that I've been doing this, I've seen non-competes as long as three years. And three years is obviously unfair and way too long to bind somebody and tell them that they can't work. So a year still seems like a long time as far. A year does. But the upside for employees is the many protections that are in this bill. So there's something we call a notice provision, which requires that employer has to provide the employee in writing the intent to have them sign this agreement, what the agreement is going to be. So just to be clear, that means you can't turn up for your first day of work and be presented with the papers. You will have had to have seen this sometime before you actually start the job. That's exactly right. Sounds like a minor thing, but that's a big deal. It's putting the employee on notice that this is going to be part of your agreement. You better find out what this means. And probably the biggest protection in this bill is who can validly sign a non-compete. My own daughter in an unpaid internship, unpaid, was asked to sign a non-compete. And we see this all the time. Over the years, the testimony that we've heard, we've heard from a camp counselor at a day camp that couldn't babysit during the year. She worked at a summer camp, and then for the rest of the year, she was bound by a non-compete. But we've also seen people working in pizza shops, people making sandwiches. Jimmy Johns is a company here in America that was notorious for binding their workers, people making sandwiches and telling them that they can't work within a certain radius of a Jimmy Johns. Well, Jimmy Johns are everywhere. So it pretty much rendered them unemployable in that field across the entire nation. At this point, you may be thinking as as I was, that reform sounds long overdue. You might also be thinking it's all a bit un-American. What about the freedom of the market and for that matter of the individual? But there's another side to the story, of course, which is why many American companies use non-competes. I've come about an hour and a half west of Boston to the small town of Holyoke. It's on the Connecticut River. And from the second half of the 19th century, for about 100 years, that made it a perfect place for paper production. The riverbank is still lined with old paper mills. At one point, there were hundreds of them. Most are now derelict and boarded up. But there are one or two that are still running and some of them doing increasingly specialized high-tech work. This is one of the mills run by the Hazen Paper Company, founded in 1925. We're most famous for the Super Bowl program cover, which we do every year. John Hazen is the third generation of his family to run the company. In the depths of the post-crash recession, he decided the only way to revive its fortunes was to invest heavily in advanced technology for holographic design and printing. We really reinvented ourselves. We were making, you know, really a mammoth investment, risking everything. We were betting the proverbial farm. You have to keep in mind, in 2009, the world was falling apart. And we were hurting badly, but we had no choice but to go forward. So we continued to hire and we created new jobs during that very bleak time. You know, I think that what we did was to create a future for ourselves. It was at this point that for the first time in its history, Hayes and Paper are some of the new hires to sign non-compete agreements because the company wanted to protect the intellectual property tied up in this big investment. Our top executives who were privy to the plans and the formulas and the contacts we asked to sign non-competes with. If you hadn't been able to use non-competes when you did that big expansion, that major commitment of investment, do you think you would have done it or would you have thought twice about what you were doing there? It definitely is a factor in the decision-making process. It has to be because you're talking about, you know, a lot of capital and people. There's a lot at stake here. It's not just us. It's the lives of our employees, their livelihoods. So, yes, we definitely relied heavily on the non-compete. Only about 5% of Hazen employees have signed non-competes. And unusually, their agreements say they will be paid some of their salary if they have to take a break between jobs. But nowadays, John Hazen doesn't ask new workers to sign. He's taken out patents on some of their salary if they have to take a break between jobs. But nowadays, John Hazen doesn't ask new workers to sign. He's taken out patents on some of his technology and is happy to rely on trade secrets and intellectual property laws to protect the company's specialist knowledge. Some businesses, though, take a tougher approach. Well, I've now come to a very modern new building on the edge of a busy highway, just on the outskirts of Boston. And I've come to see a company here that's only two years old, but it's already got 200 employees. And what they're trying to do here is going to completely, they hope, disrupt the agricultural sector. It's called indigo, and in its laboratories, scientists are harvesting microbes from plants and working out which ones will help create the healthiest crops. The commercial potential of all this technology is huge, which means indigo is fiercely protective of its research. All the 200 employees here, including the receptionist who met me at the door, have signed non-compete agreements. Paul Dacia is Indigo's chief lawyer. We need to maintain our competitive edge, and one of the ways we'll do that, besides having the best products, is to also protect our intellectual property through a covenant not to compete. Why does everyone at Indigo have to sign one of these? Because not everybody is going to have that valuable, innovative knowledge. Everybody is contributing to the success of the company. That means even the administrators, there is trade secret information on confidential information crossing everyone's desks because we are so small and they have exposure to everything that we're doing on the company. But you could use the existing trade protection laws, no, the ones that protect intellectual property? Well, the Achilles heel with trade secret protection is, how do I know? So if you or I walked out the door and across the street, how am I going to know whether or not you've misappropriated those trade secrets? And then when and if I find out, it's too late with a covenant not to compete, find out, it's too late. With a covenant not to compete, as long as it's written in a manner that protects the company's legitimate business interests, I don't have to get to that issue. So, effectively, the non-compete clause is a preemptive strike, but at what cost? It seems the one person who isn't really taken into consideration at all in any of this is the employee and what they want. Is it good for employees? Yes. Always remember that these contracts protect that particular company's intellectual property rights to protect and enhance their competitive advantage. And being able to do that allows that employee to be gainfully employed and to seek employment elsewhere. If the person wants to seek employment at a competitor, that's fine. They'll have to wait. If they haven't made the decision to protect themselves economically, that's not my problem. If Paul Dacia sees non-competes as vital to the prosperity of businesses like Indigo, what does he make of the political efforts to reform the way they're used? If it's a camp counselor or a hairdresser or a summer intern for a month, that would not be something that I would subscribe to. I would find it offensive, but I do not feel it should be changed by statute. But it won't change in any other way? Well, I would suggest that they get a lawyer and walk into court, and I think I know what the judge would say. There's a problem, though, isn't there, with all of this, which is that people can't afford to go to court necessarily, and therefore just having the contracts, knowing they might be used, has this sort of slightly chilling effect, and it makes people hesitant about changing jobs. Well, there are a number of jobs out there. People have a choice. You don't have to go work at the particular company or entity that has proposed the agreement to you. So you're convinced then, from what you're saying, that there doesn't really need to be reform of these contracts? The current law is alive and well. There's no need for that to be changed. Not every new business feels the same way. At the trendy open plan offices of a tech company on the other side of Boston, a mostly young staff listen to music as they work. I'm Jules Pieri. I'm co-founder and CEO of the Gromit. The Gromit is an online marketing business. It finds, tests and then launches new products made by small independent producers. The place is stacked high with boxes here. How many do you normally have being launched at any one time? So we look at 300 ideas a week and we launch only five to eight. Jules founded the company nine years ago. She's now got a staff of 80 and she's never asked any of them to sign a non-compete agreement. That was one of the first decisions I made to not use non-competes. When I thought about what it meant for me as a leader to say to somebody that they more or less had a kind of servitude to the company just didn't make sense to me. I was building a company in the shape I thought it should be. Why would I install something like that right away? And I will say I was shocked when I realized how many sort of hip, happening, popular companies maintain them. And they say, look, yeah, I hate them too, but when everyone else gets rid of them, I will too. And my attorney definitely said, you're crazy. Everybody has a non-compete. What are you doing? To right from the start, knowingly remove a potential protection for the company. We're pretty much out there. You don't worry about that. I treat them like, I know you could be somewhere else. So therefore I'm going to make sure you want to be here. It's simple. Jules Pieri isn't the only Boston-based entrepreneur who's rejected non-competes. Dan Foley, the recruitment expert we heard from earlier, now has his own business and he doesn't use them either. But from personal experience, he also worries about the impact of non-competes on start-ups. When he began his new business, Dan employed some former colleagues. They'd already resigned from their old company, so this wasn't poaching. Still, within weeks, their former bosses sued. It took about four to six months to settle it. What was the agreement? They could work for you, but in areas that were not directly competitive to their old company? Essentially, that's the type of settlement you can get. What was the impact of having to deal with all of this while you're trying to start a company? It was detrimental. We agreed to some things all of this while you're trying to start a company? It was detrimental. We agreed to some things that seemed fairly harmless at the time, but as time progressed, we realized like, this was a little more difficult than we thought. Do you think your business has suffered because of this, that you haven't been able to get people you want and deploy them in the jobs that you want to deploy them in? Yeah, I do. I think that companies suffer because they can't hire some people, and I think individuals suffer because they don't have free movement. I think most entrepreneurs start businesses in industries they know and are familiar with, and they tend to leave larger organizations. So I think the scary part for the entrepreneur is knowing that you could be pursued from the large organization that has more money. It's not a very comforting feeling. There's a buzz to the streets of Boston. On warm autumn days, pavement cafes and restaurants are full. Business is good. Economic growth in Massachusetts is well above the U national average. Unemployment is low. What role non-compete agreements play in the economy here isn't entirely clear. Companies like indigoes say by protecting intellectual property, they strengthen businesses. Others, as we've heard, say that they can kill entrepreneurial zeal. One thing is clear, though, they are not essential to growth. Lots of countries manage without them, as does perhaps America's most economically dynamic state, California, as business professor Matt Marks discovered, to his surprise. Before I got a PhD and became a professor, I spent about a decade working in different high-tech startups. One of those was here in Boston, and the other was out in Silicon Valley. And I was a manager in both of those startups. And in Boston, I could pretty much count on people staying with the company. In Silicon Valley, I remember the first time one of the people on my team decided to quit. And he said, you know, it's been fun, but I'm going to go work for company XYZ. And I said, wait a second. They're like two miles down the road. They're in our same industry. Didn't we have you sign a non-compete? And this is a direct quote. He looked at me and said, dude, you must be new here. This is California. When someone comes to me and says, I have two job offers, one in Boston, one in Silicon Valley, what should I do? And I say, well, all things equal, you should go to California. And I've had students come back to me saying, I wish I'd listened to you. I took a job, and then after two years, I wanted to start a company, and I realized I couldn't because my employer called me up and said, hey, we hear you're doing a startup but you can't because of the non-compete. And so yeah, I advise my students to go to California. Like Massachusetts, several states have looked at reforming non-compete agreements in recent years. Some have ruled that certain professions like-compete agreements in recent years. Some have ruled that certain professions, like doctors, can't be covered by them. Others have reduced the time an employee can be bound by an agreement. For what's being discussed in the State House in Boston, could result in some of the most comprehensive reform so far, if that is, anything is passed. A lot of businesses are happy with the status quo. And eight years after the issue was first raised in the legislature, there's still no guarantee that anything about non-compete agreements will change. That was Global Business on the BBC World Service with me Claire Boulderson. The producer was Rosamond Jones. Yoga is more than just exercise. It's the spiritual practice that millions swear by. And in 2017, Miranda, a university tutor from London, joins a yoga school that promises profound transformation. It felt a really safe and welcoming space. After the yoga classes, I felt amazing. But soon, that calm, welcoming atmosphere leads to something far darker, a journey that leads to allegations of grooming, trafficking and exploitation across international borders. I don't have my passport. I don't have my phone. I don't have my bank cards. I have nothing. The passport being taken, the being in a house and not feeling like they can leave. World of Secrets is where untold stories are unveiled and hidden realities are exposed. In this new series, we're confronting the dark side of the wellness industry, with the hope of a spiritual breakthrough gives way to disturbing accusations. You just get sucked in so gradually and it's done so skillfully that you don't realize. And it's like this, the secret that's there.
