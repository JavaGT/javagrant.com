This podcast is supported by advertising outside the UK. This is the BBC's world of business. I'm Ruth Alexander. And in this week's download edition of In Business from BBC Radio 4, producer John Murphy and I find out how to fail well. This one has received a lot of attention. What is it? What does it look like? Well, a face mask. Yeah. With worryingly an electric cord attached to it. Exactly. It's a Rejuvenik. It's an American beauty mask. So you strap it onto your head and then it gives you electric shocks for about 15 minutes. Oh my goodness. Can you see behind? You can see the electrodes there. You look on this side here. Is that safe? Well, it never got safety approved. And then if you use it for several months, you'll be as beautiful as you recognize her. Linda Evans from Dynasty. Wow, I too could look like her just with a few electric shots every day. It does look like something out of a horror movie. You're listening to Global Business on the BBC World Service. I'm Ruth Alexander. And this is Samuel West, the curator of the Museum of Failure. He's a man with a big grin and a boundless enthusiasm for commercial flops. We've tried it. It does give you a nice little shot. Can you look at me? I do. You've tried it. It does give you a nice little shock. A little thing. Look at me? I do. You are looking good. So why did you pick it? Why is it here? Obviously, it's a failure. But I mean, come on, look at it. Would you buy it? No. No. Okay. End of discussion. There are around 70 products on show at the museum in the southern Swedish town of Helsingborg. Everything from Heinz Green sauce. It's a green ketchup. Didn't catch on. No. To inflatable furniture. IKEA's biggest failure. If you open a window, it lets an area in your apartment, your furniture gets rearranged. Every item on display is an expensive mistake or innovation gone wrong, dug out of obscurity by Samuel West. He's a clinical psychologist specialising in organizational behavior and he's on a mission to get the corporate world to open up about its mistakes. The majority of all innovation projects, they fail. Some estimates say 80 to 90 percent. And these products we never see because companies, they hide them, they sweep them under the carpet. And what I've done with the Museum of Failure is taking some of those and put a spotlight on them and said, hey, let's not be embarrassed about these. Let's learn from these failures. I wanted to know the real story, like when things don't go well, and that's where failure comes in. Anybody who's successful has failed countless times. And I think it's in the failure. That's where the interesting stories are. But we just, we don't get to hear about them. So why don't companies talk about this more then? It's the same way we as individuals hide when we fail. It doesn't feel, it feels uncomfortable, we're ashamed. And there's no real difference between a person and a company. They hide when they fail. They hide when they're vulnerable. Working with companies, Samuel West says he came to believe the biggest barrier to innovation is the fear of failure. It's sort of corporate mumbo-jumbo sometimes where they say, oh yeah, we create a safe environment to fail, but then they penalise people or teens that do fail. The question is how firms and the individuals inside them can overcome that. In this program, we're going to explore failure, what causes it, what it feels like, and how to make the most of it. Oh, that's a good one. So we're looking at a little glass cabinet here, and in the middle of it is a small plastic doll. It looks a bit like a Cindy or a Barbie, dressed in a nice red top and a red shirt skirt, and I like her green shoes. The doll right there is from 1979 it's growing up skipper it was two dolls in one because she was both a girl prepubescent girl and then if you rotated her arm one round she grew breasts and a tighter waist. Wow. Even if it was in late 70s, the public reaction was not merciful towards Mattel. The parents didn't want this. Introducing the greatest taste discovery in a hundred years. Introducing the new taste of Coca-Cola. In the 1980s, another huge company made what feels like an even bigger misstep. Coca-Cola, feeling under pressure from its rival, Pepsi, took drastic action. It changed its recipe. People were outraged. You don't touch the classic Coke recipe. Yeah, what's wrong with Coke? Yeah, and they were forced to relaunch the original Coca-Cola, which they called a Coca-Cola classic. This was Coca-Cola having a crisis of confidence. Absolutely. And not understanding what their brand is about. Yeah. There's several stories in here at the museum where the companies, they think that they own the brand, when in actuality it's the consumers that own the brand and the consumers sometimes understand that brand better than the brand itself absolutely and enjoy the best is the whole area they want to see the bike some museum visitors point out a bicycle standing on display it's notorious in Sweden. Let's go and see it. I like the colour. Yeah, lovely kind of sea green turquoisey colour. What's it called? The itera. In Swedish we say Aetera. It was supposed to completely revolutionise the Swedish bicycle industry by using plastic instead of metal. Oh, right. So it's made entirely of plastic. Even a spokes. Everything is made of plastic. Handled bars. You know, plastic was at the time in 1982, the most exciting material. It's beautifully designed. I think it's a beautiful bike. It is very attractive. Yeah. So it was supposed to be half price because of using plastic instead of metal. It turned out it was twice the price because it was tricky to construct. And the most damning feature was that the plastic frame is not rigid or sturdy enough. So the whole bike wobbles as you bike. So it's a wobbly bike wobbles as you bike. So it's a wobbly bike. A wobbly bike. Okay. We tracked down the bicycle's designer, Klaus Nordenstom. He can laugh at it. Now. Class is an eccentric designer-come inventor who lives by the sea in a small house filled with musical instruments and books the walls decorated by his own fantastical artwork. In the late 1970s, class was working as a graphic designer in TV when a couple of ambitious directors at Volvo asked if he could put his creative mind to designing a plastic bicycle. I spent about two or three years working with the bicycle. So what was your vision for this bike? To conquer the world, naturally. We have very big plans. It couldn't rust. It could be cheaper and easier to produce and fit in every climate. And why hasn't it conquered the world? It's a very difficult question to answer. There are so many answers to that question. One reason could be we were too much in a hurry to get it on the market. It wasn't ready when it came. Our directors in the Iateria company were too eager to be billionaires. So it got to market before you'd absolutely got the product perfect? Yes, yes. It wasn't perfect from the beginning. Meanwhile, an oil crisis pushed up the price of plastic. And to compound its problems, rival bicycle manufacturers launched a smear campaign against the bike. They spread fake news. A lot of fake news. What did they say? They said it didn't work at all. It was impossible to ride. It was untrue. But I have been told it wobbled. No, no. All wrong. Because we made it stiffer and stiffer. But the modifications had to be made in the full glare of publicity. And with costs spiraling and sales barely registering within three years the itera bicycle project was over along with the bike world's appetite for plastic what does that tell you about how people react to failure they laugh at it they're afraid they laugh when i ride a itia, I couldn't use a helmet because they laughed even more that you need protection helmet. This bike is so wobbly and unsafe. You need to wear crash gear. And what impact does that have if people laugh at failure, if they're afraid of failure, does that matter? Yes, it's matter a lot. It's necessarily not to be afraid of failures because it's a base for development and success. Some commercial failures do break new ground. The music you're listening to in this program is from a Roland synthesizer, the TB303. Released in 1981, most people hated the sound and it was quickly withdrawn. But a few started experimenting and a whole new musical genre was born. Acid House. A number of other objects in the Museum of Failure went on to gain cult status after their initial flop. Good morning! Check this baby out! The famous Ford Edsel. No, no, no. From now on it's an Edsel. It's not a Ford. He just told me. He told me. I'm not allowed to say the F word. No, no, no. And glorious picket. From now on, it's an Edsel. It's not a fore. He just told me. I'm not allowed to say the F word. Oh, really? So just Edsel. And you're the owner. I'm Mike. Nice to meet you. What's your name? Graphic designer and car dealer Mike Hunafalk. The Edsel was released in 1957 in a whirl of publicity. Edsel, design for elegance, engineered for action. Ford spent hundreds of millions of dollars designing and marketing a car of the future for America's middle classes to swoon over. Wow, I'm just looking inside. Look at those seats. Black and pink leather to go with the pink outside. And the steering wheel, right with the buttons. These are the buttons. You've got to show them how these buttons work. Sit in. Lovely, thank you. You could change gear at just the touch of a button. Really comfortable. I mean, it feels like a luxury car. Well, it has some cool design features that wasn't appreciated at the time. So for the deal of your lifetime, see your Edsel dealer. The Edsel turned out to be a massive misadventure. People hated the buttons. They were in the center of the steering wheel where you'd expect to find the horn, and they thought the car was ugly and overpriced. A reaction, the Ford executives, hadn't at all foreseen. They got the marketing guys spending 250 millions. That's 10 times more today on advertising and commercials, on TV. Pretty stupid without a market. They should never have built it. There was no market. US went into a recession at the time when this car was launched and everybody was looking at smaller cars, more fuel efficient. So there's nothing wrong with the car. It works. Absolutely. The lesson, know your market, and if you hype something up, your customers will judge it all the more harshly. The Edsel is now a classic business school case study in how not to launch a product, and is a collector's item. 60 years later, this ugly duckling became a swan. Yeah. This is so cool. This is way cool. I never thought this would happen. We're driving in a Ford Edsel, downtown Helsingborg, with a BVZ here air like giving him a ride well you can see on the design at the time that we are going to the moon so what planet you want me to take you wow getting the ingredients right for a new product isn't easy as as any cook knows. So every Thursday I cook lunch here for all the entrepreneurs. Eating is such a strong social activity to do. Susanna Bill is the chef at the ground, a community of start-up companies in the city of Malma. And here is in the kitchen where it all happens. Susanna's an entrepreneur herself, developing new food products, and she acts as a kind of agony ant to the fledgling founders. The kitchen is a very good way of having open-hearted discussions about all sorts of things. Once head of innovation at a large multinational technology company, Susanna's reinvented herself several times. She's got a number of failed ventures behind her. And, like all entrepreneurs, she'll tell you that failure is a necessary step on the path to success. But she says it's a path not everyone can take. You know, there's this saying in Asia that you lose your face, or like in Swedish you would say that you drop your pants. And it's just really embarrassing. You feel terrible. You want to go in hiding. The Swedish mentality is very communal. Like we want to be part of something. We don't want to stick out. Being an entrepreneur is very much about daring to stick out. And if you fail as an entrepreneur, then people can say, she or he stood out from the crowd and see what happened. But I have friends outside here who tried to start companies and it didn't work and now they're back in corporations again. It's like they don't trust themselves anymore. So I think in a way not everybody is really up to managing or dealing with failure because it does take a lot from you as a person to do it because yes you do risk a lot of things. Paradoxically perhaps you have to have failure on your mind if you're going to achieve success. Oh for sure yeah yes. If you never take risks if you're going to achieve success. Oh, for sure, yeah. Yes. If you never take risks, you'll never go to move forward. Back in the Museum of Failure. And what's this in the box at the back? Twitter Peak. Oh, I love the Twitter Veek. It's perfect for the Museum of Failure. Twitter Pete looks a lot like a smartphone, but with almost none of the functionality. All you could do with it was use the social networking app, Twitter. This is 2009. This is at the time when people already had smartphones. So anybody who tweets that much already has the app. Why would they buy a dedicated device? And did they buy it? No, they didn't. It was a huge flop. It's one of my favorites because the idea is just, why did they make it? There was one tech reviewer who wrote, The Twitter Peak is so dumb, it makes my brain hurt. Now, you must understand that Twitter Peak was a more or less publicity stunt intended only to amuse. The man behind Twitter Peak, confident New Yorker Amulsaver, I had to break it to him that his creation was in the museum of failure. He took it on the chin. I mean, it's one of my few museum-worthy creations, so it's very difficult to be too sad about it. Of course, commercially, Twitter Peak was a ridiculous failure. It was a little flare into the sky, and all it did was its mission before it burnt up and disappeared. And its mission was what, to grab attention? Yeah, just to be interesting. Its reception was, shall we be generous? Mixed. No, let's be honest. It was savage. Amal remembers sitting down to watch it being reviewed on one of the U.S.'s biggest TV shows. The editor of one of the big tech magazines brings it out, introduces it to the host, and the whole studio is roaring with laughter. And then all the big retailers who were carrying the Twitter peek or writing me emails the next morning saying, they were laughing at us, weren't they? Not with us. Three years later, Peek pulled the plug on all its services, and the company was sold. Serial and successful entrepreneur, Amal, shrugs it all off. People don't even talk about failure anymore. In Silicon Valley today, the word is not even relevant. No one even cares. I mean, I am involved over the years now in more than 100 startup companies. I might have started 10 of them. I don't even remember three or four of them. Maybe two or three of them were flaming wreckages, and two or three of them have been massively successful. Yeah, Silicon Valley, we don't talk about failure anymore. We talk about search. You're looking for something that works. And as you look for something that works, it's a bit like the laboratory. It's like Fleming with all those petri dishes on the window and then one day something's rolling. It's not that the other petri dishes were failures. They were just efforts. And then this one is penicillin. But what about your customers who've bought a product that becomes defunct as happened when Peek went offline? People do complain if you change anything. Well, isn't that fair enough? They weren't changing something. The service they'd paid for was ending. No, fair enough. And actually, you know, it was really both amusing and very fair criticism made by some of these codgers who were sending us their messages. We called the product when we sold it for the $200 up front. We called it peak for life. And they kept writing to us, you know, dozens of people wrote to me and said, I'm not dead yet. Life of the service, life of the product, not your life, but whatever. Pretty ruthless, a useful quality in business. And one, as we're about to hear, which is vital when something's not working out. Because there's failing and there's failing well. This is the largest R&D centre in the world. So it's the biggest research and development centre for flooring. By far, yeah. So let's go this one. It's hard to keep up. Darko Pervan is the energetic founder of Valinga Innovation, a flooring company based in Vecan, just a little north of Helsingborg. If you want to see innovation success, almost everyone we'd met told us, go and see this company. Flooring, we thought. Really? Okay. Gosh. It is the most automatic flooring production line in Europe today. This is mainly laboratories. It's huge, it's huge. The area we have under roof is roughly 50,000 square meters. Okay, that's big. That's big. Floors, it turns out, can be cutting edge and their maker's dynamic. Defying a limp from childhood polio, Darko Pavan speeds around, always a couple of steps ahead, proudly showing off his innovations new and old. So this is the first laminated floor either produced in March 1977, which I had in my hand, and showed IKEA. This here is the panel you took to IKEA? Yeah, that one. Before he started his own company, Darko was head of the team which invented laminate flooring, took it to market and gave it its name. What should we call it? I said, what is this? This is laminate. Okay, call it laminate floor. Oh, he's off again. This is our locking department, and you can see how the locking system works. Darko set up his own company 25 years ago, moving on from Laminate to develop click technology for floorboards, no need for glue or nails. Like its owner, the company doesn't like to stand still, continually working to perfect the technology. We call this 5G, Y5G, because it's the fifth generation. Docko told us they invest a remarkable 50% of everything they earn into research and development. All innovations are solutions to problems. And then we use the knowledge from our flooring solutions to develop click furniture. Have you put any products on the market that have failed? Never. All our projects generally are global success. So our locking technology has taken about 90% of the world market today. What's the secret to their success? We never start up a project based on just feelings. That is a major mistake that some inventors do. They base their work on feeling. We, on the other hand, base everything on objective, detailed analysis. You have to overcome the fear from problems and so on by objective analysis. If they show that we are right, we go for it and we are all sure that we will be successful. So you have to overcome the fear of failure? Yes. Yes. I'm going to go this way. It smells lovely in here. Wood. Mmm. Wood shavings. Here we're just testing, testing, testing. A company's success, Darko believes, is largely based on its ability to handle failure, though he prefers to use the words experiments and tests. If we have 200 ideas that we analyze, maybe only 10 are reaching the stage of becoming prototypes. 190 I throw in the garbage. 95% of the stuff you test here. But the 95% has to be killed as soon as possible. The earlier you can kill a product that will not fly the cheaper it is. You must have the courage to say we were wrong. This idea that initially looked nice is a dead duck. It will never, never fly. Get rid of it and concentrate to something else. And how do you manage to resist that then? Because it's very human to get attached to an idea, to want to keep it alive, particularly if you spent money on it. I love a discussion where someone says, this is wrong, this is a failure, and I understand it, and I said, yes, you're right, you saved a lot of money for me because we stop it right now. That is the best result I can get from a discussion. And that means that in beginning a lot of projects are put aside, but sooner or later, we will find the golden egg. Then we have to go for it. Is there something special about those who have the guts to go for it, to fly in the face of failure in the hope of achieving success time and time again, like serial entrepreneur Amor Sava? Entrepreneurs are a bit different, but it is a learned behavior. It's a learned behavior, and there's a lot of things you can do to improve your prospects, even if your personality doesn't quite suit this failure machine. The simplest one is just do more than one thing at a time. If you're working on a few things, they can't all be failing. Can you succeed without failure? Oh, it's so hard. The people who succeed without failure got lucky on their first roll of the dice, and they are insufferable. To err is human, and so is to try to sweep your mistakes under the carpet. Those who can face up to them and learn from them are the ones who have the best chance of achieving success. Can I be a little philosophical? Clinical psychologist Samuel West. If you take a step back and you see all these products and you can laugh at them and you can wonder what were they thinking, what's going on. But at the core, our very existence is because of failure. Evolution depends on mutations that create the failures that die off. Every now and then, there's a mutation that's a little bit more successful and survives. And because of that, we're sitting here today. So we need, for any kind of progress, we need that variation. We need those crazy, we need the Twitter peaks. It's at our core. Global business was presented by me, Ruth Alexander. The producer was John Murphy. And thank you to Frederick Sagarfalk for the music. Thanks for listening. I hope you'll learn to love your failures. I'm going to try, at least. The program was mixed by the flawless Rod Farker.
