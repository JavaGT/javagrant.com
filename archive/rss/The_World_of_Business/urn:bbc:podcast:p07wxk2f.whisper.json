This podcast is supported by advertising outside the UK. Thank you for downloading this edition of In Business. I'm John Murphy. When you think of journalists, what comes to mind? Now, let's keep it clean. There is one prejudice I'm happy to confirm. Yes, some of us do occasionally like to frequent the pub. And that's a topic I'm all too pleased to talk about. Fortunately for me, I've been given the chance of doing so. Not so long ago, this parade of shops was fairly down at heel. In fact, there's still a couple of closed shops I can see here, but opposite, there's a cafe, what I'd call a greasy spoon cafe, selling all-day breakfast next door to it, there's a dog grooming place, there's hair, nails and beauty. The old disused train station, just about 50 meters away, is now another cafe come pottery, but the important place is this one. I remember a few years ago this was where you would come to buy your bathroom taps or a new lavatory or toilet brush because it was a plumber's merchant. Then it shut down and now it's been turned into a very different kind of place. Because this is the Long Pond. It's my local, a pub. Not just any of a pub, it's a micro pub. Basically, one large-ish room and a little sort of side room. And that's it. And a blackboard with the dress written up. What are you doing? I'm making a programme about micro-pubs, yeah. All right. That's interesting. For years, I've been hearing how pubs across Britain have been closing their doors for good. In fact, we've lost more than a quarter of pubs since 2001. There are a number of reasons, including changing drinking habits, high rents, high taxes and simply unwelcoming places. But in recent years there's a type of pub that's been bucking the trend and popping up mainly in closed-down shops, the so-called micro-pub. So why are these small places working when many traditional pubs are not? Why do you come here? I just like the community spirit. I just love it. Because we just live down the road and we just come down here. It's just nice. It's just nice. And it's not noisy. I mean, it doesn't have blaring music. That's what I love a baby. You can't have your phones. There's no music. Sometimes they have live music, which is great. There's, you know, no trouble. It's just lovely. It's just like a little heartbeat. You know what I mean? And it's just nice to see the community come together. Yeah, and it's no trouble. It's just lovely. It's just like a little heartbeat. You know what I mean? And it's just nice to see the community come together. Yeah, it's really lovely. Oh, sorry. And I'll tell you what, the fella at the homes it ain't that bad either. He's all right. And there's a little bar in the corner. Behind that bar is Michael. And on the door it says. Behind that bar is Michael. And on the door it says Michael Anthony Wren, Licensed to sell intoxicating liquor for consumption. Michael, good afternoon. Hello John. Remind me, when did you open this? Five years we've been open. It took a year to set up and build and everything. Five years for you, new to you, because you weren't in this business. No, I was 30 years in finance and the finance world working in the city as a money broker. So, slightly different. But I did spend a lot of time in pubs in those days, so I knew what I wanted. When I was set up my own pub, I knew the way I wanted it, what I wanted to serve and how I wanted to serve it. So in a nutshell, what did you want? Good beer. That is the main thing. That's at the core of this business. The whole brewing industry has changed so much in the last 30 years and, what, it's changed the last 60 years. Yep, carry on. More, more clientele coming in. Come on in. Well, Mike is the pub landlord. Interruptions are to be expected. He's the only one on duty this lunchtime. Micro pub owners often rent their premises, as I say, usually former shops, and the pubs tend to have a community focus, as does the Long Pond, which is in Eltham in South East London, very close to Kent. Yes, we are a Kent themed pub as a whole. Kent beer, Kent cider, Kent crisps, Kent cheese, Kent pork pies, and Kent wine and Kent gin. The gin's a new addition. There's limited food on offer, no big brand beers. The focus is on real ale. Yet you get fine for speaking on your mobile phone. There's no jukebox, no games machines, no TV. The whole idea of the place is to encourage people to engage in conversation. It's all about conversation. Even the tables are built to a height that whether you're sitting at them or standing at them, you're always at eye level with people, rather than having low tables. Much easier to talk to someone, you look at them in the face. Four gentlemen here sitting around this table, drinking their beers. Why'd you come here? It's the quality of the beer here that's a particular draw. It's hard to imagine it being in better condition. He keeps it well, he knows what he's doing. I should point out that these three guys I'm sitting around the table with, I wouldn't have known if I hadn't come to the pond. If you hadn't come to this one? Yeah, I just made a decision to check it out and the first guy I met was Steve over there and I know Jeff and Lee purely from... Actually being able to talk to them. Yeah, yeah, that's right, yeah. Whereas there's other pubs I've been doing the past, I'll be going to for years, never made any contact with anyone. That is quite a strong point about the long pond. Any business, you know, you need to get the pricing, right? The quality of the product you're trying to sell and offer good service. And this place hits all of them. There's lots of rules and things in here, isn't it? But it maintains, like, a happy atmosphere. You get all that right, you're going to have a good business. You look after your customers, basically. As they say, at the centre of it all is good beer. The Long Pond doesn't have any taps or pumps. It all gets served from a cool room just behind the bar, kept at the optimum temperature of 12 degrees centigrade. Show me this extraordinary back room. Yes. Right. So... Because the thing about your pub is there are no pipes in effect. No, we serve directly from the cask and dispense, as it's called gravity dispense. We stick a tap into the barrel and we serve straight from there. But it also means you don't suffer from dirty pipes. Exactly. There's no pipes to clean. And also, if you've got quite a big cellar, you've got sometimes up to three or four points sitting in the pipe overnight from the cask in the cellar up to the bar. And that stuff is not always at the right temperature. And, you know, sometimes you go in have the first pint of day it can be a little bit warm and horrible yeah so we don't suffer from that at all call me biased if you like but all this effort to store the beer properly does have a noticeable impact on taste something which mike and the locals of the long pond say the large pub, which took over ownership of many pubs from breweries, have been ignoring. And it's paid dividends for micro pubs. Does this place make a profit? Oh goodness, yeah. Oh, goodness, yeah. You wouldn't be working in the city previously and not make a profit here. Oh, no, no, no, no. It makes a tidy profit, yes. You're not going to make millions or anything like that. But it it pays the bills and it gives us some you know the comfortable comfortable lifestyle Well tell me how much did it cost to get all this going? All in all a lot more than than I'd anticipated the budget in the end came to somewhere in the region of about 90,000 pounds Well quite a lot there's a lot of money yeah yeah But um see these are here I'm showing them, these are the tables. These are these are the, these are the, these are the your bespoke tables. Yeah, made in a, so yes, you've got bespoke furniture, you've got a nice floor here. Yeah, what else did you have to spend the money on? In corner room, it costs, cost, a lot of money, best part about 12,000 pounds, I think that was, yeah. Where the beer's kept. Where the beer is kept. I mean, the labour costs was, was a lot. The whole rewiring and putting the lighting in, that was well over, that part about 12,000 pounds, I think that was, yeah. Where the beer's kept. Where the beer's kept. I mean, the labour costs was a lot. The whole rewiring and putting the lighting in, that was well over, that was about 12,000 pounds, I think. Plastrian soundproofing report to appease the local environmental health. Much of the £90,000 spent came from Mike's redundancy payment from his old job in the city of London. Close friends invested another £30,000, which he was able to pay back with interest within two years. Meanwhile, 250 miles to the north in a town called Long Ridge near Preston in Lancashire, across the road from a traditional pub, is another micro pub. Dozens are shown their appreciation for the local band The Amber List, all crammed into the small space that until not so long ago was a computer repair shop. The landlady, Peace Townsend, has named her pub Hoppy Days. As we visit, they're celebrating, as she puts it, their third Hoppy birthday. Well, I grew up in Wisconsin, so there's a little bit of the link to the Happy Days TV show with that, so that's kind of where the idea came from. With Fonz. Hi. In fact, we have a beer on called Fonzarelli. What's a woman from Wisconsin doing here? That followed life's journey, really. And my partner is my husband's from the UK. So I settled over here. And that led me to finding out about real ale. It's a heritage product that you really only find in the UK, and I love celebrating it. Peace rents her premises. With savings and a bank loan, she spent 24,000 pounds, transforming this shop into a micro pub with the feel of a small cafe. Well, let's describe this room. You've got a few little circular tables, which look like traditional pub little tables and stools. You have your bar there. You have green walls. Yes, yes. Very vivid green walls. But it doesn't look like a normal pub, does it? No, and I think that's one of the joys of having your own micro pub and your own space is you can really put your stamp on it. I find that a lot of micro pubs reflect the owners a lot and what they're interested in. In fact, you're wearing a green dress. Well, I thought I would color coordinate. But the reason I chose green is one of the things that's a little bit difficult for me with the streetscape here is everything is very neutral in color. And I like bright colors to offset the gray skies, you know, kind of uplifting and positive. What is the central ethos? I wanted to provide a convivial atmosphere for people to come together in a nice social space. So I do have what I refer to as my manners policy. So we've kind of always from the start had our... You're pointing for the wall. I am pointing to the wall and just said to support a convivial atmosphere where folks feel welcome and comfortable, please refrain from using loud, vulgar or offensive language. But we do venture on politics and religion, but if tempers start flaring then I just say it's time to switch the subject and people do. I listen to the landlady. Well, one of my past careers was as an elementary school teacher. And in a way, running a micro pub isn't a huge step away from running a classroom. While Pice's approach and her rules may not be to everyone's taste, it's certainly winning her loyal custom. Are you customers? We are. And friends. Hi, guys. Would you customers? We are. And friends. Hi guys. Would you like a drink, ladies? It's not even though. Come on. I don't. The two keen customers are both called Helen. So what do you recommend, Pea? Helen, this one is absolutely for you. Okay. I know you well enough to know that. A blonde for a redhead. Yeah, blonde for a redhead. There you go. So that's the other thing about you and these kind of places is that you know your customers. Yeah, it doesn't take too many visits to develop a good report. We really specifically focus on getting to know people's names and understanding anything from what type of glass they like, what styles they like. So it's a lot about sort of sharing the passion of the real ale and making sure everybody's having the experience they want with it. These two Helens have cut. Well, just wait, this is Helen as well. So behind the bar, another Helen. Are you regulars here? Yeah, I come down generally on a Friday evening. I walk down, I live up in the Fowls. I was never a beer drinker, really. I was more wine and you gin. But, of course, coming in here, I just have to walk in and peace will know straight away what she's got on in the pumps and she'll say, you'll really like this woman, 100% she's always right. But yes, come down for the good conversation, the laughs, meet some very interesting people in here and I always know that on a Friday night there'll be some topic of conversation that I will leave and I'll know a bit more about it or I will have given my opinion about something. So, yeah, it's absolutely wonderful. It's great to come down to good local pub. The Helen's told me they never used to be pub goers and Hoppy Days doesn't really feel like a pub. It's cozier, friendlier. There are Spanish classes you can sign up for, a sign language course, and coach trips to breweries. But is this tiny business model sustainable? So is this place making a profit? I would always a little bit of a profit. One of my other micro pub owner friends is you're never going to make a fortune doing this. It's more of a lifestyle. And so I'm able to pay my two part-time staff. So that feels really good as well to be able to provide some jobs to a few good people in the community. I pay myself a very small wage, less than what I pay my employees. As the business grows, I certainly will look forward to being able to pay myself a little bit more. You say as it grows, is it growing? It is slowly year on year. It's a small town that we're in due to grow quite a lot with all the houses being built around. Pubs in general in Britain, in the UK, have been doing, or we read a lot about them doing badly. Many of the traditional pubs shutting down. Micro pubs on the other hand, doing quite well. Why are you more successful than the ones pubs shutting down. Micro pubs on the other hand doing quite well. Why are you more successful than the ones that are shutting down? I think I have a very different economic situation to a more traditional pub. My impression is that one of the big struggles is being a tied pub, tied to a brewery or a pub company that requires you to purchase all of your goods through their system at a much increased price. When I talk to people that are in the traditional pub trade, and they're being hamstrung by the exorbitant costs that they're required to pay for their goods. And also when they're successful, their rent goes up. So they're almost penalized for being successful. Do you think there's something that micro pubs can teach those bigger traditional pubs? What I would like to think is that by micro pubs coming in and offering something different, that it maybe raises the standard and raises the bar a bit for other traditional pubs that may have rested a bit on their laurels in terms of how they treat the customer, what they're offering the customer and price. If we just start, I think maybe through around this way, we could just say a little about your name, a little bit about the group that you're working for, your interest. In the west of England in Bath, we're in a much more traditional large pub, the Bell Inn, serving a wide range of drinks. A workshop is underway in a back room for people who want to learn how to take over and run a pub. And I have to kind of say to you that do talk to other groups because in my experience... While many micro pubs have a very local focus, this place is perhaps even more about community, because it's a community-owned pub. And these are ordinary people, non-publicans, trying to save their local pub, like Peter Emerson and Aileen Fenland from Chitton on Salisbury Plain. Theirs is a small village with just over 300 residents. We've come here today because there's one pub in our village and it's due to close in two weeks time. Two weeks? Two weeks. The pub has been in the village for 300 years. It's served the community for all that time and I think we're really aware that once it closes, if we don't buy it then it's going to go likely for change of use. We'll have lost the pub forever. I don't want to be the generation that lost Chitton, its pub. Change of use basically means turning it into housing. Yeah, I think inevitably that would be what would happen. It's all we have, really. The village shop closed about five years ago. So we feel that if we can save the pub, we can perhaps have a little bolt-on shop as well. Do you know how much money your village would have to raise to actually buy this place? It's on the market for over 300,000 pounds. And there are only 300 of you or so, 300 odd or so. Oh yes, you never know. There must be some wealthy people out there in that village that might want to put their hands in their pockets. Do you think, oh goodness me, this is a heck of a struggle we've got ahead of us, or do you think this is great, great challenge? I think it's absolutely terrifying. But if you don't give it a try, then you never know. Good luck. Thank you. Come and have a pint when we're open. It might seem a lot to tackle, but the Plunkett Foundation, which helps rural communities set up community-owned businesses like shops and pubs, says people are doing this all the time, and with great success. While the others were in the workshop, I caught up with Hannah Barrett from Plunkett. This is a group of new groups that come together, but also established pub groups so they can all talk and they can share their ideas and really understand what community-owned businesses are because they are a relatively unknown business model. Has there been a recent growth in them? Yes, absolutely. We've seen recently there has been significantly more community pubs being set up. Is it 25% of pubs have closed since 2001? So there's opportunities for communities. They're getting excited. They're getting excited, they're getting angry, they're getting upset about these changes within their own communities and they're coming together and saying, well, we're going to do this for ourselves and we'll create a pub that is ours. So you don't just get a beer in most of the community pubs, you actually get a perhaps a yoga studio or a young mum's club or you get an elderly lunch club or you get a dementia friendly session or post offices or bank services. So they become perhaps a yoga studio or a young mum's club or you get an elderly lunch club or you get a dementia friendly session or post offices or bank services so they become community hubs driven by the community for the community what is the success rate a hundred percent long-term success rate 100 percent not one failure not one failure no not at the moment and we have had a few pubs that have transitioned back into private ownership, but that is a couple and we would still say that is a saved pub. You know, they're still running it as a pub. The first community pub was set up three decades ago. There are now more than 100 trading in the UK. Back inside the workshop, the delegates are putting their questions to the owners of the Berlin, locals who saved their local from closure. We have a number of people who are willing to invest 20, 30, 40,000, but they feel that gives them more than one vote over people who invest five. Yeah, well, we had that argument in this very room. Fielding the questions is Steve Henwood, the man who first had the idea to save the bell in. I sat down with him and his colleague Wendy Matthews. It all happened so quickly and so frantically. It was kind of like running a local political campaign in a way. You start with a few people and more people come in and people are ringing you up and asking how they can help. Luckily for them, a number of local pop stars gave their support, and they soon had a massive campaign going. They had to raise a lot of money, almost a million pounds. They launched a share offer. Each share cost a pound, but you had to buy a minimum of 500. In just a few weeks, they'd raised more than £700,000 through the share issue. An extra $250,000 came from a bank loan. The pub is now run as a cooperative. Each member has one vote, no matter how many shares they bought. They also get returns from their investment. We were a group of people who don't run pubs, who are now running a pub, and you've got to learn all that even though the pub was running quite profitably you've still got to get your head around all the HR aspects and the you know what are we buying the right beer and all this sort of stuff which I think that's the long slog I'd say you need to learn to own a business to me that's one of the great things about community ownership is actually more members of the general public are getting to learn from the inside how a business works. There is no single template for setting up a community pub or how to run it. Similarly, micro pubs defy strict definition. The owners put their own stamp on this. So I'm going to grab the keys. So this is it? This is our delightful little unit at the moment. Chichester in Sussex. Oh, yeah. Absolutely. There haven't been in it for a while, have we? No, not for a while, because it's been a long process to get here. It's been a very long process. To deal with the change of usage first. New micro pubs are opening all the time. There are now more than 500 across the UK. Steve Pottinger and Tom Owen intend to transform this place into the latest one, called the escapist. Well, we're both sort of escapists, really, because we've both had numerous careers and then tried to escape from them. We're all escapist when we're in the pub, aren't we? Steve and Tom have had a variety of jobs. They've both been barman. Steve's been a semi-professional musician and Tom has run a pop-up events business. Now they've got planning permission to convert this former vintage clothing shop into their idea of what a pub should be, but it's not a big place. I mean, it's one room. There's a tiny little side room with a sink, I can see. Currently, that's going to be knocked out. You'll have a big square room. Ideally, where this block is is where our bar's going to be. In the corner here, coming along this wall here. So where are you going to store your beer? Well, this is... Or your drinks, whatever you're going to do. There'll be a certain amount behind the bar, and we're going to have some creative story solutions because as you can see it's going to be, it's going to be tricky. It's quite tight. It is tight, yeah. And that's going to be one of our main challenges. It's a micro pub, isn't it? Are you just doing Kars beer or are you going to do cake? There'll be a little bit of both. Yeah. Which again presents another challenge because it's going to be stored slightly differently. Yeah. You can hear Michaelael my landlord here from the long pond coming to inspect this new establishment or this new potential micro pub yeah mike goes for real ales essentially you two you're 30 years old i know and you're 35 yeah somewhat younger than mike and i are you going for some sort of younger youthier kind of market with different kinds of drinks or what? I think we'll bridge the gap. We're not, we don't want to just go solely down and pigeonhole ourselves as purely a camera pub or purely something a little bit more quirky. Camera being the campaign for real ale. Yeah, um, we want to try and do a bit of everything and be on be hipster either. Do you say, no, no, exactly. This whole idea started from bridging the gap of being the age of Tom and I are and going, I don't know where I fancy a bit. Like you know, I don't want to go to a in advertiser comers an old man's pub and I don't want to go to some swanky, super loud, pumping music, hipsy bar. So it's that, it's bridging that gap and almost being the anarchist of the micro pub if you like. Let's talk about the drink ultimately, this is what these places are supposed to be about. What kind of advice can you give them about the drink, the array of drinks? Well, I was given a good bit of advice by the bloke which started the whole thing off, Martin Hillier. Have you heard of him? First micro pub in Kent, actually. Yeah, and he said, right, this beer's got to be sold, you know, three or four days, that's it. So everything else you're offering, someone has a pint of cider or whatever,'re not drinking the beer so you've got to be so careful about how many beers you have on there's no secret to be a apart from keep at the right temperature and selling it and that is that is it and using good breweries absolutely let's talk the dirty business of money how much money is gonna go into this to transform this room this Let's talk to the dirty business of money. How much money is going to go into this to transform this room, this place into your micro? An initial 15K is the goal and we want to stick within that. We've got an investor friend of ours who has an extra 5K should we need it for a percentage of the business. But we want to try and keep it under 15. That's a tall order. Without space for a cool room, they'll need to find alternatives to keep their beer fresh. Finances aside, Mike has another bit of advice for them. The only thing I would say is another important factor. And I know you probably have got the room, is for a separate toilet for ladies, because so many women oh don't not go there because it was one of the things my wife straight away talked about but i think that's one of those things we've got to be on top of every you know every hour just go and give it a white around the cleaner and make sure it's tidy do you know what i mean and i think that and i like to hope as well being the it's not you know 20 drunk lads you know we're all over the shop you're, it's not, you know, 20 drunk lads, you know, we're all over the shop you're hoping it's going to be kept in some sort of half-decent state. So, yeah. People who can aim. Yeah, people who can aim, exactly. They're dance players. Good luck, guys. Thank you very much. Last door to the bar, good ladies gentlemen. Last all to the bar. Back at the Long Pond in South East London, there's still a bit of business to do before closing time. The well-kept beers and small selection of wines seem popular. Mike's just added a couple of single malt whiskeys to his drinks list. That's one thing about both community-owned pubs and micro-pubs. They're close to their clientele, often on first-name terms. As businesses, they can be more nimble adapting to their market demands. Also, micro-pubs in particular don't have the overheads, the high rent or staffing costs of larger traditional pubs. In some ways, there are a return to the old days, where local was king, and through their emphasis on quality of product, they can teach the bigger players a lesson. It's time, make it good, gentlemen. Start bringing up now, please, thank you. It's time. Oh, too late for a pint then. I'm John Murphy. The producer was Ruth Alexander. Morgan Roberts made it all sound smooth, and Penny Murphy is the series editor. There are plenty of other programmes on this World of Business podcast. I made one about berries. How do we get them 365 days a year? And who's going to pick them? And just as another example, there's one about the future of flying."}
