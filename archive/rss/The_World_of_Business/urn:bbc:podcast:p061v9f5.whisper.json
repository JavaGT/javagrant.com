You can find them ploughing furrows from Cuba to China. Wedged between Russia and Poland, Belarus has long been called Europe's last dictatorship, a country with a reputation for Soviet-era secrecy and isolation. But now it's relaxed its visa regime and the country's being rebranded as a dynamic hub for business and tourism. So the MTZ tractor works have opened their doors as part of this new countrywide charm offensive, and I've decided to peek inside. tractor works have opened their doors as part of this new countrywide charm offensive and I've decided to peek inside. I'm Lucy Ash and for global business I'm in Belarus visiting one of the largest manufacturers of its kind in the world. It produces tractors for every climate on the planet, from fields of wheat to corn to sugar cane and rice. Built on the foundations of an old aircraft factory, this place has survived the rule of seven Soviet leaders, the collapse of Soviet power, the coming of capitalism, and the global financial crash. This is basically a whole city in itself, in which you can find everything, a city within a city. In fact, it's a Soviet-era megalopolis. As well as all the casting shops, warehouses and assembly lines, there are flats and dormitories, a football stadium, restaurants, kindergartens, a palace of culture, and clinics, all laid on for the 18,000 tractor workers. Here I work about 100 doctors, 100, yeah. A big polyclinic. Yeah. For example, cardiologist, rheumatologist, endocrinologist, pulmonologist, dermatologist, gastrologist, yeah. Dermatologist. Dermatologist, yeah, infection. What's it like to work in this big wheeled world wedged between Russia and the European Union? Can it survive the pressures of the 21st century? Or will it soon be consigned to the scrap heap by a burgeoning virtual economy. The factory known as MTS in the Belarusian capital Minsk has been producing tractors since 1946 when Stalin set it up to help feed the famished USSR at the end of the Second World War. They say that one in ten of the world's tractors still bears the stamp Belarus. The main assembly line, half a kilometre long. All around me, women are climbing into gleaming, scarlet, nearly finished tractors to polish levers, gear sticks and headlights. I've just met a lady on the production line with blonde hair called Liena. He's been working here for 30 years. Yes, this year. I am a sitter on the assembly line. That is my job. And I met my husband here. He works for the factory too, but not in this part. No, no, no, no. I basically grew up in this factory. My mother took me to the factory for the first time when I was eight. Vasily Gnachik, a square-jawed man with chestnut eyes, now heads the factory's design bureau. There were little shards or shavings of metal on the factory floor. I liked their bright colors, so I picked them up and took them home. I dreamt of being an engineer, and I succeeded, and I am proud of it. So it's quite emotional seeing a finished tractor for you, even now. When tractors, bus goad from conveyor, of course, when the tractor rolls off the production line, red and shining, it is an unforgettable sight. It's notewable. Jobs in factories like this one came with a social contract. Free health care, childcare, holidays for children and subsidized housing were all standard. Tens of millions of Soviet citizens once took that contract for granted. But in this day and age, is it viable? Yes, well, unlike the other countries of the former Soviet Union, we kept our main production sites and factories, because our country is not rich in natural resources, so we have been forced to survive thanks to our industry. And our machine-building factories have stayed in government ownership, but despite that, we make products which are competitive. Maybe we could pay our workers higher wages they now get an average of twelve hundred rubles or six hundred dollars a month but the economic policies of our government are focused on support for the population, so we maintain this social infrastructure. Do you think you can carry on like that in the future, though? Well, it depends on the government and their politics. Modern conditions may demand other priorities, and our leadership will doubtless take responsible decisions. I sense that chief engineer Vasili doesn't really want to get drawn into politics. Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko, himself a former collective farm boss, has been plowing the same furrow for decades, the autocratic tractor driver of the state. Vasili, like many here, is convinced though that stability comes first, given the experience of the state. Vasili, like many here, is convinced, though, that stability comes first, given the experience of neighboring countries. If you look at what has been happening in the Russian Federation and in Ukraine since the fall of the USSR, their process of fast privatisation meant most people got much poorer. But we, Belarusians, were spared that sharp drop in living standards. And we didn't have to suffer all that anxiety. This country has long been derided for being stuck in a Soviet time warp, with its secret police still called the KGB, its heavy-handed approach to dissent, its statues of Lenin and its centrally controlled economy. Stenton enterprises for a long time, they were heavily subsidized by the state, and it led to several currency crises. Economist Alexander Chubrik has beening Belarusian industry since the 1990s. In six years, Belarus passed through three currency crises, like one after the other. It was because of the huge support to the state-owned enterprises. But finally, in the end of 2014, the authorities realized that, okay, they cannot continue like this, because in order to finance all these imbalances, external imbalances, we borrowed quite heavily. So the future of the state-owned enterprise sector in Belarus is like this. Some companies will survive, and some companies will slowly die. The factory does still get low-interest loans, but the generous state subsidies of the old days have all but dried up. So, is it time to sink or swim? Oh my god, it's very high up. It's almost like being on the top deck of a double-decker bus. As I'm going along in this big 3522 Belarus red tractor, what we're driving down now is the avenue of honour. this big 3522 Belarus red tractor. What we're driving down now is the avenue of honour. There are photographs of model workers, people who have done especially well in sales targets or on the shop floor. There are machinery workers, secretaries, shop stewards. There are very few workers still around who remember the birth of the factory 72 years ago. We've come to meet Yevgeny Dmitrovich now in his 80s. The tractor plant has framed his whole life. Ten. Twelve. Twelve. has framed his whole life. 12. 12. I was born in here. I was born in in 177 in settlement, inampianca, in town, Minsk. During the war, I lived with my grandmother. What did we eat? Well, granny gathered potatoes. But they were rotten, and I can still feel that taste in my mouth we were only saved by the fact that she had a cow but it was hard to find any corn or animal feed my father brought me to Minsk because he was working here after the war ended. I was nine years old. The city was in ruins. Thousands of German prisoners of war were still held in Minsk, working to rebuild the Belarusian capital. They were living on the site of the tractor factory. And I remember on Saturday they came to the stadium with the orchestra. They played really well. It was a brass band and they played football. They seemed friendly and they gave us whistles and pocket knives. I don't know what was in the hearts of the grown-ups and means. And they gave us whistles and pocket knives. I don't know what was in the hearts of the grown-ups in Minsk at that time, how they felt. But to us boys, the Germans were just Germans. And in 49, they were sent home. The factory arising from the ashes of Minsk was a beacon of modernism and prosperity, tractors were the iron horses of communism riding inexorably towards a bright future. Young Yevgeny slipped in just to gop at the new steel workshop when he was 16, and he landed a job there not long afterwards. The steel workshop is where they mold metal. The steel workshop is where they mold metal. It's where some of the heaviest work is done, you understand. It made me feel like a real man, and I stayed for 42 years. In that time, Hvgeny Dmitrovich married a seamstress and had five children. Some worked in the factory, some elsewhere, but the tractor plant provided stability and the prospect of better things to come. It was great having a swimming pool at the factory. I used to go every day when my shift finished. I like front crawl the most. You go faster. MTZ supplied a captive market in communist states from Cuba to China. The glory days were under Leonid Brezhnev when the factory celebrated its millionth tractor. And by 1984, the figure was already double that, with its MTZ80 model becoming the most commonplace tractor in the world. But these days it's hard to compete with the high-tech wizardry and robot workers of the US tractor giant John Deere, or the Indian conglomerate Mahindra. Yet MTZ is still in demand, says Chief Engineer Vasili Gneddi US tractor giant John Deer, or the Indian conglomerate Mahindra. Yet MTZ is still in demand, says Chief Engineer Vasili Gnetschik. We have customers on every continent, apart from the Antarctic. We supply about 60 different countries. A Belarus tractor is the right balance of price and quality. It has quite a simple design and it's valued for its reliability, simplicity and efficiency. Economist Alexander Chubrick is optimistic. In terms of tractor plants, I strongly believe, not believe, but I'm sure that this company can continue to operate in market environment. If they will restructure business, if they will change approaches to management, and if the state will allow this company to operate without like different kind of state orders and even without the state support. So okay, some package of measures for restruction of this company, it may work. One thing that hasn't yet been restricted at MTZ is the generous social infrastructure provided for workers. 20 little girls in leggings and leotards are rehearsing for a dance competition. This is the MTZ Palace of Culture, built in 1965. It's got a marble entrance hall and orange stained glass windows. There are rehearsal rooms, dance studios and a concert hall. Okay, so who can speak English? Yes. Yes. How old are you? I'm 11. I'm 10. 11. 10 and 11, yeah? Anybody 12? No. No? No. Diana, one of the least shy dancers, has long blonde hair and a pink t-shirt with butterflies. To understand more about how the traditional social contract works for families, we later drop in on her mother, Anja, and her dad Sergei, who's fresh off the evening shift. We live in a hostel for trucker factory workers, and we have two rooms, and the little one slips in with us. Anya rolls her eyes when she's talking about sharing a kitchen and a bathroom with others on the landing. They've been waiting for their own flat for more than a decade, but there's little new housing being built by MTS these days. Sergei's work for the factory ever since he finished his military service 13 years ago. It's hard physical work, not the easiest, but what can you do? I'm a machinist. I put the metal wings over the big wheel painted and then it's ready one person puts the headlights on another the wheel you know it's a teamwork of course we get out for celebrations birthdays and etc our collective doesn't change much it's not like it used to be, of course, when we had four shifts at the factory around the clock, and now we only have two. In the old days, we turned out 50,000 tractors, and now the maximum is around 30,000, maybe 35,000. The pay is not that great, but at least you can rely on it being there. You know that on a certain date the money will come in. There are some jobs where there is no guarantee at all. Just now I'm on maternity leave. I get three years. The social benefits are really good at the factory, especially if you have small children. Our daughter gets to the holiday camp once a year and the factory pays for it. There is a holiday resort. You can get a bus there from the factory. You can get massages there and everything. And we have lots of amazing celebrations. New Year is great with fireworks, laser show, the lot. In May comes the track to works anniversary. Then in September, that's the day of the machine builders. Three or four years ago, lots of people were leaving the factory. They said, what are you sticking around there for? There isn't any future of the factory. But now they have tried out the private sector. They want their old jobs back. Sergei talks scornfully about the types who want to keep their hands nice and soft, but there are a growing number of alternatives to factory work in Belarus. You haven't played World of Tanks yet? You're wasting your life. Because in World of Tanks, you can shoot on the move, shoot on the spot, shoot in the sky, run over pumpkins, Destroy private property. It's a snowy Friday morning and we've driven about half an hour south of the centre of Minsk. I'm standing in front of a sparkling glass building in the shape of a wave. There are white buses turning up with wargaming net on them because this is a huge video gaming company. Nice to meet you. Maria, let me give your passes. Okay, and so it says in big letters above the reception desk, wargaming.net and then underneath let's battle. So that's your slogan, let's battle. Yeah, let's battle. Right. We have this quick 15 minutes battle in world of tanks, planes or ships so you just jump into a vehicle and battle And those are the the logos of the game trilogy that we have so in the middle this is world of tanks What of war planes on the left and will of warships on the right This is one of the meeting rooms and we have this lounge area so people can collaborate and work together. Seats in the lounge chill-out area, they're sort of designed like tanks, car key green, with fuel tanks strapped on the back. It's a kind of cross between 21st century chill-out zone and World War II, yeah? Correct. So we try to design our walking place to fit the games we work on. Wargaming CEO Victor Kisli is one of Belarus's first billionaires. The company's best-selling product, the multiplayer competitive game World of Tanks, has over 160 million registered players, and it's one of the world's top 10 games on PC. I'm James Bertels. I'm the global copywriter for World of Tanks. So I've worked in the Minsk office for a couple of weeks, but I've worked for wargaming Europe for the last three years. So we have almost 600 tanks, all 3D-modelled, and we have tanks from nine nations. We're currently looking at a British tank here. Can you just explain to me like how do I shoot? It's really easy you just aim your mouse. Do I aim the mouse at the red triangles? Yes, yes. Shooting accurately is tricky but it's not as fast and furious as games like Call of Duty. World of tanks is mainly played, I'm told, by middle-aged men with a penchant for military history. It's a bit unnerving to watch these tanks rumbling through fields and towns blowing each other to bits when you think that Belarus was destroyed so utterly during the real tank battles of the Second World War. But of course, this is a virtual world and a heavily sanitized one. I would generally think it's bad to show blood and killing people. To let our players kill people, I think it's not even a good idea. Machine is just a machine. The machine can be like anything, like a truck or plane or tank. The machine is not alive. Marat Carpeco, suave, sharp suited, he's the head of the Minsk office and co-founder of War Gaming. He and Victor Kisli began the company as Games Mad students and together created the largest game publisher to emerge from the former Eastern Bloc. The company draws on Soviet strengths such as high-quality maths teaching. Belarus is a prominent player in a global software developing IT market. Have a lot of maybe like 100,000 software engineers in Belarus and our universities. Every year provide more. So we kept that and improved that Soviet Union legacy. The company, which is headquartered in Cyprus, is sleek, focused and sensitive to the slightest tremor in the market. We know everything, because that's our business. When they play, is it like morning, afternoon, from work or from home, what kind of computer do they have? So we have to tune our games to the specification of their computers. We need to understand, like, are we competing with other games or with TV? What other activities are like to do? So we try to lure them into the game instead of maybe going to cinema. So we can understand, I would say, complete lifestyle of our players. So they really like coming to our game again and again. As well as its customers, including President Lukashenko's teenage son, war gaming is also keen to hang on to its 2,000 young, techie, Minsk-based employees. It's been voted the best employer in the country several years running. Our industry, everywhere in Minsk as well, it's very competitive. So there are so many companies competing for the best employees. There is actually a shortage of talent. So we have to provide them all kinds of benefits and perks which they are used to. Otherwise, they will just go to our competitors. Are these virtual tanks designed for entertainment destined to replace the solid metal tractors at MTZ. I talked to economist Alexander Chubrick over a cappuccino in the city center. Things are moving in two different ways. There are two different parts of the society, two different parts of the economy. You came to the Minsk structure plant and you came to Minsk Office of Wargaming Company. So you have dual economy, dual society like these divisions. Private sector now takes, according to different estimates, about half of the economy, at least. The biggest employer now is private company, not state-owned companies. What Alexander says is a real surprise to me. World Bank consultants failed to impose a free market model here, and paradoxically, keeping a state-run economy may actually have helped Belarus grow a thriving startup scene in ways few could have foreseen back in the 1990s. There is even one advantage in non-privatizing at that time. What kind of advantage? In Russia, mass privatization. In Ukraine, mass privatization. What happened, the best entrepreneurs tried to recover, probably not very alive enterprises. But in Belarus, it was not allowed to privatize. And brightest minds, brightest entrepreneurs, they started to establish business from scratch and could compete at external markets. What you're saying, Alexandra, is that if you wanted to be an entrepreneur to create something new from scratch, you had a better chance of doing it here in Belarus than in Russia or Ukraine? I think yes. And one of the reasons is definitely, in terms of corruption, we look great. So it's not such a huge issue here? Absolutely, absolutely. So why it is much lower here? We don't have oligarchs like in Russia. So they are not struggling for resources. Okay, there is a struggle, but it is in a much smaller scale. And so, dynamic enterprises keep springing up around old dinosaurs like MTZ. Maybe one day the streets and blocks around the tractor factory will be full of programmers sitting in hip coffee bars, which have ripped out the parquet and exposed the beams. But for now, this neighborhood east of the city center is solid working class, small supermarkets selling vodka to men coming off their shifts, tired women pushing prams or lugging their shopping down machinist street. Well, the years just flew by. Now I'm 81 years now I'm 81 years old. Now my great-grandchildren are appearing. Spring is on the way and there will be lots of work to do in the Dutch. Yevgeny shows us his hero of socialist labour medal. His children have reaped the benefit of stable employment and his grandchildren have set their sights far beyond tractors. One granddaughter, he proudly tells me, is defending her dissertation on cultural exchange programmes, another's in nursing, another in engineering, another in tourism. Meanwhile, Yevgeny, a widower after a long, happy marriage, keeps close to his factory friends. On Sundays, I go to dancers for the over 50s. I go with a lady friend of mine. I call her up, tell her to get ready, and off we go. Can I imagine my life without the factory? No, but I think everything worked out for the best. If I could live my life over again, I would do everything the same. Global business was presented by me, Lucy Ash. The producer is Monica Whitlock. Thanks for listening.
