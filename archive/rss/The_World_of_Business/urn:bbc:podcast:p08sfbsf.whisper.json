Well, it's been about six months since this place has been open, as it says on the window here, traditional alehouse, or a micro pub, which in this case specialises in beers from Kent. It's the long pond, and as anybody who's listened to in business before might realise, it's also my local. I'm revisiting some of the businesses I spoke to at the beginning of lockdown in March and April to see what they've done to survive, including this watering hole still in business. Magic moments to the venture. Hello, John. Hello Michael. Come in. Good afternoon. Please wait here to be seated. Gosh, it looks different. Well, these plastic screens. And the hard, they're soft. But it's a big day. It's our official opening of the five months. Well, five and a bit months, isn't it? Coming up to six. Michael Wrens the owner of this family-run enterprise in Eltham in South East London. So, why are you opening now? Well, we've monitored the situation since the pubs opened, you know, to see how many people were actually using it. Because the main reason we hadn't opened before was we didn't think we'd have to get enough people in to make it financially worthwhile. But we've had a jiggle around, as you can see. We've moved a lot of tables about. You've removed the piano, I can see. We've moved the piano, we've moved the barrel. We've moved some tables of tables about... You've removed the piano, I can see. We've removed the piano, we've moved the barrel. We've moved some tables from inside the Dorchester room. Which is this other little offshoot room. The snug, yeah. For the posh people, like you, John. And we actually can seat 40 people, which is more than we thought. 40? Yeah. Well, that's if everybody's sitting together in social household bubbles, whatever. You know, alternatively we could have nine tables, we have one person each table and then we're still full up, you know, so. So you could have very few or very many? Yes, yes indeed, yeah. So tell me what are the rules, what are the absolute rules? Once you arrive, you're, you're designated a table and we are taking book first. You don't have to book, but it helps you do it. I mean, you know, it's a Monday night, it's not our business night and we're virtually fully booked already from 5 o'clock. We come to you to take your orders and then bring them to the table. You remain at your table, you don't walk around, going to other tables and mixing with, or getting too close to other people. So if you see a mate across the room, you can wave and you can, you know, you can talk, yeah. But you don't get up and go and sit with them. And of course, track and trace. Will you be patrolling like a rot viro? Absolutely, yes. Yes, ready to pull anyone up who falls foul of our rules, yeah. Now, I know how you've survived thus far, but tell the listeners. By offering a full, free delivery service of beer and wine to the local community, to our local postcode and beyond a bit. Including to my house. Including to your house, John, regularly, sometimes in the middle of the night. That's not true by the way. Yeah, April, May, June was just absolutely crazy. Our turnover was up 20% during the height of that period. When you mean turnover, you mean the amount of stuff you were selling? Yeah, the volume, yeah. But not necessarily the money you were making. The profit margins on the beer we were selling, there's many casts. It wasn't as, you know, it wasn't as good as it was on the beer. But then I'd cost me down. You know, we had no staff. It was just me doing it with my son, helping out now and then. Despite the pub reopening, you're going to still have deliveries. Yeah, because there are customers I know who are not ready to come back. Now you're about to officially open your doors. Yeah, we've got the mayor of Greenwich booked a table at 5 o'clock. How do you actually feel about it? Yeah, I'm looking forward to seeing people tonight. Yeah. From booze to buttons and bobbins. Here we go. I was last here five months ago in April, just off Oxford Street in central London, standing outside this shop. McCulloch and Wallace Limited, established 1902, Fabrics, Haberdashery. And now on the glass here, there are various signs. Face coverings are mandatory in this store all mask materials available here an array of look at me don't look at me fabrics 15 minute in store time limit so that means people can go in but only for a quarter of an hour and very, very chic. And very, very chic. Good morning. Thank you. You're very coordinated. shirt and face mask in the same material. Obviously. Do you not have these kinds of standards of the BBC? Seems not. Victoria Connolly is the co-owner and director of this place, which sells anything you might need to make whatever you might want to wear, including Victoria's matching top and face mask, both dark blue with little white sharks on. I've had a lot of time to sew in the last few months. It's what my people expect. So you have a door man? Yes, it's very important. His job is to, you know, talk down the people who refuse to wear a mask. Part of the problem for us is that a lot of the customers don't seem to understand that the restrictions are actually not imposed by us and that creates a bit of a problem. A bit of tension with your customers. A bit of attention with our customers. Last time I was here the shop was closed. Just three staff including Victoria were in processing mail order sales, which were up significantly. Naturally, shop sales were non-existent. So what's the position now they've reopened the doors? I think we probably in the last couple of months turned over about maybe less than a third of what we normally would. Are you getting enough custom coming in? We actually have 100 customers a day, which is the upper limit, based on how many people we're letting in and how long we're letting them spend. At any one time, yes. We haven't been selling as much fabric as normal because most of that goes to fashion students, but they all vanished in April. Hopefully they'll be back. And people weren't having weddings either. So not making wedding dresses. No weddings, but also the theatre business is a big part of our business. So the fabric doing not so well? The fabric's doing not so well, but it's doing well enough. It seems to be picking up. There's quite a lot of theatrical companies elsewhere who seem to be buying here. Greece, Denmark, Finland. Other European countries. Yeah, who seem to be putting on productions, or at least making costumes. So we've got a big potential order for pinstripe wool from the Greek national opera, which is sort of surprising, but, you know, I'm not going to argue. And we sell a lot of velvet to people who make boxes for cufflinks, also surprising. So there's a few things like that. What are you showing me? I'm showing me how much tidier it is the last time you came. Gosh it is. You used to have boxes all over the floor. Hello. Hello. Two people are allowed down here. It looks like a big space. It is a big space, but it has no vent. A big space but with lots of product in it, taking up a lot of the space. Yes. Hats, ribbons, zips, buttons over there, threads, threads. Chains. Chains, for those who like that kind of thing. We are in Soho. So what's the biggest, being the biggest problem for you? Well, the biggest problem is balancing the number of staff we need with the space we have, because we can only have so many staff in the building and so many customers. Fifteen of the staff were on furlough during lockdown. Now half of them are back at work, but taking any more back could be difficult. Right now we can't let them in because the government restrictions won't let us have any more staff, in fact. Because of social distancing. Because of social distancing, so we can't actually take them back even if we needed to. There will be a point where we will be paying people not come to work. And of course in the long term you can't keep paying people to stay at home. No, but we'll see. It's not clear what will happen when the furlough scheme officially finishes at the end of October. So far, McCulloch and Wallace have managed to pay their £15,000 a month rent, and they've had a holiday from business rates. But there's another big bill around the corner. And then there's corporation tax, but that's not due to January. The bill is based on last year's pre-COVID sales. It comes in January or something. 50 grand. Give or fake. The corporation tax will be 50 grand. Yeah. More or less. Looking forward to that? Yeah. January, it'll be fine. By January, we'll be, yeah. It'll be swimming in money. We'll be swimming in money will be swimming in money exactly that's she says with her fingers crossed yes so do you feel a bit better about the business now than you did I'm more cheerful yeah as I can tell So we grow this year will grow about 3,000 tonnes of raspberries, and about 1,500 tons of strawberries. And right now are you in the middle of the picking season for both raspberries and strawberries? Yeah, the busiest point of the year for us is when we're picking all the crops. So that will be raspberries, strawberries, blueberries, blackberries, cherries, and red currents. Tim Chambers grows berries for the supermarkets on 17 sites dotted across central and northern Kent. In winter he imports and packs fruit from places like Spain and Morocco, even South America, to keep demand satisfied. This is certainly not traditional farming, it's agribusiness and on this track where I am, as far as I can see, there are these massive plastic covered polytunnels. And each of those polytunnels stretches off again into the distance, about 200 meters. And at shoulder height there's a sea of green leaves. These are strawberry plants. There are some beautiful little white flowers sticking up, which will eventually turn into fruit. And hanging down, there are lots of green strawberries, but every now and then I can see a delicious-looking red one. The last time I met Tim in April, he was worried about getting his fruit pickers in. Most of them come from Eastern Europe, predominantly from Bulgaria and Romania. So what happened? There were a few issues early on with the actual transport wasn't available for them. Flights weren't available and airports were closing down. But by chartering planes, you could get flights coming. And how much did that cost? A flight to charter a flight from, I think it was Bucharest or Sofia into Gatwick, cost about 45 grand. So just over £200 per person is the cost for a one-way flight on a charter direct from Eastern Europe. What about, you know, the obvious question, British workers. A lot of people were hanging around, lost their jobs. Yeah. There was a lot of people furloughed, a lot of students looking for work. For our business, we took, I think, over 2,000 inquiries. And when we sent back more details about the actual, more the details of the work, that enthusiasm rapidly tailed off. In fact, the numbers quickly dropped to 150. So what is it British workers don't like? They don't like the length of hours that we would work. We're often starting at 5 o'clock in the morning, so that really means you need to be at the farm at least 4.45, so that means you've got to get up at 4 o'clock. That wasn't very appealing. The fact that we pay minimum wage, but you have peace rates so that you can actually earn more than the minimum wage if you pick faster. People didn't really understand that and the minimum wage for a lot of them really wasn't that appealing either. We had we had a number of emails coming back which said when you get to 10 pound an hour give me a call but for us 10 pound an hour isn't economic. You can't pay them we can't pay them that no We can't pay them that, no. It doesn't work. We're not a charity. It's a business. Farming is not darling buds of May. It's factory farming, really. It's like a machine. So when I turn my machine on, which is my picking machine, it needs to be as efficient as the production side. I need everything to work really well. I need to hit kilo prices. I need to get yield. Otherwise it doesn't work. Tim says a good picker can earn more than £1,000 a week. With a lower cost of living back home in Ukraine, for example, the money earned here in six months means they don't have to work for the rest of the year. We're now under one of these massive polytunnels, which are about two, three hundred meters long, and there's thousands and thousands of strawberry plants at shoulder height and a bunch of women picking. I think about five of them around here you can hear the noise possibly. Actually they're not picking fruit, they're tearing the leaves off, thinning out the plant to make it easier to see the fruit and also to get air into it. And one of those pickers is 24-year-old Julia. How long have you been here this season? For six months. So when will you go back to Ukraine? 22 or five for in December. Christmas Day. You're going back on Christmas Day. I hope you have nice presents when you get back. Why have you come here? Sally is going to translate? I'll try to translate. Russia is not my, but I'm Bulgarian, but I can translate. So basically they want you to come and see London and they want you to earn some money. Do you feel that the money is good? Yeah. Yes, because you're earning what we would call minimum wage. Is that that still good for you? Yes. Yes. Because in Ukraine, it's very much, I wanted to come to I like traveling so and she's saying back in Ukraine, the earnings are very, very small. So that's why here if you work on a minimum wage, you can learn more. Work and travel. Work and travel. So does that basically mean that for every pound you earn in the UK it's worth more back in Ukraine? Yes, basically in one week I can under hold my wage for the month. So one week in the UK is worth a month's work in Ukraine. It's pickers like Julia who keep the supermarket shelves full of berries and there are some other important workers Tim has to pay for. We buy predatory insects to eat other insects. So we invest two, 300,000 a year buying predatory insects. Oh look, Sally's showing us a flower. Oh, look, what's that? Little black spot. This costs one and a half pence. That little black spot is an insect. That's one of your good insects. That's an ores. It's a good one. It's called oreus. It will eat another insect which is bad called thrips. They are insects that we employ. They don't need caravans. They're happy to take food as their payment. Perched on electricity lines looking down on us are some starlings. They may look innocent, but they're not. This is your stallings? And oh... Sally's just brought a big strawberry, but it's been half chewed. Yeah. Pecked, maybe. Yeah, pecked by starlings. Those naughty birds. You could have hundreds in here all walking around pecking at fruit. It's like a battlefield, isn't it? It is, it is it. All these enemies coming in. Yes, yeah. Despite his early concerns, this season's gone well for Tim. He's got his workers, fruit yields have been good, and berries have been popular with the customers. But there could be a problem on the horizon. And the government would like us to take over the employment of the furloughed, unemployed people made redundant. Does that worry you? Yeah, that greatly worries us. Firstly, there's not the people. If you take Maidstone, the area around Maidstone, there's four or five farms like us. So we all need nigh on 10,000 people to work on our farms there's not 10,000 unemployed people in kent i don't they're all going to have to come from all over the country and that's just made stone but then if you go to canterbury there's they probably want another 10,000 secondly we would have to do a lot of subsidization of wages picking rates would not be achieved as we need to then we would have to do a lot of subsidisation of wages. Picking rates would not be achieved as we need to. Then we would have to start putting prices up. Maybe people won't want to pay five quid for punny disturbers. Tim depends on seasonal workers from abroad. But government restrictions on immigration, particularly from the EU after Brexit, could snarl up his well-old machine. So the government has its hands now on the tap of how many people can come into the country. And I don't feel that the government, the Home Office, really understand the responsibility they've handed themselves. I don't now have trust that the government will be able to provide me with the labour that I need when I need it. They don't understand. The politicians do not understand about seasonal labour. And we can't be expected to invest huge amounts of money into crops which we do not know will ever get harvested. My producer, Phoebe and I have been allowed to pick gorgeous looking strawberry. which we do not know will ever get harvested. My producer Phoebe and I have been allowed to pick gorgeous looking strawberry. Lovely shape, very symmetrical. That is a perfect shape. Class one all the way now. Mmm, superbly sweet as well. What shall we do with a drunken sailor? What shall we do with a drunken sailor? What shall we do with a drunken sailor? What shall we do with a drunken sailor? What should we do with a drunken sailor? On the way back home, there was another revitalising stop to make. On an industrial estate in East Peckham, in Kent near Tumbridge. Walk through this door and the first thing that really hits you is the smell, yeast because they're brewing and I can see these massive silver-coloured tanks which is where all the beer is made. Now we're brewing something like about half a million pints a year which sounds a lot to us but it's probably what Carlsberg brew in a day or an hour even I don't know but we supply pubs, clubs, restaurants throughout Kent, East Sussex and South East London. Tumbridge brewery owned by Paul Bernasian and Nick Tate, provides beer for my local, the Long Pond. But when lockdown happened, the pubs shut. We had over 400 barrels in our store room. Full of beer. Full of beer, which we thought we were going to pour down the drain. Then publicans like Michael came to the rescue, demanding their 5-liter mini-barrels. We used to supply him, I don't know, with something like about 20 odd a week during normal times, and then suddenly it exploded. He was basically saying, I'll take as many as you've got. I think there were even a couple of occasions when we were up there with 80, 90 or 100. Then he was back the following week saying, I need more. Paul and Nick too were inspired to do takeaways and deliveries, and they began bottling their beer. So this famous storeroom is just here next door. Just behind us, yes. Just go in. Ooh. And it's much, much cooler here and we're totally surrounded by these massive stainless steel barrels. Cool furkins. They hold 72 pints in each one. We're in a temperature controlled area. It's been 12 and 15 degrees, which just keeps the beer at the right temperature. We hold about 400 barrels in here which we had at lockdown. A lot of pints? A lot of pints. You thought you might have to throw it all away? We thought we would have to throw it away. We didn't. We rack them up here and we decant them into two litre milk bottles. Yeah, milk bottles. Plastic. They don't look very attractive, but they serve a very good purpose. And people have much appreciated this fresh beer, as they call it. And a lot of people were in the very early days. It was almost like everyone was on holiday. We were getting in undated with orders. Clearly, just people just sitting in their back garden, probably drinking beer from lunchtime till midnight. So all in all, garden, probably drinking beer from lunchtime till midnight. So all in all, okay lockdown was worrying at the beginning, but it's been a fairly successful time for you. It's been challenging, but we've adapted and I think we're probably a stronger team and our business structure is now different, which can only be better for us long term and we're hopefully going to expand in a near future some of the pubs paul and nick supply have closed for good but the thirsty people of kent have meant sales are up on this time last year. I played a small part in that. If a lockdown is reimposed, Tumbridge Brewery at least will be ready to satisfy eager customers, like those back in South East London waiting outside the long pond. Michael, people at the door. It's 5 o'clock, it's the big moment. There we are, the door's open. There we are, the door's open. Hello, sir. Right on time. Yep, sir, look. I'm going to wait here. I've got to the tables. I know you have. Hello Tony. All right, great. You're in the pool and over there. First two customers in about five and half, almost six months. Yeah, we've been waiting outside for six months. Yeah. They're coming in six miles. They're coming in thick and fast, thirsty for their beer. No, I will. It's just fabulous to be back. It's the real thing and it's to survive and just being somewhere like this, which is, you know, it's so local. It's a fabulous business. A great assets of the community, really. It's just good to think that. I think back in the sea, back in a wooden chair, back in the gubernars, seeing people, the atmosphere, it's, yeah. So Michael, it's been open for a little while, short while. How's it going, do you think? Oh, yeah, it's good. I mean, we've got other people, we will be full up within the next half an hour, table-wise, anyway, yeah. Not full capacity, but every table will be taken. They're all booked out now. Oh, that's good. It's a good cost of stuff. This is a good crowd for a half-past five on a normal under, yeah. Yeah, it is. And you're giving them personal service as well. Absolutely, yeah. Which I always used to joke about here, when people sitting in that table, we've got that table just to run the bar and I've got a pint of front and I used to stand there and just said come up the bar and we don't do table service and ironically John that's all we do now well I think it's time for a pint and that's it from in business so first all, good luck to Michael and let's raise a glass to those companies that have made it thus far and obviously genuine commiserations to those who haven't made it. Cheers everyone. Cheers. in the drum can you sing in the morning. In business was presented by me, John Murphy, and my producer was Phoebe Keene. The editor of the series is Penny Murphy.
