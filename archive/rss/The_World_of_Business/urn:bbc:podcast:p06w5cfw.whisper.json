This podcast is supported by advertising outside the UK. Welcome to the World of Business podcast. I'm Matthew Gweaver, and in this week's download edition of In Business, I'm asking, what's next for Britain's rail industry? It's been yet another turbulent and challenging year on our railways. But I'm starting the programme in Rome. So here comes train 9915 from Rome to Naples. Sleak, dark red bullet train. I've come to Italy to experience their high-speed trains, not just for the thrill of a dash to Naples and back, but to get a closer look at how rail competition is operating here, and to see whether there's anything we in Britain could learn from the Italians about running our railways. When I've seen the first time the red train, for me was a big emotion emotion because to be the owner of a train company is something important and it's not a small model was a real train. Luca Coderre di Montezemolo is chairman and co-founder of Italo a private train company which is giving Italy's state-owned rail conglomerate a run for its money on the same high-speed tracks. Customers now have a choice. Mr. Montezemolo is best known, however, for once being the boss of that other maker of red transportation devices, Ferrari, but allegiances can change. Thinking of the future of my country, I thought that train would be the future. I'm looking out to the west and we've just passed Montecino. It's still amazingly green despite the fact that it's so late in the year. It's a bright beautiful sunny day, 20 degrees centigrade and I'm on the train going from Rome to Naples. What's special about this train is that, well for a and I'm on the train going from Rome to Naples. What's special about this train is that, well for a start it's travelling at 300 kilometres an hour which is about as far as a train can go and it's a privately operated service which is in direct competition with the state operated train Italian. This is something that happens very rarely in the UK. The high-speed train has been discovered in Italy. Because if now you and me, we want to go to have a nice afternoon in Florence, now we go from here, from this office, in 15 minutes we are on the train, and in one hour we are in the center of Florence, or in 50 minutes we are in the centre of Naples. So it's like a subway. Italy's high-speed rail service isn't just an incredibly fast way of travelling. It's also seen as one of the best examples of rail competition in Europe, as the two companies go head to head on exactly the same routes. For decades, trains within Europe have been state-controlled, but gradually competition is being introduced as EU rules force liberalisation on the railways. Here in the UK though, our rail sector was privatised more than two decades ago, but today it's hard to find many rail passengers with a good word to say about our trains, with strikes, cancellations and delays, regular cause for misery. Now, Transport Secretary Chris Grayling has launched yet another review of the industry. And in this programme, I'm asking, what next for our railways? But first, let's recap. The process of privatising British rail began in 1994. It was split into three sections, track, rolling stock or trains, and train operating companies. The train companies bid to run franchises, paying the government to operate in different regions of the country. Less busy routes actually receive state subsidies, but all have to comply with strict terms set out by the Department for Transport, usually for a period of between seven and ten years. Unlike the Italian high speed example, they are not in full-on competition with each other. The track and infrastructure was absorbed into rail track, a private company, listed on the stock market. But it had a terrible safety record and after fatal crashes on the network, it was effectively re-nationalized and in 2002, state-owned network rail took over. It receives grants from the government $4.2 billion in the last financial year. And lastly, private rolling stock companies own the trains which they lease to the train operating firms. That was a very courageous decision that the government made. The problem is it didn't go far enough. And when you don't go far enough with privatization, what you end up with is a system of privatized monopolies. That's Dave Ashton, CEO of Loco 2, an online booking company for train and bus travel in the UK and Europe. He's talking about the train companies which are operating the different franchises. It is, in fact, in general, the worst of both worlds. Because what happens is you have privatized companies who are there for profit, but they have no competition. That's a terrible way to run a business. My own opinion is that the rail infrastructure should remain as it is, but that we should award contracts to multiple players on the various sets of infrastructure because it's that very competition that will drive down costs and improve innovation. So that's one end of the spectrum. Dave Ashton would like privatise rail to be more liberalised like in Italy. And then, at the other end of the rainbow, what we've seen in the last 25 years is that privatisation has really failed. It's produced a railway that's inefficient and fragmented with astronomical fares and essentially it's just not working for the country. And what about all of those profits that could have been reinvested for the benefit of passengers everywhere but instead just went to a handful of shareholders? This is Kat Hobbs, director of We Own It, a campaign group calling for the renationalisation of the rail industry and other utilities. In May, the franchise on the East Coast line was taken back under government control, providing ample evidence, she argues, that rail isn't working in private hands. We originally had rail track, there were fatal accidents that was brought into public ownership under Network Rail. The East Coast line has failed in private hands repeatedly and it's had to be brought into public ownership. But the rest of the rail franchises are run by private operators who return a profit to their shareholders. And I think really what we also have is actually a lot of government's interference in the railway because the government is always having to step in and try and sort out the mess that they've created. Kat Hobbs thinks if trains were re-nationalised, as Labour promises it will do if it gets into power, there'd be far less wrangling all round. So actually, I think if we had a publicly owned integrated network, we would have a lot more professional freedom for that publicly owned organisation to make sure that the railway was serving the public and serving passengers without, you know, never-ending politics and the blame game that Chris Grayling is constantly enmeshed in. I think it's a knee-jerk response, which I entirely understand if your service isn't working, if you're suffering frequent delays and frequent disruptions, I completely understand why you would want to say, well, if this is what privatisation is, give me the alternative. Steve Norris, a former Conservative Transport Minister, was in office throughout the process of rail privatisation. But actually, I don't think that is the case here. I don't think the alternative is a return to nationalisation. If by that you mean, a system which the Department for Transport would once again manage, you understand that as a minister in the department and somebody who's really got transport, you know, running through his veins, I just think the worst thing in the world is to see an operating railway run by government. I just don't think it works. You were an enthusiastic advocate of privatisation. Now, why was that? What was the state you found the railways in when you became the junior transport minister? Well, quite frankly, the state is very well known to anybody who was a regular user, a British rail. We had under-invested in the railway since the Second War. And frankly, by the time we got to the early 90s, it was becoming just embarrassingly evident that something needed to change. Right then, that was almost 25 years ago, but many of today's travelling public aren't exactly happy with what we've got now. I know there was a queue. I know that. And we've just happened. It just happened. I've been here in and now because I can't move. So I'm just deciding whether to abandon it and catch a bus. We'll go home, work from home. I got here about half an hour ago and he's saying there's no trains on the track. There's nothing. I've just been told that there's not any more trains going to Guildford, so it's unlikely I'll be able to make it into work today. It's just ridiculous. We pay so much as well for like train tickets. This was last month, chaos on a Monday morning after weekend engineering work had overrun on the track used by southwestern trains. Graham Hampshire has spent 40 years in the rail industry and he's now an independent consultant. One of the problems that we have at the moment as an industry is that our travelling public don't trust us. They don't trust us because they see an opaque system that they find very, very difficult to understand. In some ways they're looking for the one person to blame and looking for, if you like, the fat controller and that one person at the moment within the way the industry is structured is not identifiable. And I think we need as an industry to make it much clearer to our travelling public who's in charge and where their money is going. But in spite of that lack of trust and public opinion which is swaying towards renationalisation, Graham Hampshire, a railway man through and through, says that privatisation has been a success for customers, with passenger numbers doubling since the 90s. However, he studied the train company's profits and says they're hardly laughing all the way to the bank. My argument would be that the private sector has actually delivered for the UK travelling public. We have one of the fastest growing railways in Europe. We also have one of the safest railways in Europe and we're in the upper quartile in terms of passenger satisfaction. Now that's not happened overnight and it's not happened without a lot of effort. Certainly now with the private sector operators, their turnover in terms of revenue is about £10 billion last year, and on that £10 billion, they made £40 million profit. So for every £10 of ticket revenue, the private sector got £4, and they handed back to government in terms of premium £50. It doesn't sound like a great game to be in if you're in the private sector in railways. I was thinking about that on my way here. I'm going to have to answer, well, who's the mug here? And I think the private sector operators now are starting to question whether this is a business in which they want to invest. And we've seen bid lists for rail franchising is getting smaller over the last few years. So it's losing its attraction for the private sector? Certainly in terms of the way that it's set up at the moment. So should the way the government divides up the country into individual rail franchises be fundamentally changed? Former transport Minister Steve Norris thinks the franchises are too prescriptive and too limited because of the relatively short length of the contracts offered. The answer is actually incremental change. It is about rationalising in a serious way that hasn't happened yet the number of franchises that currently exist. I prefer a concession model where effectively I am given the right to operate the service from here on in. Because, you know, it's only with a concession model, for example, that a train operator has a genuine incentive to invest substantially in infrastructure. He says if train companies fail to run the services competently, then a new commercial operator should be found. So let's get back to my high-speed train ride in Italy and find out what direct competition, private operator versus state train company, on exactly the same route, has meant for passengers. Luca Coderro di Montezemolo in Rome. The biggest achievement is, first of all, to be successful. 17 million passengers today this year is really a big, big numbers. And we know that in the next year we will do more than 20. Really, we made attention to every single detail. And this was my job in Ferrari, because Ferrari is made by small details, because if you want to buy it, Ferrari, we want to have everything perfect. He's now feeling big amore for his private train company, so desirable it's recently been sold to the American giant global infrastructure partners. He's remaining as chairman, though, and proudly outlines what Italy has achieved so far. To be very useful to our country, because Italy again has been the first to do it with success, to improve the customer satisfaction of the travellers, to have a far big competition in prices, so the prices again, since we arrived, decrease of 40% the average, that is a lot. That's 40% low fares across the board on the high-speed services, Italy and the state-owned Trenitalia. But what I want to know is whether this model could be transplanted to the UK. Ladies job, nurse is 1127, Grand Central Service to Sondland. Service will call. It's a Friday just before lunchtime and the service is absolutely heaving. People are opening their bottles of wine, white and red, going ready to pay monopolyopoly which is inset into the tables or chess. I'm on my way to meet Richard McLean who's managing director of Grand Central Trains. The interesting thing about this train company is that in a very small way it's trying to do what itilo has done on Italy's high speed lines. It's what's known as an open access operator which exists outside the tightly government-monitored franchise system and on one stretch, York to London and back, operates in direct competition with LNER. That's the East Coast Service, which was a private franchise, until Stagecoach and Virgin handed it back to the Department for Transport in May when it realised it couldn't fulfil its contract and pay what it had promised the government. Grand Central operates with just 10 well-used second-hand trains and 18 services a day. Richard McLean says he loves the freedom he has. We can think and plan long term. We don't have a time-bound contract with government to deliver a specific set of outputs and no more and no less. We're able to take long-term investment decisions. What do you offer then that LNER doesn't? Why should people be going with you back down to London now, as we will be in an hour's time. So first of all, we provide a service to communities and locations that other operators have chosen not to do. We go to Sunderland and Hartlepool and Eaglescliffe and others have chosen not to do that. If you're at York, you've got an open choice. You can travel with us if our train is convenient and you like the price that we have available. What our passengers tell us through the National Rail Passenger Survey each year is that our passengers like the way our staff look after them. What we can see is that fair levels overall at York have not risen as fast as fair levels at other stations that are comparable where passengers aren't given choice of operator. But you see that being quite polarised. So actually the best value fares are only available in the parts of the day where the choice is available. So you still have very high prices in the peak hours where there's only one operator allowed to operate currently. So you reckon there is appetite for more direct competition then? There'd be more people wanting to do what you're doing at the moment, given the choice. The fact that the current model cannot, it would appear, address the challenges we have now. Looking at a model that is working in this country, in a small way, is working in other countries in a big way, in Sweden, in Austria, and in Italy and shortly in Spain, why wouldn't we look at that as an alternative? There are a few rare instances where direct competition does operate already in the UK. Hull Trains is another small company like Grand Central and runs trains from Hull to London. Occasionally franchises overlap on sections of their routes but the majority of customers in the UK do not have a choice. How many more companies like yours do you think there might be? I believe that it is perfectly viable and in fact desirable that the intercity network should be operated on a fully commercial basis by multiple operators on each route, providing passengers with direct choice on all the journeys that they want to make. The rail regulator in the UK is now trying to encourage more open access operators, but is competition like this practical for us? The obligation on the franchise holders is to stop occasionally. I mean, you can make a lot of money running direct, you know, door-to-door services between major cities, because that's what a high proportion of passengers will actually want. Some cold water lobbed by former transport minister Steve Norris, who says this sort of competition would not serve all communities. It's odd to come from a Tory like me to say that there are times when competition isn't actually of itself the answer. This is one of them. But Luca Coderro di Montezemolo, co-founder of Italy, doesn't see stopping as a problem for competition in the UK. If you want to go to Milan, we have during the day many trains that they go from Rome to Milan no stop, and from Milan, Rome, no stop. But you can go to Milan, even with stops, Florence, Bologna, Reggio Emilia and Milan. So you can have a double possibility, possibility of straight from Bristol to London, no stop, for instance. Or train that are obliged to stop, of course. It's questioned that the high speed that they don't stop, they pay more for the trucks. Another company that stops in every single station, even small villages, maybe they can pay less, and the business model are different. That's the view from Luca Coderro di Montezemolo in Rome. My name is Ernesto Sicilia. Another Italian train boss, they get everywhere, but this one isn't in Italy. Ernesto Sicilia is managing director of Trenitalia UK, which is owned by the Italian state. He runs the C-to-C London to Essex commuter line franchise. Confused? Well, about two-thirds of the UK's rail franchises are owned or part-owned by foreign state rail operators. Ernesto Chichelia is also on the board of the Rail Delivery Group, which represents the train operating companies and network rail. So first of all, why rail fare is going up again, this time by an average of 3.1% in a few days' time. Nobody likes to pay more for the same services. The problem is that we have the same increase in our costs, because our cost is more or less 70 70% fixed cost linked to contract. For example, what we pay for the using of the network increased at the same level of the tariff for the customer. How the market is built, there is no alternative that increase on the fare. The alternative would be that the wider taxpayer paid more. How does our system in the UK compare with Italy in terms of the degree to which the state and taxpayers support the system? That is a completely different approach because in Italy we have two different markets. The first is high speed lines with competition without any support from the state. The other kind of services, some long old services between south and north, and all the regional contract with the regional traffic, with the single region, is a grant's contract. And so for every ticket that we sell in Italy, two third is paid by the state, one third is paid by the passengers. This is a choice. In UK, the government decided that the passengers had to pay. We pay proportionately more here. Absolutely. It seems to me that we've got a system here which, with very few exceptions, no one's happy with. Maybe this is not a very brilliant moment for the UK real market. Well, that's an understatement. Everyone is busy blaming each other for delays over running engineering work, timetabling disasters, strikes, you name it. But what I keep hearing is that our rail system, one of the most intensively used anywhere in Europe, has become hugely fragmented and complex since privatisation, and that's increasingly being seen as a problem. So would Ernesto Shishilia recommend re-nationalisation? He is, after all, an Italian civil servant working for a huge state-owned rail conglomerate. It's different because we are nationalised from the very beginning, and so we build our history, we build our structure and our competence on this basis. In the UK, after 20 years or more of privatization, fragmentation of the market, it's very complicated to come back. You don't think it could be done? It could be done, but it's very expensive. It's very complicated. And there is no certainty that it could be better for the passenger. So what would Ernesto Sicilia do with the UK's rail system? His main complaint is that it has too many component parts. This, he says, makes it hard when, for example, a delay is caused by network rails engineering work, as they're invisible to the customer. It's very difficult to explain on the customer that you are arriving in delay, but it's not my fault because there is some people that is hidden. Behind me, I believe that a strong partnership between infrastructure manager and infrastructure people and trainer breeding companies could be very useful. The railway industry is a typical industry that is based on integration of different part of the industry. And if the integration doesn't fit well, it's a mess. What you're saying is that if you were in charge not just of your rolling stock and selling the tickets, but also the track and the overhead power lines in your bit, you could do a better job. Yeah, absolutely. The fragmentation of the competencies is too strong, in my opinion. Lillian Greenwood is the Labour Chair of the House of Commons Transport Select Committee, which scrutinises the operations and responsibilities of the Department for Transport. As we've heard already, we've got another rail review. This one is being chaired by Keith Williams, the former Chief Executive of British Airways and deputy chairman of John Lewis. We have been reviewed to pieces. I've lost track of the number of reviews we've had, even in the sort of eight years that I've been in Parliament. But I think there's probably a growing consensus in the last year or two that the current system isn't working, that it is broken and therefore the new rail review under Williams is timely. But I think it does need to be prepared to look at all options if it's going to be successful and to command trust and confidence. But do you think they're going to come up with something bold then this time? That's different. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know whether there's really that willingness to think about all the possible options and come up with some radical suggestions. But you must have your own ideas. I mean you're one of the experts on this, aren't you? Is there a trick that we've been missing that we should be trying to improve things? Well I think one of the things that we heard in our inquiry into the failure of the intercity East Coast franchise was that the Secretary of State wants to have a closer integration between the operator of the trains and the operator of the infrastructure, which is quite a strange thing to say in a way because the whole thing that happened at privatisation was separating those two things and now it's saying how can we bring those two things back together now i think a lot of people would say that integration that seems sensible but making it work is quite difficult because there have been a number of attempts to try to bring the two things back together but in the current system and they've not really been effective so what would lillian Green would do? Her party labour wants renationalisation, but she says the cross-party committee which she chairs hasn't considered whether or not rail should become fully state-owned. She points to regional transport services, not overseen by the Department for Transport, but run locally as an option to develop further. I think devolution has been a really successful model. It's worked really well for Transport for London. It's worked really well for Mersey Rail, and there's obviously quite an appetite for it. And the second is, do we need to have a single model? Is there room for trying different things and seeing what works in different places? What about the potential for more employee involvement? What about the potential for cooperative models? I'm not saying that there's necessarily a one size fits all. Maybe there's room for trying different things, and devolution would allow the possibility of that happening. We asked the Department for Transport for an interview with Chris Grayling, the Transport Secretary, but our request was declined. They said in a statement that... Since privatisation, the UK's railways have gone through a period of incredible growth, with passenger journeys more than doubling. But the railway industry has not kept pace with this huge customer demand. They say the rail review will result in a white paper next autumn and reform in 2020. Our rail system is the oldest in the world and I've rarely come across an industry sector as complex and fragmented. One thing's for sure, with few exceptions stakeholders from passengers to government seem disgruntled. Solutions are many and varied, with renationalisation at one end and far greater liberalisation at the other. The Rail Review's job is to find an answer that tries, if possible, to make everyone happier. On the Rails was produced by Caroline Bailey, and the editor is Penny Murphy."}
