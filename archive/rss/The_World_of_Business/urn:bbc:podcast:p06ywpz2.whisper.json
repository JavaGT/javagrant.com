You're listening to Global Business on the BBC World Service with me, Karen Allen. Celestial stirrings from a church packed with worshippers. It's a baking hot Sunday morning, and the whitewashed walls give a sense of cool to this sacred space. But listen carefully to the choir in their white, Anglican robes, and you might just pick up that the language they're singing in is Korean. The congregation are reading off iPads rather than hymn sheets. As the pastor leads them in prayer, his words are displayed on a huge high-definition TV screen above his head, Korean made naturally. The service over, children play outside while their parents and grandparents mingle and catch up on the weekly happenings. People tell me this is a lot more than simply a place of worship. Our church promises, this one we are using like a community center. When we built our church, some of our Korean people living at the Pretoria, most of the people, Johannesburg. Yes, you heard that right. Despite seeming like a regular church that you'd come across in South Korea, we're actually more than 12,000 kilometers away on the edge of Johannesburg, South Africa's commercial capital. Joseph Huang, an elderly gentleman, gently takes me by the arm as he guides me around the beautiful lawns outside the church. As we stroll, he offers some insight into the 4,000 strong Korean community who call South Africa home. Most of the people, big companies, they are working, or some of them is private business. You're also a businessman as well as being a church elder. Tell me about your business. My business is set on accessories. Some of the items we import from Korea and we are distributing South Africa. Mr. Huang's decision more than a decade ago to establish a business selling cell phone accessories was a smart move. Samsung, a massive Korean corporation, now sells more phones in South Africa than its Chinese and American rivals. Mr. Wang's business has given him reach right across the continent as he straddles the world between big international firms, offering the latest in high-tech consumer goods, and small-scale Korean businesses. Culturally, Mr Huang is every bit of Korean. But after more than 20 years living in South Africa, he couldn't imagine being anywhere else. Will you always stay in South Africa, do you think? Or will you return to Korea? I want to die here. This is a story about Koreans setting up homes and businesses here in South Africa, a place which has become my home for the past eight years. It's a story about how the Koreans, often mistaken for Chinese, a seizing control of some of the key markets in a continent which is often grandly described as the final frontier. I'm going to talk to them about some of the challenges they face here in South Africa as they seek to deliver an ambition to continue growing. Although Korea is dwarfed by China when it comes to level of foreign direct investment, Korea invests millions rather than the billions of its Asian neighbour, you have to remember that its private capital which is being pumped in, not ventures underwritten by the big state banks. What's more when you measure what impact Korean companies are having in South Africa, Forbes magazine ranks the Koreans fifth when it comes to sales, profits and market value. Put simply, that suggests that Korea's footprint might be relatively small, but it packs a good punch and is hungry to grow. But it wasn't always like that. Korea didn't become an economic powerhouse overnight. Korea is a country, this is the poster boy for industrialization, development and economic success, considering where the country had come from a mere generation previously. Martin Davies is the managing director of emerging markets and Africa at the global auditing firm, Deloitte. I arrived before the financial crisis, the Asian financial crisis, and I left shortly after when Korea was in deep crisis. Korea had been used to growth rates of 10%, but when the financial crisis hit in 1998, it had to be rescued with a $58 billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund. Yet it managed to turn its financial woes around very quickly. What was a secret to its success? It's a very simple, focus, dedication, hard work and entirely pragmatic pro-business policies. Exports are what powers the South Korean economy. Koreans have some huge world-renowned brands here now, LG and Samsung in the electronics market, and Kia and Hyundai in automotive. The infrastructure in South Africa is good, certainly when you compare it to other African countries. And it's a key consideration for bigger corporations when they decide where to set up their main hub on the continent. Hi, Karen Allen, BBC. Hi, Corinne Cooper. Same name, great name. This is extraordinary. We're standing next to the future of home appliances. What have we got here? This looks like a, any ordinary fridge, but it's not, is it? No, definitely not. We call it the knock-knock fridge. You're knocking on the panel and all of a sudden it's lit up and you can see the contents of your fridge. Yes. What we've done with our technology is given the consumers the chance for not cold air escaping and also being energy efficient that you can see through the glass what products you have or what you're running out of. And it's not just a gimmick. When we talk about bigger Korean corporations, one of the world's leading electronic companies springs to mind, LG. Marketed under the extremely catchy slogan, Life's Good, LG is manufacturing not only funky fridges like the one Karen just demonstrated, but also televisions, washing machines, and increasingly mobile phones. I've come to LG's factory in Germestan on the outskirts of Johannesburg just south from the airport. LG chose to make this place their African hub 21 years ago at a time of huge financial turmoil back in Korea. It was risky, but South Africa was a fledgling democracy. The apartheid era was over and the air was filled with hope and promise, and Korean firms sensed an opportunity. There are many factors we have to consider. First one is we have to see the potential. Chi Yun Kim is the managing director of LG South Africa. South Africa is well organized in terms of infrastructure. And also we have to consider kind of the logistics also when we produce here, easy to export to other countries. The third thing is the market demand is South Africa, has more than 55 million population, and many of people's LSM, 7 to 10, which can't afford to buy premium product. Just to translate the jargon, LSM, which you've just heard Mr. Kemp mention, is the living standards measure, which runs from one, the poorest, to 10, the wealthiest. There are a lot of people who fall into the 7 to 10 bracket here. Put simply, that means there's a burgeoning black middle class in South Africa that can potentially afford the top end products. South Africa, we are most selling country to sell 86-inch TV in Africa and Middle East countries. Even there are very rich countries like Dubai, Kuwait, Qatar. There are many rich people that are there. But we are selling more, they're kind of big-sized TVs. And those enormous 86-inch TVs are assembled in this factory. Lefadez Mabe, who is line control manager, talked me through the process. This is the start of the line, assembly line. Currently now we are assembling a OLED-77 model. It's a massive TV screen. So it's one of our signature models. Let's have a look at what's happening here. There's a lady holding what looks like an electric screwdriver. Yeah, that's an electric screwdriver. In this process, there's a lady here putting their Wi-Fi control, as well as the Matterport and some brackets. About a dozen women in blue overalls hover over a slow-moving conveyor belt. It looks like intricate work. I'm struck by just how quiet this production line is. Everyone here has a clearly defined task. Currently our standard when we fix it's about 2.7 seconds per screw but her time currently now it's about 1.9 seconds. That incredible? They measured down to the final team. Yeah so she's well experienced. She's. That incredible? You measured down to the final team. Yeah. So she's well experienced. She's been here for around six years now. So she's one of the fastest members to fix it. We've got these screens up in the center of the factory with various numbers on that. What are those describing? So on the screen we'll have the current target and the day output. We're looking at about 736 units that we are going to assemble today. We are 95.7 percent, so which we need about 4 percent to finish our production. What happens if you don't reach the target in the day? Do you have to work overtime to reach that target? Yes, yes, yes. We have to meet that target because it says the requirement. So if we don't reach the target, sales won't be able to sell the stock. Today's a good day and there's no danger that the target won't be met. But managing director Mr. Kim says there is work to be done. Complacency is not in the Korean national character. Koreans work really hard. Competition is very serious among Koreans. From middle school, we had to really hard. Competition is very serious among Koreans. From middle school, we had to work hard, study hard. But here in South Africa, everything is big and generals. They enjoy their life, life and balance. But sometimes they are not so serious. They are not so hard for their task. So the thing is how to harmonize these two cultures. If you stay in the office till 9 o'clock at night, do your staff have to stay at 9 o'clock at night as well? No, of course not. But in Korea, in old days, you would have to, it would be expected that you would stay with your boss. Yes, yes, yes. When the boss is in office, the subordinates have to stay till the boss is... If you go for an after-work drink, do they have to go and drink sojournal? So is that changing as well? I was no Korean culture very well. Have you been there? I was there for a while, yes. It may be an old-fashioned stereotype, but Korean business culture has its own set of mores and protocols. Break them, even unwittingly, and it could make a difference between clinching the deal or getting that prize promotion or not. But Mr Kim concedes that it's not just his staff that determine the success of the company in its South African home. What could the government do to make it more attractive for companies such as LG to expand here? So I'd like to request to waive the federal tax, which imposed to TV is at this moment. These are luxury taxes that you get charged. Yes, luxury taxes, actually. For the middle-low customers in South Africa, they cannot afford to purchase the LG even small-sized entry TVs. LG, as a manufacturer, we try to reduce our cost, manufacturing costs, definitely. But if government can waive that tax, then I believe the South African people is much easier to purchase TV. Up until recently, not everyone would have wanted to buy from LG. Martin Davis from Deloitte again. 20 years ago, who would, with any sort of self-respect invite the neighbors around to your lounge to watch a lucky gold star TV? Nowadays, LG, I was literally shopping for TVs last weekend, and my choice is between LG and the Samsung. Rewind 10, 15 years ago, it used to be telephonkins and, you know, the European brands. Then it was the Japanese brands, the Sonys, the Panasonic, etc. Now it's almost entirely the Korean brands which dominate. And we see the same in automotive, exactly the same. How have they done it? Through drive, intense focus and early stage globalization, these were companies led by Deu back in the late 80s even. These companies were internationalizing, globalizing, despite at the time careers relatively low GDP per capita. So they were sort of, you know, real pioneers of going out from Asia globalisation. And they're the winners, undoubtedly. That dogged determination on the part of the Koreans has paid off and a pragmatic approach to business, which means that companies have not been afraid to adapt to suit to the tastes of local consumers is now reaping rewards. Samsung and LG are now some of the biggest names in the global electronics business. To really get under the skin of South Africa's Korean community, I've come back to the church, where in the gardens, parents sip tea in a small wooden hut as their children spend Saturday mornings in language classes. And it's not just Koreans who come. You just want to break from your classes? Yes. Are you learning Korean? Yeah, I want to go to Busan University because my friend went there and she said it was really good. And you'll South African? Yeah. Any Korean in the family or just have an interest in the place? I just have an interest. And how long have you been studying Korean for? Since the beginning of the year. And can you introduce yourself to me? Hello, I'm Anjali. And Angie, how old are you? I'm 16. You're 16 years old. My companions, smiling at my conversation with the teenager, reminisces about the time his young son studied here. It just brings lots of memory because this particular classroom conversation with the teenager reminisces about the time his young son studied here. It just brings lots of memory because this particular classroom here is where my son Liam used to come and study Korean. I mean, he was able to learn the Korean alphabet. That's Usak Zhong. His friends call him E.J. He's been based in South Africa since 2003. He's married to his South African. He first came as an economics graduate working in the steel industry. Now, though, he's turning his hand to business, running a small firm, importing novelty Korean stationery. What's it like being a Korean businessman in South Africa? It's very tough because here some of the things that we take for granted in other countries don't function as well as they should. For example, the post office, the delivery is almost non-existence. So you have to rely on a career service and you pay a hefty premium for that. So for business where cost really matters, it touch your business. A generous and gentle fellow, E.J. offers us a window on a world that very few of us here know much about. And as with most Koreans, a lunch or dinner invitation is never far away. And so it's a chance to continue the conversation. This is a fried mandu. Mandu is a Korean word for dumpling. As a businessman, I asked E.J. What the challenges working in South Africa are? Basically, the South African banking system, they are very advanced and well-run. However, labor is a thorny issue. In America, they say they hire easily and fire easily, whereas here, once you have employed permanent staff, it's very, very difficult to fire them. And also for established business electronics or technology-driven companies a lot of people say that it's very hard to find the talents that they want the interviewing process is a very lengthy is that an education system that we don't have the kind of technical education system that perhaps Korea has or other countries like Germany has well as you know you know, over the last few years, South Africa has had a huge brain drain issue. A lot of the engineers and the skilled people, they immigrated to Australia, New Zealand, Canada, you name it. So it's quite a tough task to find the right people with the right experience and talents. And also there's the policy of B, black economic empowerment. So if you run a business over certain size, by law you have to meet a quota. And it makes finding the right people even more difficult. Since 2013, when former President Jacob Zuma was elected for a second term, Korean investment has stalled. Confidence took a pounding with daily reports of corruption scandals under the Zuma administration. But with a new president at the helm, it seems many Koreans are hoping to recover lost ground, something I discussed with the Korean ambassador, Zhongde-Pak. One of the lessons Korea could possibly teach South Africa? You can have different culture, and politically it can be complicated and different. But when it comes to development, especially economic, the fundamental rules are all the same. And unless you realize that, you have difficulty. The ultimate answer lies in the fact that it is not matter of the means or resources. It's essentially how you manage them. And I think the most important thing is human capital and social capital instead of hardware or money. Because you can have various policies, you can get many, you know, fundings. But in the end, it's all done by human. Is this a polite and diplomatic way of saying education? Exactly. Education is at the core. I'm not talking about only academic education, about social education and moral education, including civic values. It's no secret that South Africa is battling with rampant corruption, and employers have to deal with all manner of regulations and tough labour laws due to powerful trade unions. Although the unions play a crucial role in bringing down the apartheid regime more than 20 years ago, many feel that they've looked after their own members at the expense of helping to create conditions for growth and badly needed jobs. Africa and many developed countries need to enlarge the pie. But here, too much emphasis in distribution. Is it too democratic? You know, where it can be. Of course, there are ways. When you talk about good governance, it's very crucial in green of democracy. That will only help. I think emphasis should be put more on performance. In short, the ambassador is among those who fear that precious resources are hemorrhaging out the economy through corruption and cronyism. Stop the bleeding, and it's a first step to recovery. So all things being equal, the better governance you have, the better chances and that you have successful development. So I encourage African countries to pursue good governance because there are so many leakages. Ambassador Park first came to this continent in 1973, the son of a diplomat, he spent time in Uganda and is passionate about Africa. More than that, he's determined to make brand career more distinctive in South Africa. When I go around, people will say hello to me and they will say, nihoma, you see? Which is, how are you, in Chinese or Mandarin? But I always, you know, correct them nicely. So I'm from South Korea and, you know, they're embarrassed. But it's important to inform people of uniqueness because it is also unfair when you just characterize all the African countries as Africans. Now they don't seem to really distinguish well between Koreans, Chinese or Japanese, but we have to be patient and we have to do our part. I thought I'd test Mr. Park's assertion out on the local people at Hershey's, Korean, Chinese or Japanese, but we have to be patient and we have to do our part. I thought I'd test Mr. Park's assertion out on the local people at Hershey's, one of Johannesburg's largest electronic stores. If I were to say to you, LG, which part of the world does that company come from? I'm not really sure, but I'm sure it's somewhere in Europe, the UK or some English-speaking country. Probably somewhere in the South Korea. I've no idea. Far East somewhere. Korea, Malaysia, Taiwan. Honestly, sounds Chinese but also sounds South African. Life is good. It's quite well branded for a South African market. So which one you're going to go for? South African. Life is good. It's quite well branded for a South African market. So which one you're going to go for? South African or Chinese. Proudly South African. That struck me as an interesting observation. Familiarity in design and style helps to sell products in foreign markets. And it reminded me of another Korean brand that's big in South Africa. Right, off we go. We're in the Kia Picanto. This is our entry-level car. It competes in the A segment. Gary Scott is the managing director of Kia Motors, South Africa. We run the distributorship, so we're a wholesaler. That means we do all the marketing, we do the logistics, we move the product to market. We set up the capability to support the cars in the network. So that's after sales, technical training, parts supply, all of that kind of thing. And then we develop a network of dealers. Basically, they're the face of Kia in the South African market. But it took a while to be trusted by the car bosses in Seoul and gain some level of autonomy. When I joined in 2002, I think I was joining something that was overtly Korean. You could feel it in the culture. Your interaction with your country manager was very much a Korean conversation. And what did that mean? Just characterize that for me. Very deadline driven, extremely hierarchical, high level of urgency, sales, sales, sales, and a pride and a confidence about we're coming and we're going to do this. As it's evolved, the culture has changed somewhat because they've had to have a global outlook. In order to conquer resistant markets, and Europe would be a good example, you need to recruit European thinking, you need to recruit European design language, and you need to involve local people who understand the mentality of the consumer in those markets. There's an incredible business maturity that's come through in that. So a noticeable difference from LG in terms of hierarchy. But not a single Kia vehicle is manufactured here. For instance, the sportage is made in Slovakia and then shipped across. Yet building cars is the biggest manufacturing sector in South Africa. The story of Korea is extraordinary in terms of it is manufacturing. And obviously here in South Africa, we've got very, very high rates of unemployment. President Ramaphosa wants to reduce those levels of unemployment by growing manufacturing here. What would it take for a company like here to start making some of the components here in South Africa? Could that ever happen? We are actually speaking with government on exactly that point. So when we talk about full scale assembly and manufacturing in this country, I think those conditions are honestly quite far away. Proximity to market is the biggest challenge, until the African continent becomes a scaled market for new cars. And there's legislative requirements, there's government appetites that need to change to make that a reality. I don't see us contributing to full-scale manufacturing. Not enough people buying cars to make that a reality. I don't see us contributing to field scale manufacturing. Not enough people buying cars to make it worthwhile. It's still cheaper to bring cars in from overseas. Returning to the church, I'm reminded of a generational shift. Just as younger South Africans are discovering the value of Korean business potential, Koreans coming to live in South Africa are attracted by some of the continent's traits. In the creche which adjoins the church, I find Ji Wan So, who says the Korean stress on excellence and fierce competition takes its toll on youngsters. A more South African laid-back approach is appealing. I don't want to expose them to have a hush long-time studying or something like that. I want them to enjoy the environment, enjoy the sports, swimming, and some artworks and the drawing without pressure. You need to be kids? Yeah, being able to be kids. And if they're necessary to study, I can say high school time, then they need to study. So you're not quite a tiger mom? No, no. Asian tigers or African lions, these metaphors are sometimes used to characterize a nation. But as the world gets smaller and Korean companies seek to increase their African footprint, South African leaders should perhaps be doing more to court and reassure career in businesses to ensure that they stay. That edition of Global Business was presented by Karen Allen and produced by Ben Carter. Neil Churchill mixed the program. I'm John Murphy and I was the editor. And if business stories are your thing, we're continuing to work on new programs, including on how the Germans are preparing for Brexit and on Uruguay's cannabis economy. They'll be coming up in the next few weeks."}
