Described as his greatest piece of chamber music it is probably the most frequently performed of his chamber works. Brahms was a demanding self-critic, and the quintet went through several iterations, beginning life as a string quintet, then transcribed into a sonata for two pianos before ending as a work for piano and string quartet. Here, the dual sides of his musical nature – dark, turbulent romanticism and rigorous classicism – were in their most fruitful conflict and balance,  the music covering a wide spectrum of moods: majesty, serenity, tension, foreboding, anger and joy.\n\nPiano Quintet in F minor, Op. 34 Johannes Brahms\n1. Allegro non troppo\n2. Andante, un poco adagio\n3. Scherzo: Allegro\n4.

Mōteatea refer to all forms of traditional waiata or songs. These waiata were composed to transmit, retain and celebrate the life, customs and history of Māori. \n\nIn the case we have the hand written manuscript of a waiata composed by Hinewairoro and collected by Riwai Te Ahu from Ngāti Hinerangi and Ngāti Awa. We can assume this waiata dates back to an earlier time. This waiata has been identified as, A song to incite remembrance in people’s hearts.  \n\nOn view for July 2023 in the Reading Room Level 2 Tāmaki Pātaka Kōrero | Central City Library or by request at any time.\n\nImage: Karakia, Waiata.

Now known as the Old Arts Block, it has become a landmark building for central Auckland. \n\nLippincott was an American architect who worked in New Zealand during the 1920s and 1930s. He designed other buildings for the university as well as the Farmers Tea Rooms, a six-storey extension to Smith and Caughey department store, and private residences.\n\nLippincott was inspired by the country he found himself living in, and incorporated ponga fronds, flax seedpods, kaka and kea, and Māori motifs into the Old Arts Block, and delightful, sculpted kauri snails in the Old Biology Building.\n\nHe returned to the United States in 1940 but his work can still be found around Auckland today.

Alongside Rod’s words, the performance includes a soundscape by Rod’s daughter Celeste Oram.\n\nRod draws on the ideas explored in his book Three Cities: Seeking Hope in the Anthropocene for this piece. In that book he looks at the fundamental changes required in politics, economics and technology in order to sustain the human population in its current habitat: planet Earth.\n\nRod Oram has over 40 years’ experience as an international business journalist. He has worked for various publications in Europe and North America, including the Financial Times of London. He is a frequent public speaker on business, economics, innovation, creativity and entrepreneurship.\n\nCeleste Oram is a composer whose work explores new media and strategies for composition and annotation.

The D minor piano trio starts the first movement in the tradition of late German Romanticism with a grand sonata form wielding impressive, sweeping        melodies underlied by tremulous, destabilising, syncopated accompaniment reminiscent of the           Mendelssohn D minor trio’s first movement. The second movement “Scherzo” is a whimsical concoction of good humour and delightful cheer presenting the light-hearted spirit of the dance. The third movement “Eegia” presents an unrelenting sombre mood with muted strings and tender themes to really emphasise the grieving character of music as this trio was dedicated to the memory of Karl Davydov, a renowned Russian cellist and Arensky’s friend. The Finale begins with an explosive theme but soon recalls motifs from the previous movements giving the piano trio a cyclic structure before insistently driving the work to a fantastical end.
