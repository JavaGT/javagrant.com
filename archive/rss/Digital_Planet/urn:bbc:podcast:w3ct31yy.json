In experiments, currently carried out in mice at the University of California San Diego, the tiny robots swam around the lungs and delivered antibiotics that killed the disease-causing bacteria.  The amount of antibiotics needed is a tiny fraction of the amount currently used to treat this infection intravenously.  The robots are made from algae cells (this allows them to move) covered in antibiotic-filled nanoparticles. These nanoparticles are made with tiny spheres that are coated with the cell membranes of neutrophils – a type of white blood cell that fights infection and inflammation -  making the microrobots more effective at fighting the lung infection.
