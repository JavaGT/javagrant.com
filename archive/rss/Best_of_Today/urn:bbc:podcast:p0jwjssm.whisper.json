BBC Sounds, music, radio podcasts. A decade ago, the writer, actor and comedian Miranda Hart was all over our TV screens. From her eponymous sitcom to her role in the primetime hit called The Midwife, she was fated at the award ceremonies. And then it stopped, and we haven't heard from her for some years. That's because she collapsed, became bedbound and was unable to work and unable to get a diagnosis for, as it turned out, most of her life. The good news of sorts is that she has finally had a diagnosis of Lyme's disease, which Miranda believes she contracted in her teens and was forced to live with the long after effects as it was never properly treated, and that she's feeling considerably better, well enough to have written a book called, I haven't been entirely honest with you, about what she has learned from living with chronic illness and hopes now she can help others. She also has some much happier news to share too of a more romantic nature. I'm Emma Barnett, and I've been speaking to Miranda Hart for the Today programme. First about the effect her condition has had on her ability to work. When it got to a crunch point and I really was unable to work and was basically bed-panned and house-band, my body was telling me I'm not physically right and eventually got the diagnosis of ultimately under the banner of ME. And we joined the dots with my symptomology in my history and realised that probably when I was about 14 or 15, I got a tick-borne illness in the form of Lyme disease. And that's when my symptoms started. And so I basically, you could call it long lime. So it was such a relief to finally be understood and not mis... I mean, being misunderstood and misjudged is one of the hardest things about these kind of conditions, for sure. There was a crunch point where you collapsed, you couldn't work anymore. I mean, being misunderstood and misjudged is one of the hardest things about these kind of conditions, for sure. There was a crunch point where you collapsed, you couldn't work anymore, but lots of your fans will be wondering where you've been. What was that moment? I think unless you've had fatigue, you don't understand what literally not getting up off the floor was. There'll be times when I'd look at a glass of water, I think I don't know how to pick that up. But yeah, when I lay there and I thought, I don't know what to do now. I think the hardest thing to learn is acceptance and surrendering to your situation. And I'd spent so many years because I have this adventurous, bold, excitable love of life and I had so many dreams and ideas and some of them came true which was extraordinary and I didn't want them to end and I didn't want to stop working that, excuse me, that was a mild teababat on the Radio 4. You'll welcome the nation. You're very welcome. You're welcome, Emma. Is that at first? We're in a hotel room, your hotel room, not just randomly together that we've booked. Well, that's the story you're telling. But we have a cough button in the studio if we'd been there, so we could have used it as a teaburp. No, but I think the nation needs the teaburp, actual sound. Where was I? Oh, yeah, acceptance. So it's, I've accepted that I've burped on National Radio. When you're bed-bound with something, you do have to live moment by moment. You're not distracted by anything. You're not distracted by busyness or mental energy or physical capacity or can't go on holiday. There's nothing you can do. So acceptance and then thinking, right, what is the next right action? I used to say to myself, what is the next loving right action in every moment? And that's what I'd say to someone who is bed-b-banned now. How can you make this moment slightly better for yourself? Your work has, over the years, when you look back at how you felt doing your work, against this backdrop of constantly getting viruses, constantly getting ill, being exhausted, like truly exhausted. Do you think you were able to enjoy your work? It's a strange one. Comedy is a career, is an odd one anyway, because you're working so hard to make other people laugh. So you're on this environment of laughter, you're hearing laughter, you're receiving laughter. And that's my sort of raise on dexter, really. The more fun and joy and play there is in life, the more vital and healthy, I think we are. And it's so important to me. So to hear those laughs and do that as a living was incredible. But yeah, I do think along the way, not necessarily just because of my job, but due to the viral load, due to the pressures of the work, and then becoming famous and having to navigate that while still, the whole thing, I think I did lose a bit of my own joy within that, which, paradoxically, through illness I have got back. I had to find opening my window and looking at a tree joyful. I had to, you know, it was a real humbling experience to be so restricted. And my thing is that I was very alone in it. So some people might have a family and that might be difficult to negotiate. Mine was that I was completely alone and there was a pandemic as well. So I found within it a joy and a meaning in life that I never thought possible. One of the most beautiful parts of what you've written is the way you declare that you don't want to be on your own anymore, that you want to be in love, you want to be loved, and you talk about navigating a lot of this on your own. But there is a love story that you are telling with your return, Miranda. Yeah. And sorry, as I'm looking at you, I'm very distracted by a ring on your hand, on your wedding finger. Can we talk, please? Yeah, well, I think the reason I put this little love story of mine in it was mainly because at the beginning in the book, yeah, I'm alone, I'm bedbound with a illness, I don't know what it is. beginning in the book, yeah, I'm alone, I'm bedbound with a illness, I don't know what it is. And what that sort of length of aloneness and waiting in the darkness and the confusing place is that it gives you the chance to long for what you want to do. And I realise I didn't want to be alone. We can obviously say that you're married now. And at the age of... At the age of 51. Congratulations. Yes, thanks. I really reckon. I mean, I know you're married now, but honestly, getting married in midlife, full injection of joy and fun and, you know, all my friends have been married 20, 30 years, and like, oh, husband. And I'm like, husband, he's great. It's the best. It's a bit of an odd question in light of what you said because sometimes you'll still be living moment to moment. But would you say you're well now? Emotionally, and I feel very well. And I feel, which is important for me to say, because obviously I've been labelled as the anxious one. Physically, I think there's just a little way to go to get my full energy back. Getting back to work has been a really exciting next step, but a bit of an adjustment I have to be careful how much I say yes to and how much I say no to. I take a day at a time, but in a year, I like to think, I feel like it's possible with this diagnosis to have my full energy back. At the moment, I still deal with the ghastly fatigue from time to time, but in a much more accepting and calm way, not always. Well, I was going to say, I mean, I've got to ask if there's comedy projects in the pipeline. You know, I'll be, I'll be sort of told off by some of your fans if I don't ask what's next. Well, actually, I've only finished this book really recently. Normally there's a bit of gap between publication when I've done things before. And so by the time I'm doing interviews, I've started to have new ideas at the moment. I haven't had that sort of space. But I can't wait to have that gap and sort of sit in the garden and see what ideas to send. But, yeah, I do feel this book was a very authentic, vulnerable, more serious tone, although there are a lot of laughs in it. So we'll see which way it goes, whether I end up going much more serious, I'll go back to silliness. I do crave silliness, we'll see. Something that I think a lot of women in particular will relate to because we know autoimmune disorders disproportionately affect women. I'm very struck in my own experiences of medicine dealing with endometriosis, adenomyosis and trying to figure out how to live with something for which there is no cure or real understanding yet. How many times I've been told to go and get antidepressants? And there's a real place for antidepressants. Absolutely. And I just wondered what you would say about specifically on that point around women and misdiagnosis and actually the direction of you've got anxiety. Well, I think first it's very easy to sort of blame doctors and be angry with them for doing things like that. But they are ultimately trying to fix. They don't know, you know. So I've had to go on a bit of a you know thing to kind of forgive people who would just pass me off or what one experience as you mentioned was really bad that i chart in the book but all anyone wants is to be heard accepted loved and seen and when you're not particularly in a medical situation, it's the worst. It really is. And so I would say there is hope. I think your instincts are right. You know, that for me is the absolute key that your body does tell you the truth. Keep researching what's right for you. I know it's exhausting, but I'm getting emotional just to think now that there could be somebody who felt like me 10 years ago listening to this. You know, this reaction is how hard it is. So yeah, you're not alone and I hope the book helps. On a much lighter note, I really love the suggestion of how you say to structure an invite to have people around. So can we just talk about this? Because you say, and I've done it now, have people around, TV, tell them the end time. Oh, yeah, absolutely essential. So I think this is my gift to the world, is how, because that's another reason we're also blooming it's also because we don't meet our needs when we socialise. Intentional gathering, that's what I call it. So decide how you're going to, who you're going to meet and why. So for me, it'll be, there'll be a group of girls that we've watched strictly with. And I very much tell them when the show is over, you will be leaving approximately 9.35 because I wish to be in bed at 9.45. And then when they know there's a structure, I usually give much more of a detailed structure, by the way. It'll be 6pm arrival. There'll be drinks at 6.30. It's 7 we shall eat. 7.30 you watch the show. Everyone says they're genuinely like thrilled. This is the best night. And then I will shout, there'll always be one who's on the sofa. The show's ended safe. It's a strictly watching party. Who's digging in and going, we'll always be one who's on the sofa, the show's ended, say, if it's a strictly watching party, who's digging in and going, right, we'll have another drink now and start chatting. And I'm going, absolutely not. Open the Uber app, please. Forthwith. But it gives so much freedom. I think it's also people are scared of putting boundaries up or putting things like that up, thinking it seems rude and not loving. And actually, it's the most loving thing to do. I think doing it in advance is so clever because I'm the person who does it while you're there. I'm like, it's time now. No, no. That's a rookie error. Yeah, I know. And you've changed, you've changed my approach. You've changed your life. That's what you're saying. I've changed your life. Miranda, thank you very much. It's my pleasure for changing your life.
