The present is a gift, and I just want to be. I'm Rick Edwards, and this is Fighting Talk. Welcome to this festive fighting talk. Welcome to help me nurse this raging hangover, not a hangover from drinking, but from six hours on the M6 and the M1 and various B-roads with a toddler yesterday. I will leave the questions to a selection of Five Live and the BBC's most beloved podcasters, some of whom I have literally heard of, which brings me neatly to the panel. Who was both available during the tricky Christmas to New Year period, fondly dubbed the Perineum, and willing to do the show for the frankly laughable appearance fee. It is four fighting talk regulars who need no introduction. So, as we've got a lot to cram in, it's not waste any time. The First Lady of Fighting Door. She's a lady. Hello. Good morning. Yes, I'm very well. I was in here anyway, so it's fine doing three hours of the breakfast programme. So no problem toroyd is here. Hello. Morning, Ellie. How are you? Yes, I'm very well. I was in here anyway, so it's fine, doing three hours of the breakfast program. So no problem to hang on for a bit longer. Yes, I'd like you to make it feel a bit more special than say that you came in. Of course. Especially for you, Rick, and the fighting talk listeners, of course. I'm going to ask the same question to everyone. Level of festive cheer remaining from 1 to 10. I would say I'm on a solid seven and a half. Seven and a half is good actually. I think I'm on about a four. I've had enough sleep. All right. No toddlers. Yeah, well, that does help. Next up, we've got the Tour de France guy. Bicycle. Net Bolting's here. How are you, Ned? All right. Thanks, Rick. All right. Still sticking with that music when I get introduced. Once we've got the music, we stick with it. That's one of our things. Lovely. Uh, level of festive cheer. Two and a half. Yeah, yeah, very reasonable at this stage. You've got to be honest. Yep. Uh, and also with us today, Leighton Orient, Torval and Dean and Bowles, Crown Green, fan. Bob Mills is here. Morning Bob. Hello, mate. You're right? Yeah, very well. Thank you. Uh, level of festive cheer. Skyhigh. green fan Bob Mills is here morning Bob hello mate you're right yeah very well thank you level of festive cheer sky high sky high I've got my kids coming around this afternoon and tomorrow I've seen them fleetingly over Christmas but only the least no no it's not well so where are you at between one and ten between one and ten I Between 1 and 10? 10. 10? That's amazing. Alright. And fast Olympic medal winning runner. Running, running. Running, running. As on the nose is yours really, Ned. Nathaniel Mitchell Blake. Hello, Neth. How are you? I'm doing what yourself? Yeah, I'm all right. Level of festive cheer, please. I'm probably at a one. I quickly have to make sure. Yeah. I push myself in any festivities because I can have over eating. And what I do for an occupation outside of being on Radio 5 Live, once in a blue moon, requires me to be in good shape and eating Christmas dinner four days after. It's not necessarily the best thing to do. You must burn it off quite quickly though. The way I felt in training yesterday was very very scary. Oh man, that's horrible. I only had three days off in fairness and actually regret taking any time off to be fair so I'm back at it tomorrow morning I'm going to go to the sauna and try to sweat some of this Christmas cake out. Okay, well, send me a photo. Now, that is your big hitting panel. Let's do question number one, and it is set by this cult hero. Jonathan Pye here, news reporter extraordinaire, and I love nothing better than a good old rant. So I want you to give me the best rant you can about a sports story of 2024 that really got under your skin. Start with you, please, Ned. I can't, I'm not going to be able to rant about this, but it has been a low level irritation for the best part of 12 months. It's like a grit in the oyster of this one. And it relates to Ali Pally and the World Darts Championship. And the fact that last year the final was graced by the two Luke. It was the Luke Derby. It might well end up being the Luke Darby. Actually, they're going to meet in the semi-final this year probably. But it was Luke Littler, the 16-year-old last year, who made all the headlines, grabbed all the headlines. And the thing that people forget about that is he didn't win. He got quite comprehensively beaten in the World's Championship Darts final last year by Luke Humphreys, who himself is one of the youngest ever world champions. He's got an amazing backstory, turned his life around. He's a brilliant darts player. He might go on to win another five, six, seven world championships. He's a lovely bloke. So Littler was just going to have to wait in my eyes for his big moments. For me, it's all about the boy Humphreys. Well, we have both Luke's come in to five live breakfast and I've got to tell you one of them was great value And it wasn't littler Ellie He's 17 Rick Michael, but yes, okay, carry on This could be a topic for every year really You know, every year pretty much for the last Kind of 40 years, I'm guessing Women playing sport, talking about sport, getting abuse On social media, on the street sometimes, you know, sitting in football grounds. And not just, you know, the sports women, apparently, I was looking at an Australian survey apparently showed 87% of the sports women that they surveyed had been abused on social media at the start of this year. So this is the start of this year. We've seen World Athletics have offered support to some track and field athletes, female track and field athletes, 25 particularly who get an inordinate amount of, not just low-level abuse, but just abuse on social media. It's been 40 years this year since I first reported on local radio on cricket, 40 years. And it's still happening. You know, we just want to do our jobs. We want to get recognised for our jobs. We want to be allowed to do our jobs without people talking rubbish. Not so much. I mean, I think I made the very wise decision to start my career before social media was a thing. Yes. But, you know, you think about all the amazing women that we have on this show, you know, kind of your Kate Masons, your Natalie Pikes, you know, people like Laura Woods amazing broadcaster and journalist herself. Just every time they post something on social media, they get, I'm not going to say the word, but they get rubbish in the comments. And, you know, and you shouldn't have to go through that, really. Yeah, the word very nearly came out of early's mouth and I was quite excited for a moment. And I'm no Rachel Byrdon. I'm going to go with Australian break dancer Rachel Gunn who came to Paris for all the smoke but she might have left her rifle at home because it was definitely stifled her. Her performance resembled a baby attempting to walk and the only thing she was breaking whilst doing so was my eyesight. It was such a hard watch. It was so soulless. Her performance was so bad. It actually just continued the sport and it's kind of interesting that's happening because LA is, I was what America is to say, is the home of break dancing per se. So to continue the sport in a country whereby it was birthed, it's just go to show how alarming her performance was. And what I also found out upon doing some deep diving research about Ms. Gunn was he's actually the oceanic world champion for breakdancing, which is even scarier because that whole continent on a whole needs to completely stop participating in breakdancing. I think you not. Well, that is fighting. So breaking your eyesight is excellent. Bob. I'm going to go anti-Pedian as well, Nathaniel. The Commonwealth Games fiasco that's unfolding. The Victoria, we're going to do it, and then they can't afford it. And the Australian Prime Minister said, no, if we've got any spare money at all, we need to spend it on a lot of other issues than a games event. And then everyone suddenly turning against it and then everyone comes out, well, of course, the Commonwealth, whether the Commonwealth's dead. Oh, well, don't do it then. Fair enough. Because listen, I'm sure if you're a leading sports person, you look at the world championships, you look at the Olympics at the top. I don't know where the Commonwealth Games goes. And Bowles, which is the only sport that's in it that really matters. Because it's the only in the Olympics. Bowls is only in the Commonwealth and it's a world championship. So, you know, they will survive, believe me, without it. So if you don't like, just, just let's, don't, what I would like. Permission to let it lie, basically. Let it lie. Rather than let it stumble on for another four years and then four more years until it becomes held in, you know, the, the regional baths in Stockport or something like that. Let it die gracefully. You would like to see it at the regional bath in Stockport. Every event as well. Everything Everything grabbed in and everything. We're coming out your line from a car park outside of the weather's posing. Surely it's a Commonwealth game. They've drained the pool and they will be doing the bowls in here now. Where do you stand on the Commonwealth Games, Neff? Do you know what it is? It's an interesting one and I don't want to get too political about it. But the essence, I guess the birth of the games is definitely questionable to me. I'm not the biggest fan of his origin and it's a shame that it doesn't get the consistent support of the nations that be to pull out when it's supposed to be in four years and you really claimed it to happen. And now it's happening in Glasgow, but it's a watered down version. I do think that in the near future will be discontinued. Too serious, that answer. I've stitched you right up there, but you lose a point. Right, question number two, forget the listener question. We've got someone from the highest rating show over Christmas. As you'd expect, it is all about the telly. Hi, Rick. Hello, panel. It's Natalie Cassidy. Hiya, it's Joanna Page here. And usually you'll hear us on BBC Sounds talking all things on and off the telly in our podcast, Off the Tele. Now, our favourite TV of 2024, for me, it was rivals. Oh, I love that. The cheeky, fantastic, Jilly Cooper adaptation by Dominic Treadwell Collins and co. Starming my friend Danny Dyer. I thought it was absolutely amazing. And the good news is it's back for series two. Oh, I can't wait. One of my favourites definitely was The Traitors. Oh, absolutely loved it. Loved Claudia, loved all of the cast. I can't wait because it begins again on New Year's Day. Oh, I just become obsessed with it. I'm watching the New Zealand one at the moment. Fantastic. I just want to watch four things traitors. So yeah, that was a massive fade for me. Oh, please. John, the celebrity version. What's the question? Well, what we want to know from the panel is, what is the best sporting moment off the telly this year? Finally. Good Lord. Whoa. Bob. Well, okay, I'll make this quick as I possibly. Please, please do. Normally you say, people have a go out of me. Why'd you have to drag late and or in and everything? Because this was three minutes of football on the television that was shown on all the major sporting programs, on all the major channels. Ninety-ninth minute, we're 1-0 down in the FA Cup about to be knocked out by, believe it or not, non-league now, Oldham. We've got a corner, so the keeper goes up as he always does. Slightly different. Our keeper has been paying attention throughout his career to how people have been scoring goals from corners. So he gets two players to run for him. They run, they take the defenders away. He comes from nowhere across the box, flicks it in, bang. One all, we're into adding on time, which we then score again, because we're a proper football team and we train hard. No. I watched some, not all, of sports personality of the year for the first time in years, and my eye was caught by the moments on telly. I don't watch much telly, but this was stellar. It was the contribution by a friend of mine, Sir Chris Hoy, who made a speech under the most unimaginably difficult circumstances in which he outlines the dedication, the rigours and the honour and the privilege of competing at the Olympic Games and the Paralympic Games and in the circumstances in which Chris is facing down the challenges that he's got, it just spoke of the measure of the man. He's an absolute titan. He's a very funny, very intelligent, very warm, amazing human being. It was a brilliant one. What a guy. Ellie. I am going to go for something which took almost as long as that question took to ask, actually. It was the Olympics opening ceremony in Paris. On the banks of the Sen or on the Sen itself. And I tuned into the briefing because I was doing the commentary on the radio with alongside Alastairns, and Julianne. Which was so good. Which was such great fun. But the TV version, well, we, well, in the briefing, Tomé Jolie, who was the artistic director, said, the son will be the minactor in our drama and it will glint off all the buildings as it sets. Yeah. It pulled in. So many, so many for all the buildings as it sets. Yeah. It pulled. So many points for the accident there, early. Absolutely. Absolutely. It checked it down with rain. But so we were doing it on radio inside a studio, outside, in the rain, Andrew Cotter and Hazel Irvin, who did an absolutely extraordinary job of keeping it going while the water was dripping down the back of their necks. And it reached the point where you get to the, you know, the Olympic flame, the final bit of the torch procession, which went on for a very long time. But you didn't know who anybody was. So in the briefing notes, it said, this next song will be sung by a well-known French singer. Contradiction in terms, you know, there are no globally known French singers. And the torch relay had a list of the people who were going to carry the torch, who a lot of them were famous French sporting stars. And we had Jules with us, who, of course, as we know, is the loveliest, best French person of all time. The greatest French person of all time. So he could tell us on the radio who was who. But Andrew and Hazel didn't have that. So they had a list of names, but they were in alphabetical order, not in the order that the torch who was who. But Andrew and Hazel didn't have that. So they had a list of names, but they were in alphabetical order, not in the order that the torch was being handed. So, I mean, you know, the most amazing shift was done by Hazel and Andrew to get that over the line. It was really good. It was really good. Nathaniel. Keeping it on the theme of Paris there, as a sprinter, I was fortunate enough to be at the 2021 games, especially being that during the pandemic, which was the weird time for all of us. A sporting spectacle with no spectators, obviously, other options are available. But I would go on to the games that were in Paris, that is. The 100-meter showdown was one that we were all awaiting. The build-up was immense, but I disqualify myself from watching that on tv as i was in the stadium so i'm going to go to the women's 800 meters where keely hodgkin took the crown previously being the bridesmaid and the two prior championships storming home in an emphatic victory uh it was amazing to watch and haven't seen her train in person i really believe she deserved it and i'm excited to see what she does in a near future and ultimately with that she that, she took on the BBC Sports Person at the Year award, which is also kudos to her and great for our sport. But great, great, great, great. Big Keeley fans on this show. All right, next up, this is pure fighting talk. Over to you, Amber. Hey, I'm Amber Hag. My podcast is called Bad People. So tell me, who from sport should I be lining up to feature on my podcast? Nice question. Bob, and just quickly, before you get into your answer, what have you scrolled down on this week? Listen, when I'm doing my notes, it's usually only in the morning before I come out and I have to be very quiet because of the dogs. I don't want to wait the dogs up because they'll wake up the rest of the street. Understood. So I grabbed the nearest bit of paper I can, which is to be a Christmas card. From? From Becky John, Samuel, Spike and Megan. Happy Christmas Christmas. But written to Bob, Jan, Dolly, Fifi and Rumi. Because in my street, we include our pets in our Christmas card. It is, that is. that's the way it goes. Awful stuff. I'd never heard of, what have you written down there? I'd never heard of David Coot. Ah yes, lucky you. I pay little attention to referee, especially in the, you know, in the third division. They just, they're basically local post office work. You know Fulfilled the ability to turn up on time So we don't take them with any seriousness at all But David Coote seems to be quite a remarkable person I'd always thought them as being people with no personalities But anyone who can you know enjoy the kind of social life that he does And work can keep the energy to slag off the whole of Liverpool and Klop in particular I thought he was quite a character and I'm sure that when he was doing that there were no friends around who could say you know this isn't going to look good don't you but he just he says to his mate obviously this can't go anywhere yeah you know I don't think that's quite says to his mate, obviously this can't go anywhere. Yeah. You know, I don't think that's quite going to cut it, actually. Unfortunately for you, that is. Obviously, this can't go anywhere. Famous last words. Nathaniel. I'm going to go for Diego Maradonna. Now, he wasn't just the footballer. He was a walking so proper with the ball at his feet. Take the hand of God, for instance. Only Maradonna would blatantly punch the ball in the back of the net and had England's curse into the heavens and have the audacity to say it was divine intervention. It was the kind of cheekiness that made other fans adore him or despise him. Minutes later he scored the goal of the century, dribbling past the whole team having England looked like there were a bunch of cones on the pitch. A rascal or a genius. Who else would warm up the disco music like they're about to hit the dance floor at the World Cup final? Some say Maverick, I say Maradona. Then onto its post-goal activities, the bar gas celebration of 1994 when he run into the camera, only to be disqualified for the whole tournament. Now, let's not get to off the pitch. Off the pitch now, this escalated into the pesky journalist attack, him stamping on somewhere outside the courtroom in Argentina. Diego didn't just play football. He lived the game like the game was his pitch. Real, real, real bad man. Apparently, if you watch the clip of him stamping on that guy, he does say in Spanish, obviously this can't go anyway. Can't leave the courtroom. Can't leave the courtroom. Can't leave the courtroom. Interesting theme developing along these answers. Let's see if Ned continues it. Well, I doubt your listeners, many of you will have heard of Henri Pelisier, but he was one of the great French cyclists in the early years of the Tour de France, the early decades. He won the 19... It's like a famous French singer. He was. All the famous French singers are dead. That's the problem, isn't it? Sares Gansborough and all the rest of the list. Yeah, that's true. Anyway, going back to Pellissier, he was the only one of three brothers, all of whom raced the Tour de France, to win it. He won in 1923, ending seven years in which Belgium had won the Tour de France. Now, the Pellissier brothers have been brought up in abject poverty on the outskirts of Paris, where their father would run a dairy farm, and they were sent out to go and rip grass from a park in Paris to feed the cows, and they'd be beaten by their father. It was a terrible upbringing. Henri Palisier of a bad group of brothers was by far the worst. And when he retired from racing, he drank, he was abusive, he was unfaithful to his wife. And one day it all got too much for his wife. And unfortunately, she took her own life with his pistol that she took out of his draw. But the tragedy doesn't end there. Because a few years later, his mistress, his young mistress, who'd moved into the family home, then went upstairs, opened the same drawer, took out the same pistol, came down to the kitchen, and shot him dead using the same pistol with which his wife had taken her own life. Happy Christmas, everybody. I was going to say, I think my Christmas spirit is down at one now. Ellie? Well, I have looked into this and I think she's been the subject of several documentaries, at least one feature film, a self-penned autobiography, funnily enough, because that's what an autobiography is. But I don't think she'd ever been on a podcast. So Tanya Harding, you know, because I mean, she was never found guilty of involvement in the plot to belt her rival in the kneecaps before the 1994 Lillahammer Winter Olympics. But her dodgy ex-husband was, and a load of his associates were as well. she competed I was there I was there in the hammer training rink when the two of them took to the ice together in nine and I mean there weren't so many cameras so many camera crews journalists around the world it was the one of the biggest dramas you'll ever see in sport but she had a pretty checkered career after that as well did a bit of boxing but yeah Tonya Harding definitely definitely a subject for a podcast as you'll ever see in sport. But she had a pretty checker career after that as well. He did a bit of boxing. But yeah, Tonya Harding, definitely, definitely a subject for a podcast. Superb answer. Right, let's have a quick check-in with the scores. Ned just behind on 15, Bob on 17. Ellie on 18, Nathaniel out ahead, in spite of his Christmas accesses, on 19 points. Talk much yourself, go to try and squeeze in a couple more before we go to the news. So this one is from a voice very familiar to Fighting Talk listeners and Love Island viewers. Hello everyone, it's occasional Fighting Talk panelist and co-host of Murder They Wrote. That's a podcast to the old people that are listening to Radio. My name's Ian Sterling. Can you tell me about a time you've watched your team play and thought, oh man, we are getting murdered out there. Ellie, Arsenal, getting murdered. No, I wasn't going to mention Arsenal. I was going to do a cricket answer. It was exactly three years ago today, to the day, third day of the boxing day test at the MCG, Australia against England. England bowled out for 68. Yes. Australia won by an innings. The ashes were gone. Scott Boland, a bloke who barely played, you know, hadn't had a distinguished Australian career up to that point. It hasn't really had one since then either. But took six for seven on his debut. Nuts. I'm absolutely crazy. And of course, this is partly in tribute to the great David Lloyd, who you remember when England tied a test match against, Zimbabwe went out and said, we flippin' murdered him. We flippin hammered him. But no, you didn't, David, you didn't win the game. Anyway. Ned. Well, I don't support a football club, so I was really hampered by this question. But I've always considered myself to be firmly in Team Southgate. And I was one of those people who defended him to the hill and wheeled him on to succeed in everything that he did. Up until, I have to say, his recent appearance on Desert Island discs. And during his musical selection, I'm afraid that the brand Southgate got murdered. It was like, it was the carpenter's the water boys, Ed Shearing Adele, the whole lot. It was like basically listening to a kind of doom loop of Magic FM with that whole vibe of being caught in an overheated Uber in a traffic jam in the North Circular at 4.30 in the morning. It was the most Southgate thing I've ever heard and it frankly ended it for me in Southgate. One sort of small point of order from me is obviously it's completely fine for everyone to, you know, like what they like and not like what they don't like. But I find it very suspicious you don't support a football team, so you lose a problem with that. Nathaniel. I'm going to go for Arsenal's infamous eight-toe drobbling by Manchester United in 2011. It was less of a football match and more of a demonstration on how to humiliate your rivals. By the time Man United's got the eighth goal, Arsenal fans were definitely googling what the Europa Conference League looks like, or sorry, rather, Europa League looks like. And I feel that after the eighth goal, the referee should have called the game off early for cruelty to all gooners. After the fence looked like it was auditioning for a magic show because they kept making themselves disappear And the fence had the structural integrity of a soggy biscuit and whilst Man United Tax ran rampant like kids in the sweet shop And back to your cricket reference The score line was resemblance of a cricket match and never ever in my primary school years have I felt the embarrassment like that Have you had a writer for this episode? You've got some, you're putting out some singers today, Neth. I appreciate you. I put a little eff in. You have. I like it. I do like it. It's not going to unnotice. Bob. This is, it's an answer, but the question should be slightly different. Have you ever seen your team in thought, we're getting murdered out there? Because it's not always a bad thing. We went to the Emirates, all right? They asked them a 1-0 up at Brisbane Road and Jonathan Tahoei scored one of the finest FA Cup goals ever and we've beaten your one-all. Okay? So we've got, so we now come to the Emirates, about 7,000 of us turn up there. Sit around, look at the... Comfortable seats, say. Look how much room you've got. Stretching our legs out, turning around. Put some on the celly, put his tendons on. It's fabulous. And we got beat, we got beat 5-0. Nicholas Benton scored a hat trick and came up to the world and turned down and pointed to his name on the back. We're going, mate, let us tell who we are. That's more important. And it was a great note, it was a great note, we had a great note. And sadly, it's a night that very few supporters will get now. Because the AFL, as always, because they know the price of everything and the value of nothing, took the money and gave away the replay. Which is one of the saddest moments in sport. Disappointing. All right, a quick one before we go to the news. Yeah, we'll go to the news moments. Disappointing. Disappointing. All right. A quick one before we go to the news late. It doesn't matter. So this comes from, I don't know who this person is. Here we go. Hi, it's Rodald Jung Jr., host of the Pop Culture Debate Club podcast. I am a huge fan of the Olympics, and this year I probably watched the most that I ever have. Watching live sports is always such a thrill, especially sports that we don't regularly get to see, like skateboarding, rugby, and honestly, table tennis. But trying to unfold the drama of live sport through a narrative lens like television or movies is not easy. You're limited in the context, and sometimes it's just hard to depict or recreate the authentic feelings of live sports. So I'm wondering what has been the worst example of trying to recreate live sport on screen? Well, when he got to it, it was a good question. But it felt like when you've got an essay at school and you have a certain number of words you have to write, you're just desperately feeling. So sport badly replicated on film or TV. Nathaniel. I'm going to go for goal three taking it to the streets. Anybody remember that movie? I remember the first one. I don't think I was all the purpose. Goal three is the absolute worst movie ever. It was an embarrassment of a plot. I mean, it made the offside rules seem straightforward of how convoluted it was. I mean, the acting was so wooden. The players looked like they were more focused on not tripping over each other than actually playing football. And they kept making these weird intense faces like they were constipated while I was training on the pitch, which wasn't the most. That's what I'm saying. The low budget movie, poor food on set. That's probably what it was. And the theme song was terrible. And in short, the goal scoring action was so poor. You know when the goalkeeper like dives in slow motion? It's like they had so many budget cuts that they couldn't actually dive in slow motion. So they just went. Remember that song by the streets where they actually jogged in slow motion? Yeah. That was the goalkeeper diving to save the goal. And what really upset me too, I followed the first two Newcastle, what's happening here. It was more about training and poor pippies. A very, very surprised it got to a third. No one's ever heard of it, that's why. Ned. Do you know what I just watched, on that subject, I watched Mike Bassett, England manager, for the first time in my life, which is age of film. I think it's good fun. But it's a terrific film. And actually, weirdly, the football recreation in that is pretty good. It's not that bad. It's not bad. It's not like meme machine, which is very, very poor. No. It's much better than another sport that I love, Darts. There's a film, a very obscure American film called Dartsville from 2007. The name says it all. Yeah, which features, it's an American film and it's about a trailer park in the Midwest where everyone's got a mullet and there's a big darts tournament there, except they fundamentally misunderstand the point of darts and they throw each darts as if it's a baseball pitch. So with one leg looking in the air, kind of like that, and the only object of the game is to get a bullseye in every single shot. Now that's the point of the game. It ends, however, with the last line in the film is pretty good, I have to say, where one dance player turns to the other and he says, you see, there comes a time in every man's life when he realizes that everything he's ever known is absolute crap. Apologies, except dance. I think you should have committed a bit more to the accent, but probably good. Ellie. Well, I mean, this is an Oscar-winning film I'm going to mention now, Invitus, which was the film about the World Cup, the Rugby World Cup, with South Africa winning in the most dramatic circumstances. You know, it meant so much to the Rainbow Nation. You've got Nelson Mandela presenting the trophy to Francois Pina, where, you know, Francois Pina played by Matt Damon, Nelson Mandela played by Morgan Freeman. But it's something about the action on the field, it just looks so staged as if they've got a choreographer into it, rather than actually having people who actually knew how to play rugby. I mean, Matt Damon didn't even know what rugby was, but I remember interviewing Francois Pinar a couple of years afterwards and he said that one of his big memories of that moment when Nelson Mandela wearing his own number six shirt presented him with the trophy, is that Pinar was so nervous that you get pulling his shorts up. So he was standing there and he pulled his shorts up. He said, my shorts were almost up around my armpits by the time that the trophy was handed over. So he said to Matt Damon, just whatever you do, please don't, please don't pull the shorts up. Just try and make me not look quite such an idiot when it comes to the film. But yeah. So great film. Terrible rugby. Bob. Terrible rugby. The only decent rugby film ever has been this sport in life of Richard Harris. They had no, they just had Wakefield Trinity players. The only one that's ever done properly in football is the Arsenal stadium mystery where they cut into an actual game between Brentford and Arsenal. There's been some great boxing ones, some American sports can do it because they have gaps in them so you can make it. But the football ones are the worst. But sometimes you come across a football one and you think, oh, I'm going to watch this over and over again because I love Brian Cox. I love Michael Keaton. I'm a huge fan of Robert Duval. And if you mix those up with Ali McCoyst, which you should. Then shot at glory is a film that I urge everyone to go and have a look at. I've got a theory which is the best sports films are the ones where the people are wearing helmets. So they're wearing helmets so you can put anyone in and you can get all the action to look great. No helmets you got problems. Remember the Titans, classic. Classic. And for some reason, danceville is really stuck in my head. Just the idea that in the entire production of that film, no one stopped to say has anyone checked our dance film. And everyone's just like, I don't assume it. I mean, how hard can it be? It must be this. All right, that's it for the first half. We will be back with a second after the news and the actual sport. Hello, welcome back to fighting talk. Welcome back to, sorry, about to get the giggles here, welcome back to our panel. Any old Langsyn droid, Bob Manet Mills, Ned Year's Eve, and I couldn't come up with anything for Nathaniel Mitchell Blake. Just take a moment if you need it. I don't have writers on this show. We are on the BBC Sounds app as well, which means if you've just joined us on the radio, you can go now and listen back from the start and then you won't miss hearing natalie cassidy and joanna page's two-minute review of the year's telly onwards oh i haven't got a bell with me today so let's go with uh nice um game changer time five points to be won and lost and it is posed by this beloved radio two and TV light entertainment stalwart. Good morning, Rick. Good morning fighting talkers. Claudia Winkerman here, the orange one. Traders is back in January, but what I want to know is, who is sports biggest traitor? That's how you do it. Claudia, that is how you do it. That was perfect! That's why she's so good! Biggest traitor, Ellie. For many, many years I went to see Arsenal pretty much week in, week out, persuaded my younger daughter that she should be an Arsenal fan, from, you know, when she was quite little, used to take her to the Emirates as well. So she got very invested in Robin Van Percy when he won the Premier League Golden Boot, 2011, 2012. At a time when Arsenal and Man United were great rivals, it was the peak of Venger against Fergie. And then Robin Van Percy goes to Manchester United the following season, wins the Premier League Boot again and wins the title. And so in our house, as christened by my younger daughter, Robin Van Percy was always known as Pooh-Poo Head. Bob. My mother, by the way, was 95. God bless her. Still refers to Stanley Baldwin as the traitor Baldwin. But no one listening to this show will understand. But there we go. Okay, over Christmas, I could have had a nice funny answer to this, but over Christmas, my nephew Connor came over. I've got lots and lots of nephews, but he's one of my favorites. He's a lovely, and he's a gay boy. He's a gay man. Well, no, he's 17, but he's one of my favourites. He's a lovely, and he's a gay boy. He's a gay man. Well, no, he's 17, so he's a gay boy, I suppose, who's at catering college, and he's a huge Liverpool fan. And at the drop of a hat, we'll talk about Jordan Henderson. And it's never nice. Yes, yeah, it's a good answer. It's not a funny answer, but it is a good answer. Nathaniel. Similar to the theme of Arsenal here and someone who, adversely, I love in this sense, but he's a trait for what he did to the rivals, which is to my benefit. Product of Tottenham's Youth Academy, who later went on to captain his club after six years in the senior ranks this gentleman ran down his contract and got a free transfer coming to Arsenal so Campbell earned his sport as sports ultimate traitor swapping the white kit for the red and white after he crossed the bridge arsenal fans couldn't believe their luck after getting a free transfer and what made me laugh is the end of the season interview where he scratched his chin and was kind of like, I don't know, I don't know. And then he walked into the press room, joined by Arson Venger, and went on to become invincible and with many, many titles. And you know what always makes me laugh? When he says, I always wanted to win the league at White Hart Lane, that's why I joined Arsenal. That absolute audacity of this man. Soldiers did across the North London divide. He built a luxury bridge and strode across it with a smirk, forever cemented himself as football's Judas. I sat next to him once at an event and he had, I'm going to say, quite a strange energy. Ned. Terrific politician though, wasn't he, Sol Campbell? Let's bear that one. Quite a strange energy. Ned. Terrific politician, though, wasn't he, Sol Campbell? Let's bear that one. I don't know about this one. I've heard into the world of the Olympics with this one, the Winter Olympics specifically. I don't quite know where the line is drawn because we're quite familiar with people just in football and in the Olympic sports as well. Maybe changing nationality once, having represented a nation at the 23 level, that's a legitimate, but often there's a familial or heritage reason, like, you know, Ghanaian and Nigerian to England or all there, in France, it's often Sierra Leone and Cameroon to France, or like there's a financial tie involving Qatar and Eritrea and stuff like that. But there's an Italian downhill skier, alpine skier called Alessia di Poe, who's only 29 years of age. And she started off representing Italy in the giant slalom. It wasn't quite good enough to actually represent Italy at senior level. And then spent two years, and I can't fathom why, skiing for India, between 2011 and 2013 representing India to no great success. And when that particular journey ended, she popped up at the Sochi Winter Games, finishing 55th out of 74 skiers in the giant slalom. She wasn't top, but she was representing Togo. And the only reason that she could give was that apparently her dad owned a sportswear manufacturing factory in Togo. The whole thing stinks to me. I respect the hustle. All right, another question now from a fighting talk regular. And unlike the rest of these clowns just reading through a script, and I include myself in that, he thought of this question all by himself. Hello, Fighting Talkers. It's Alice James here. Like every year in 2024, I've genuinely thoroughly enjoyed the Nations League. I love it, I think it's one of the best things you wafer have ever done. However, not everyone agrees. So what sporting thing do our fighting talkers think is unfairly maligned or misunderstood? Yes, of course the Nations League is a complete waste of everyone's time. Nathaniel. I'm going to go for the special one, who I truly believe makes football better I mean it's a bit like Marmite you know either hate him or love it obviously other condiments are available especially during the festive season a man who can manipulate the media and written press like no other the special one polarising person either hate him or you love him now I'm showing my age when I think he has some of the most iconic memes in football history in world history to be fair the shushing on the field, the shove with Ars and Vengar. Even the other day had a spat with what's it called, Guadiola, when they referred to the Guadiolars 115 charges, went on to say, well, I've never had any charges against my name and still won the Premier League. He's done in every league he's been to, but for some reason, people still don't give him his due credit. I'm an Arsenal fan. So he pushed my favourite manager. By right, I shouldn't like him as when he came into the fray, Chelsea knocked Arsenal off the top. But for some reason, I just have a unique admiration for this gentleman here. I feel like if you play for him, you absolutely love him. But it has been said people that also play for him have gone on to test him as well. Jose Marino, once again, the Marmite of the manager circle. Ned. I'm going to go for something that's very much maligned, often by the wokeery and the snowflake sort of brigade, and that is doping. It gets a bad press in the world of sport. Everyone's got a downer on doping for some reason. But let's face it, some of our most memorable moments down the years watching sport have been, you know, crooked to the eyeballs, pumped up on dandrolone, testosterone, EPO, whatever you want. Let's face it, it makes it faster, better and more unexpected. Yes, please. Ben Johnson fan in the house. Nathaniel's face there. I was like, what's going on here? I'm not involved in this. By the way, I thought of Felice Nathaniel. Oh, that's good, actually. I was going to redo the end. I like that one. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Ellie. I have been presenting Thursday nights on Five Live Sport for a while, and I'm really getting into the Europa League and the Europa Conference League this season, which is very much much maligned as the competition that nobody wants to get into. Unless you're a West Ham fan. Well, yes, that's true. But there's been so much psychodrama on Thursday nights now with Tottenham particularly and with Manchester United. So week after week, you know, we've been discussing, so which Tottenham Hotsborough are we going to see tonight? And which Manchester United manager are we going to see by the end of the season? So actually, you know, Europa Conference League and Europa League, bring it on, even more of it on Thursday nights in future. And actually the new format, I think, really works. Bob? I stood behind Noamon in my hatred when it came in, a VAR. But I watch football in the third division and we don't have it. So if I'm ever at home and on the telly, there is nothing better than watching them, especially when they did, running over and kissing the badge and going on the ground, and even they get as far as the little choreographed celebrations they do, and you're thinking, you ain't scored, mate. It's delightful. It's delightful. You have to take the dark back out, presumably of the bull's eye, not even throwing it properly. All right. Next up, I am hoping that this is question number 10. I think it won't be question number 9, but let's just assume it is question number twin. Twin. Twin. Yeah, all right. All right. I said twin. I meant 10. And it's this guy. Hi, it's Chris Mason here from Newscast and I'm the BBC's political editor. It's been a huge year in politics. There's been elections all over the place, all around the world. But I want to know what has been sports most important vote. That's nice. On the outskirts of London in 1890 on a main road just north of London, a group of cyclists past the woman in a horse and carriage. The horse panicked because of the presence of the cyclists. A lot of the riders fell off. And the woman complained to the police, who then registered their complaint with the National Cyclist Union. Remember this is 1890. They were in charge of the sport of cycling, the new sport of cycling, who then promptly banned cycling in this country. And that ban that imposed, self-imposed by its own governing body lasted until the 1950s, which is why this country has never been and will never be a cycling nation. Wow, that is a great fact, Nick. There you go. Ellie. What should be sports most important vote is who gets the major events, who gets the World Cup. There should be a vote, a voting process for the World Cup. There should be a vote, a voting process for the World Cup. It should be a transparent, fair process involving different associations voting for the most deserving candidate country. When did that last happen? When did it ever happen? It didn't happen under set platter. It's not happening under Gianni Infantino. You know, the vote for Saudi Arabia to host the World Cup in 2034 was done by acclamation. What kind of a basis for democracy is that that countries vote by clapping in front of the camera? How do you think they did arrive at Saudi then? I don't know. It's mystifying, isn't you? Maybe everyone would have voted for them anyway. Yeah. Nathaniel. I'm going to go for sports most important vote now bob you might be better versed than this than me but do they still wear jogging bottoms for goalkeepers in division three yes yes well i'm glad they got and cap and caps yeah sunglasses shin pads what hasn't quite got yet to division three is the stupid big glove they don't have that they don't have those socks down there as well yeah yeah so so um but i'm so glad they got rid of it in the premier league i'm not sure if it was a vote but it was a fashion nightmare not saying football's all about fashion now but jogging bottoms just made it seem so sunday league and i feel like a bit more lower tiered not having a go at lay an orion at all here by the way and i'm not sure if that was a vote but what i will allude to is way and I'm not sure if that was a vote but what I will allude to is Jackie Robinson in 1947 would they voted that black players can now integrate in their MLB partly because one he was so good two they needed the money and three his talent was absolutely undeniable and he had to be a mainstay in the game hang on how did that well how do we get from joggy bottoms to win? Because I don't think joggy bottles really a vote. That's what's, okay, okay, Ellie's thing wasn't a vote. His first thing wasn't a vote. That's why I did have a vote in there. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. You're absolutely right. Ellie, you lose a point. Was the vote. Neth, you lose a point. But I did have a vote in there for Jackie Robinson. Did I not? Okay. Okay, back to neutral. Bob, give me a vote, please. Voting, certainly in football, is the exact antivity of what voting should be, which is early point in there, should be open and transparent. Nobody was aware of the vote that we could never replays anymore. And seriously, when did I miss the memo that a vast majority now of lower league football teams don't print programs You go to so many matches and the argument is our well kids just have got it all on their phone They've got all the team. Yeah, they haven't got the when these last met who's represented both or my little column that I used to be asked to do so apparently all the matters now. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think we all understand why Bob's upset. He's lost a bit of work there. All right, on to, oh, this is question 10. No, no, no, mind. Not just elections here, but also in the US in 2024. So let's do this. Hi, it's Mariana Spring from AmeriCast and Why Do You Hate Me Podcasts. Can I ask the panel, which American sports star is the most iconic embodiment of America the Beautiful? I like that question. I'd like to keep this quite swift. And I start with Nathaniel. I'm going to go for Peyton Manning. I feel like he epitomizes an American sports person. He's the apple pie. He's the creme de la creme. Great career, stand-up guy, model player in the sport, and what I will say is gonna have an amazing career and punditry too. Peyton Manning, what I would say embodies America the Beautiful. Also he's called Peyton and no one who's not American is called Peyton. Ned. Yeah, Michael Johnson, beautiful runner, a beautiful mind, beautiful human being and also an American hero that clearly no one in America cares about, otherwise he wouldn't be stranded in a BBC studio, pretending to care about the fortunes of the British relay runners, occasionally, but not in your case, dropping the baton. So he's gracious as well as beautiful. It's a really terrific, which you won't see. It's obviously good at this radio. So it's sort of patronising tap there on. Yeah. Not anymore, not anymore. Had the enormous privilege this summer to spend a lot of hours watching Simone Biles, who absolutely, you know, the greatest Olympic gymnast now. She came back from the mental torture of Tokyo, the online abuse, I refuse, I think my first answer, and came back to take her Olympic tally to 11 in total. She is just the bravest and the best gymnast that we've ever seen. Bob. My God, what's happened to this program? Oh, they fought a great better than they came back. Oh, they're wonderful. They're a great man. They're a great. Listen, sport is about winning, which is why America win more than we do, because that's all they care about. America, the beautiful beautiful I refer to my learned colleagues previous answer Tanya Harding prepared to do what it takes I've realized I didn't award the five points for the game changer or take the five points off we're just going to have to just go on and I'm not worried about that too much. Let's pretend that never happens. Yes, exactly. And it didn't. OK, time for Cappanmore. Here is Laura Whitmore. Hello, it's Laura Whitmore from Murder. They wrote, my co-host Dean Sterling was left devastated earlier this year when Yergan Klopp left his beloved Liverpool. What are you predicting to be the biggest shock departure of 2025? Another quick one, Bob. I think June, July at the latest, the player power in the dressing room is going to have it say and Lee Carsley is going to be back where he belongs and Tommy Tuckle or be back at Hamilton. Tocultoon of Dusseldorf or whatever he's from. That's a new. I'm going to go for the Premier League to be without any Manchester teams because one, I think Manchester United probably get relegated. And Man City, they might probably get relegated too due to their 115 or 125, whatever many charges they have. Alleged. Alleged, of course. If you'd said back in August that Manchester City would be booed off the field on Boxing Day after winning only one game in 13, I mean, you'd have laughed, wouldn't you? You'd laugh if I'd said that. But I don't think it's impossible to imagine that Pep Guardiola will walk away. He'll just decide, you know, he did four years at Barcelona and said that that felt like an eternity. He's done eight years now at City. So it could be Pett. Ned. And on a personal note, and appealing to 2% of your listeners who care about this, shock departure after summer of 2025 is that the Tour de France will be disappearing from free to air television and going behind a paywall for the future years to come. Like so many other sports before it, it will be vanishing over the horizon. And that personally is a shame, I think. It's such a shame. Right. We're going to finish with a one-worder, and this is posed by Five Lives Brilliant Breakfast Show, co-hosts, no, not her. And pretty much voice of the network, host of the station's most popular podcast, very first sports podcast, fighting talk, and here it is. Please sum up 2024 in one word yeah that is the sort of delivery that you can't teach you we're either got it or you haven't so one word for 2024 please netaniel meadow ellie mannett yeah that's nice and enjoy the accent ned humphreys Yes. Ellie. Magnific. Yeah, that's nice. I enjoy the accent. Ned. Humphreys. And Bob. Sport wash. Is that two words? No, it is one word. No, it's not. Two words. No, it's one. It's one. All right. Well, we go a bit late, but there's not that much sport on this afternoon. I think we're all right. Any other business? Ellie? Christmas TV, at the top 10 programmes in terms of ratings on Christmas Day, were all on BBC, because nobody else bothers. People don't try, do they? ITV have given up. Gavin and Stacey, absolutely fantastic. 12.3 million viewers. Biggest audience sold Christmas Day for 16 years, I think. Wallace and Grom. A question was very long, wasn't it? It was very long. But even so. Wallace and Gromit, absolutely fantastic, full of brilliant visual jokes. You haven't watched it already. Strictly Come Dancing, which featured not only a former host of fighting talk, but a regular panellist on Fighting Talk as well. So I want to know when the next Olympic sprinting fighting talk panell is going to be on the Striction Christmas special. That was a little wink from Nathaniel. I could see you doing it. Yeah, I could see you do that. Give me a bit of time. I can't really move my waistline. It's not really a marine. I'm sorry. Straight line, you know, right? Run hard turn left. But who knows, who knows. But Harry, I'll give you some tips, I'm sure. He's always been dancing. Trust me. I've roomed with him on many trips. He wakes up like that. Does he? There we go. Anyway, so the next time somebody says, why are we paying all this money? Why do I have to pay my licence fee? Just say, Gavin and Stacey on Christmas Day. Ned. What a hell? I can't remember. Oh, yes. Yes, yes. If you, yes. If you are a Londoner, if you live in London and you travel outside of London, specifically to the north of this country, and people, when they find out that you're from London and live in London, tell you to your face and quite directly and explicitly how much they hate London. I find that quite extraordinary. Yeah, because it's not like we're going out to the north. I hate it up here. I hate it up here. I hate it up here. Nice, growing live. How can you in Yorkshire? Yeah, I get it. Nathaniel. I have a question for you all now. How long is too long to eat Christmas leftovers? Like, you've already passed it, haven't you? I've already the turkey and cranberry sauce sandwich this morning. So, but I do feel like I should just keep going. I'm looking a bit swollen art time. But what what I will say the fridge was so full that the turkey was out by the window so for two days so I'm not sure if I should continue eating it post a day I've been cold and a thrombole to kill the chur well I have a strong stomach you see you know if at any point in your training regime someone you're training for with the the relay says, Oi, this isn't a bat and it's a pig in blanket. What are you doing? Then you've gone too far. Yeah, there we go. Raining. I'm always curious about that one there. How long is too long to eat leftovers? Are you guys to eat leftovers? My strict thing on this is you've got to get rid of it all as quickly as possible. Make it into a soup. Seat. Yeah. Sandwich, I made a great turkey curry. They want to talk about it so it all as quickly as possible. Make it into soup. Seat. Seat. Yeah. Sandwiches, I made a great turkey curry. They want to talk about it so much, but it was fantastic. Never had that before. Yeah. Oh, you'd love that. Yeah. Um, Bob. Okay, weird thing, Christmas, we're having our house done, all right? And in about September, my daughter said, is your kitchen going to be done and finish for Christmas? Because if it is, we'll come to you and we'll have a lovely, you know, we'll have to that. And we didn't know. And we said, we don't know. If it is, it is. If it isn't, we'll do something else. And my daughter said, no, no, no, no. If you want to go out for Christmas dinner, you've got to be booking now. Okay? This is beginning of September. He said, even now, it's slightly too late. So I said, well, let's book it. And then if it's, you know, the Christmas thing is, the kitchen is ready, and we'll cancel it. So we booked it. The only spot left in the whole of Essex, 11.30 in the morning, right, in a pub. Plus, you've got to pay every penny, every shekel right up front. You pay up front and tell them what do you want to be eating. In September? Yes. yes yes as you make the thing so we wound up doing that in fact the kitchen was ready but we'd already pay the money up front and I have to say you're selling out a lot of money there Bob kitchen house meal what a delightful experience oh it was really nice they were lovely the staff were lovely it was full there was families there it was really really and then when it finished, you got up. No leftovers. No washing up. So you have no leftovers now? Nothing. Yeah, that would be good for you. That means you have to cook a boxing day. Yeah, swings around about. I have leftovers. I have a supply. I have a man who comes around. Don't worry. He knows a guy. Gives me his old stuff. All right, let's have a look at the final scores then. Oh, it was tight. Ellie and Ned on 39. Bob on 40, Nathaniel on 43. So Bob and Neth go into the head-to-head. Defend the indefensible, ridiculous statement. You have to answer it. It doesn't matter if it hurts. If I say I, I mean you, Nep, you scored the most points, so you go first. You have 20 seconds on the cruel lot. On the following. If it wasn't for my own relay leg in Paris, the team would easily have won gold. I mean, unfortunately my my talents weren't that of what they were of yesterday years. But he's taking the toll on me, so I don't think I was in the best shape I potentially could have been in. To be fair, I think I gave Zainauta battle in six. He looked like Super Mario on the ankle leg that had just had the magic mushrooms. No drugs, no, that's funny stuff. Had rapid speed on the ankle leg. And it's funny because we were tent for first. If I were an attempt fast, the potential could have got pulled he's still going he's still going that actually quite cathartic for that I actually do feel like that and really that was actually uh I passed the line and was like that I should have done more that was sort of defend the very much defensible defense this is what I believe all right Bob um now you're like this one as well, I think. You have got 20 seconds on the following. I'm glad Tovlandee will do their last silly little ice dance in July. To be honest, I've never liked them. Yeah, I'm glad to see the back of them. You know what? Over the years, they've milked it time and time again. So good luck, good ridden. I hope your careers are over. And also, the injunction is one of the cruelest things anyone from use in law, all right? 50 metres? I don't know what 50 metres is. Sometimes I think 50 are. No, I'm too close. Well, you know what? It's a really hard one to adjudicate that because Nathaniel really, really, it was, I could see it in his eyes. He believed it. He believes he let his teeth let his team I did have to think log about it you're going to kick a man when he's down I think I think I'm gonna have to give it to Nathaniel just just for the honesty congratulations thank you thank you champion I had it off my chest it felt good to get off my chest yeah for the new year and you haven't let anyone down today champion going into 2025 Ellie Ned Bob pretty terrible starts a new year. And you haven't let anyone down today. Champion going into 2025. Ellie, Ned, Bob, really terrible starts a new year for you. Thanks for listening. Very happy New Year to all of those fans of the Gregorian calendar out there. This has been a World's End production for BBC Radio 5 Live. In the podcast Extra, we're going to be ranking the best sports podcast and if you think I'm not putting this show at number one, you have lost your tiny mind. Hello, you'll listen to the podcast extra of Fighting Talk. Now, I couldn't come up with a good pun for Nathaniel, but luckily Ned has. I'm just going to do the intro again and then Ned if you could just do the honest. So, welcome to the podcast Extra of Fighting Talk. Welcome back to our panel. Ellie Old Lang Zindroid. Mm-hmm. Uh-huh. Bob Monet Mills, also good. Ned Year's Eve and Felice Nathaniel. It's really nice. It's very good. It's really nice. It is very good. We didn't manage to get through all of the questions from our podcasters. So we're going to go with this from the newscast team, who I know for a fact between them, no sweet Fanny Adams about sport. Hello, as one of the hosts of newscast, I, Adam Fleming, would like to know. It's been a year of cabinet comings and goings and comings again for some of them, but which sportsmen or women would sit in your sporting cabinet? Nathaniel, assemble your cabinet for me. I'm going to go for sporting director, Asim Wenger. I'm going to go for chief negotiator, Denzel Washington. All of his movies, isn't he like the most persuasive person? You wouldn't want to, like, drop him the wrong way. He's a very persuasive individual. Liam Neeson would be... Not the most famous sports person, but... drop him the wrong way. He's a very persuasive individual. Liam Neeson would be... Not the most famous sports person, but... No, no, no, but this is a fiction. Come on. Work with me here. All right. Also, podcast, you can lower your standards. Yeah, there we go. You guys take it all too serious. I'm going to go, Liam Neeson, like, head of security, but all, like, the serious stuff, because he will find you where he is and the whole spiel. Another actor. there we go and head of like marketing not that there is one in a sports cabinet but I'm gonna go Beyonce because she's just a good idea I mean it's an extraordinary line up of non-sports awesome yeah yeah but also very political none of them descriptions of cabinet ministers I know but apart from that I missed that part I miss that part you can be in it too Rick if you want but yes what am I None of them descriptions of cabinet ministers are. No, no. But apart from that, it's terrific. I missed that part. You can be in it too, Rick, if you want. But yes, what am I? Erb, you want to be. I'll be prime minister. Thank you. Do you remember? Oh, sorry. No, no, no, nothing. No, no. I think there's only me and Annie. Maybe in Ned as well. Do you remember when they just wanted you in the cabinet? But there was no jobs available. And you used to be the minister without portfolio. What a gig that is. They still got them. Yeah. Two past 50 lunches still, yeah? Yeah. Minister without portfolio. What do you do? Nothing. I'm just sort of, I'm like a vibes man. Yeah. You just balk whenever they say. Yeah. Yeah. Knock on the, knock on the deal. Shame. Yeah. He's really good whenever they say. Shame! Yeah, yeah. He's really good at doing that. I found this out. Sorry, I'm, I'll shut up. Why do you just go? No, I won't. I won't. You know this. I never went to university. I left school when I was 15. I got on with my life. I never had any further education. My brother, who's a very highly idea. I found out from just checking him out. Actually, we were having a game and we were going on Wiki. He is Professor Emeritus of English studies at Manchester University. You know what Professor Emeritus means? I do. I do. Is it like retired professor? No. It means you don't have to turn up, but you'll get paid anyway. In fact, they would rather you didn't turn up. You've given up, but you've still got the title. Is he still getting paid? Yeah, of course he gets paid. He's still a professor. Emeritus. That's an elite gig. That's a sham. What a gig that is. That's a sham. We're working too hard, guys. We need to just become like all Professor Emeritus. It's Fight and Talk host Emeritus. Emeritus, yeah. Yeah, I mean, probably will be quite soon. Ellie. I kind of think you want Roy Keene in there somewhere, don't you? Yeah, yeah. I suspect he's probably not going to be the ambassador to the United States. Or anywhere, in fact. So I think I'm putting me in as my defence secretary. Yeah, good, good. A chancellor of the exchequer, I mean, you could have anybody who's just a bit reluctant to spend money. I mean, I'm like Daniel Levy, for example, eventually. And you've got to have a spin doctor, so it's got to be Graham Swan is my spin doctor. Oh, that's very nice. See, that's a very thoughtful cabinet. It's been put together with sports people and names of people in the cabinet, Neth. I don't know if that's of any interest to you. Bob. No, I think you do have to have a spin doctor, the director of communications. But there's your job for arson. Yeah. Could you just please tell us why the government have decided they're going to spend 37 billion? I didn't see it. I wasn't at the meeting. I had to go and visit. I got a friend does rap music. I had to go and visit. I didn't see it. Because the late point of first thing, because I promised David Lammy the gig, a friend does rap music i had to go and visit i didn't see it as um because the labor first thing because they promised promised david lammie the gig you're going to be foreign secretary you know they disill and you can't go back on that because no one expected trump to win the american election so no one thought that our most precious partner in the whole of the world was now going to be ruled over by someone that David Lamy had described as an idiot and a psychopath. That's the key. So just for that reason, you don't know offend. I'd foreign secretary, Joey Barton, straight up, straight in there. Oh, God. Bang, there you go, Joey. Just diplomacy. That's the name of the game. I can't stand that guy, actually. You don't like Joey? No. He's misunderstood. No. He knows some big words. He does. Yeah, he does. I've heard him use them sometimes. Some of them in the correct way. I've never heard that, actually. Ned, who are you whacking in? Well, similar vein, actually, Foreign Secretary, because as I said to you earlier, I just finished watching, because I was a bit ill, so I was lying in bed, watching Mike Bass actually, Foreign Secretary, because as I said to you earlier, I just finished watching because I was a bit ill, so I was lying in bed, watching Mike Bassett, England manager, which is good lying in bed being ill fair. And I thought, isn't it amazing how Mike Bassett, Ricky Tomlinson, sort of wins over the world with his direct blunt 4-4-Effing-2 sort of like approach? And I was thinking along similar lines, because he's a real person, Sam Aladice is Foreign Secretary, because we're global Britain now. We've got to stand up what we believe and take our message out to the world and he's going to do just that, isn't he? Yeah, unadulterated. And look at his England record. Exactly. He's undefeated, right? Impecable. Just give him like a lifetime to play a chewing gum. Yeah. And I'll pick him and then Chancellor of the Exchequer, I'd have the Ineos head honcho, massive patriot and Monaco resident at Jim Ratcliffe, Sir Jim Rackler. Don't forget, sir. He would almost certainly abolish tax for everyone, because that is what he has chosen for himself. A bit of politics, sir, and I enjoyed it. All right. Shall we do the, ah, yes, the Ricks rankings. Today, predictably, having had an episode with questions posed by podcasts, as we are going to do the top five greatest sports podcasts. One each. Nathaniel, who do you want to put in there? I'm going to go for filthy fellas. Comes on every Wednesday. Just a bunch of guys around talking about their wildest football takes, but it's a good pastime for me, hour long, and I watch it religiously. Filthy fellas. Oh, is this a podcast that you watch on YouTube? Well, it is an audio as well, but I do watch it on YouTube. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, that's a thing up there is, is a camera. A rectangle thing. Yeah, you're on camera. Bob looks horrified. Bob can't believe it. I know. Bob, who are you putting in there? I don't know any sporting podcasts. I genuinely don't. And I found out, just from chatting with someone, that the rumour mill didn't count as a podcast. Because apparently once you've done a radio show, you then have to add a little three minutes at the end. You can get the extra money in a podcast. Squeeze a bit of value out of it. The rumour mill, which wasn't a podcast, it was just a broadcasting, but if you never heard it, it should be a podcast, because everyone should be able to listen to it free. It was Steve Bunce during the transfer window, talking to sports journalists, football journalists about what was going on in the world of transfers, the rumour mill, and it went something like this. So, big news they call Sunderland. The backfalls fall into pieces. They're looking for a central defender. What have you heard? Well, you know, there's a lot of good ones available. Yeah, but who specifically? It could be anyone at seven, really. Give me a name. No, I'm not going to give you names. You're right. That should be a podcast. Ned. I'm very much taken at the moment where Ali Pally's on with a darts podcast called Unsirious Darts that's co-hosted by Andy Dawson, who does Atletico Mintz. Yes, yes, yes. He's a Sunderland's man. And how does this work? Well, he sits, he watches the darts, and then he sits in his living room with his son, Oliver Ross, I think his name is, who takes the Mick out of him mercilessly, and they discuss what they've just seen, except very quickly they lose the plot of talking about darts and just end up talking about anything. So they don't actually talk about darts. There's someone whose name I'm not going to mention, because once you're no longer hosting this show, you're dead. All right? And when we did a show on the station, we had what I think was the greatest radio, which could become the greatest dance. And we were talking proper dance players. You know, I don't know all their names, but they all the proper, proper darts players took part in it, right? And it was, it was honesty darts. They sat in their houses with their phone in one hand and their dart in the other, and they threw it. It's a great item. They threw all three. And they, and they, I don't know why. It's just, in sync, they would go, double top, double top. Double top. Dole top. That is very good. That is very good. Ellie. Well, it's a BBC podcast. Of course it is because, you know, I'm a corporate girl to my fingertips. And also it's the other podcast in which, or the other show in which I have a title, an honorific as it were, because I am theoretically, according to the podcasters, or podcast hosts at the queen of this show, which is Tail Enders, of course, with Greg James, like Jimmy Anderson and Matcham Tendorka. You know, just a brilliant, brilliant podcast which does everything it's supposed to do into bringing sport to people who wouldn't normally be interested in cricket. And they've been amazingly successful. So they just talk about cricket. It's a loosely cricket-based podcast. So you've got your Radio One breakfast show presenter. You've got your guitarist from a massive indie band, The Maccabees, and you've got James Anderson. And you've heard more from Jimmy, you know, it's kind of, I mean... Jimmy opens up on that in a way that he never has done. And they've done some fantastic stage shows. I don't think you need to be a fan of cricket to enjoy that. You don't, you really don't. No, it's also brought my elder daughter into cricket. Well, they go. She's a massive Greg James fan as you, as any normal person is. And so she has developed a love of cricket. So in my focus group of one, they have succeeded. The good ones I've found, but I've done many more than I've listened to, because I don't really listen. Because I don't know which buttons are pressed. When they say, go to whichever platform you normally use, I think, well, I use Platform 1 if I'm at Leone's station. Other than that, I don't know. You're just pressing the information button at the station. The ones that are really good, they skirt around things. There's a brilliant one that I did called, again, I forgot what it's called. But what they do is they say to you, right, they phone you up and say, is there a film that you saw that you sort of remember but not quite, right? And you say, yeah, there is. And you give them the same. And they talk to you about that film. And then they say, right, don't do anything else. Don't look it up. Don't watch it again. Because what we're going to do is tomorrow at this time. We'll send you the link because they can always get the link. And we're going to watch the film together separately, but at exactly the same time. And then we're going to watch the film together, separately, but at exactly the same time, and then we're going to carry on with this podcast. And it's fabulous. That's a nice idea. It's fabulous because you say, you tell them what you think happened, and then they think, so where did all that come from? I don't know, but I was positive that he killed that bloke. And yet they became lovers. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know what they're the good ones. And they're the good ones in sport. The problem with too many of them in sport is that they very quickly turn into what they think people are going to be interested. This is a problem with any sport. Yes. And what podcasts are. The difference between what the general public actually care about and what people who are in control of sports broadcasting think they care about is magnificently huge. I've never come away from a game thinking, why did we play the false nine? Why don't we use the channels more? You just come, you walk away from football and think, how's he ever going to score goals with that haircut? Yeah. And the ones that do it like that, they're the good ones, aren't they? Are they? I mean, so what I'm thinking is you should start a podcast called, how's he going to score a goal with that haircut. Can you imagine me trying to do a podcast? It would go roughly like this. Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? And that'd be it. Someone said the other day about their day. It was telling the story. It was quite a charming story. His father had passed away at 102. So it was, you was telling the story. It was quite a charming story. His father had passed away. And 102, so it was, you know. And he said, and the great thing was, I got to hear his last word. And I said, oh, what was it? He said, what did he was? I had spoken to him on the phone. And I said, okay, what was the last? It said, the same last was it. Oh, what was what? Which is, how do I turn this off? Yeah, I get that straight on the gravestone. That's right up there with spite Milligan. Yeah. Yeah. Very good. Right. So I don't know. Have we got all of a, oh, hang on, Mike. But I'm just going to put in Fighting Talk. And I don't particularly think I need to justify that. But I will say that when Fighting Talk was first released as a podcast, it predated the term podcast. So the podcast didn't exist. So when it was first released with Christian O'Connell, it was a digital download. Digital download. Don't forget, there is a digital download. Yes, exactly Don't forget there is a digital download. Yes, exactly. You'll listen to us on 94.8 VHS in stereo. 1548 on the medium way. Yeah, so fighting talks in there. All right, let's have a look at what we've got there. Your top five greatest sports podcast, Filthy Fellas, which is a podcast but Nathan Neal watches. The Rumour Mill, which isn't the podcast, wasn't the podcast, wasn't sports podcast. Filthy Fellas, which is a podcast, but Nathan Neal watches. The Rumour Mill, which isn't a podcast, wasn't the podcast, but could have been a podcast. Unserious Darts, which, to be fair, is a podcast. So we've got a podcast, good. Tail Enders absolutely deserves its place in there, fantastic podcast. And this one, Fighting Talk. That's your lot for this week. Thanks, everyone, and happy New Year to everyone who celebrates. Lovely. The Football Daily Podcast.
