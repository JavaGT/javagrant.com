It's like a never-ending cycle that just seems to come full circle. I'm Rick Edwards, and this is Fighting Talk. Good morning, and what a morning it is, in a week that's already been a cracker for fans of managerial appointments. We will be interrupted shortly for the naming of the new leader of the Conservative Party. And I checked with Conservative Party HQ and they confirmed that they specifically wanted the announcement to be made during a lighthearted Saturday morning sports panel show. It just gives it a bit of a lift. I've also been asked by the five live bosses to play it with a straight bat, so we'll find out how straight they think the air horn claxon sound effect is. Now, I did, well, I wanted to play it then. Didn't, oh, it's not working. That's a real shame. Oh, there we goes. Now, I did get in a bit of trouble with some fighting talk regulars when I proclaimed that a recent episode was the favourite of my tenure. Apparently I shouldn't have favourites, but come on, the quality of this show is not consistent, and we all know it. At the risk of upsetting more people, I looked at this week's line-up and thought, this is a great lineup. So for pity's sake, now do not disappoint me. These are the beauties who are giving me a very pleasant tingle, making his seventh appearance, and he's reached the final three times out of six so far, only to be schooled each time by a Fighting Talk legend, losing to Oldroid, Mills and Morehouse. Luckily, no current Fighting Thought Legends on this episode, surely some future ones. Rapper, author, broadhammer, Governor B. Yo. How's it going? I survived half term. My first ever won, man. I'm happy. Yeah, completed it? I wouldn't say completed it. Yeah, it happens. You've got it? I won't say completed it. Yeah, it did it? It happens. You've got that sort of haunted post-half term look in your eyes. I'm not a good guy. Yeah, of course he's a good guy. He's great, I love him. You have too late. You've come very close to a winners today going to be the day. Looking at the competition, I think it might be. Oh yes, immediate. The fighting words. Point. Now, I think it might be. Oh, yes. Immediate. The fighting words. Point. Now, on four show number 11, looking to break a streak of finishing last on each of his most recent four shows, not the form that once took him to the Fighting Talk Champion of Championship, way back in 2022. Fullam fan. Hosted Jaguars UK on Sky Sports NFL. Radio One Extra and Legend. I miss him on there. Nice to get One Extra and legend. I'm missing one there. Nice to get my fix in person. Reese Parkinson. Happy post Black History Month, Rick? Yes, well, exactly. I mean, we've put this wisely. Very, very wisely. Have you hit it for the year with this show? Yeah, I think so, yeah. I think so. And now we're done. And now we're done. Fantastic. Now we can just take our foot off the gas. Now, Reese, you are, you're done. And now we're done. Fantastic. Yeah. Now we could just take our foot off the gas. Now, Rhys, you are a, you're very smart man. You've got fingers in pies. What is the most exciting pie that you're currently fingering? Oh. Rees? No answer. And On for the 10th time. He is an impressive five-time champion, including reaching defending and defensible every time he's been on under me. It's not favouritism, I just like the guy. He's only ever lost one final, and that was last time when he was too cool and blazee about initially being announced the winner, typically arrogant sprinter. Arsenal fan, proper athlete, Olympic medalist. Nathaniel Mitchell Blake. You make me sound like so much more than I actually am. I forgot that I'm an Olympic medalist, Nathaniel Mitchell Blake. You make me sound like so much more than I actually am. I forgot that I'm an Olympic medalist there. No, you didn't. Did you? If you forget that. Every morning you wake up, we're like, oh yeah, Olympic medallist. Well done me. Thank you for having me, man. I'm excited to be on the show and Governor B started the war already. So we realised we've crossed paths quite a bit, so it's going to be an interesting one. It's about the East London right now. I that I like that I like that um why are you in Arsenal fan if you're East London uh my parents supported them and I guess you know all right all right I mean your Olympic medals just dropped out your pocket man that's the one that's the one that's the chocolate one if if you do win today you need to come correct with the celebration I want to see sort of Noah Liles jumping up and down with COVID stuff. He was in a wheelchair for that one actually. Yeah, he was a wheelchair afterwards. Beforehand. I raised him in Boston, right? Yeah. And he actually got a fake gun out and he ended up like going, pshu, so I'm going to do something like that. Okay, very nice. No more sound effects though. Sorry. Did he beat you? Yeah, he did. Yeah. And finally, fightings, 411th ever panellist and 9th Australian, of her eight countrymen or women, two of them won on debut, Adam Hills and Mark Weber. Neither of them came back on. I don't know why that music's come on. She is a cricket fan who admits she doesn't watch Premier League football, very much looking forward to her answer on who will be the next manager to be exacted at question four. And of course, her take on the ball on door. Remarkably, just taken on the David Brent, Michael Scott role in the Australian office on Amazon Prime, thereby massively increasing the chances she will never be back on fighting. Felicity Waters here. Hello, mate. Hello. How are you? Yeah, I'm good. I'm outnumbered, is what I am. You are about to go stratospheric, so I feel like we need to cherish our time together. You should cherish your time. I'm actually too good for this show already. I completely agree, and I will give you a point for recognising that. All right, let's get on with it before we get interrupted by the Conservative Party. It is the sweet spot for fans of lollipops dressing up fireworks and attempts to blow up Parliament. Halloween last week, bonfire night next, but what in sports screams, it's autumn. Governor. Well, as a West Ham fan, I was going to say nothing tells me it's autumn like when we make a bad start to the season and the countdown to 40 points begins. But I've actually gone for the NFL London Games, live from the likes of Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, where even the most clueless of NFL fans, myself included, pretend to know what they're talking about just so they can get a taste of this quintessential American pastime. Now I'm taking a mick out of myself here because I've been for the last two years and I've still not got a Scooby Dewa's going on. This year I sat next to Troy Dini, who looked equally as confused as me. In fact, the only person I've seen at the NFL down the game that actually looks like they know what they're talking about is Reese Parkinson. Dura! Anyway, back to not watch the NFL. See you in a few months for the Super Bowl, mate. Nathaniel. Similar to Governor B, I'm going with the NFL, but being that I lived in America for nine years, I guess I have more of a sentiment towards it. Okay. So Thanksgiving football. So you understand it, you tell him? Yeah, I would say pretty well too. Coping my friends at NFL too. Jaguarie was absolutely terrible on that note. But it's the colors that ever broadcasted, the browns, you tell it? Yeah, I would say pretty well too. Copy my friends at NFL too. Jagu was absolutely terrible on that note. But it's the colours that ever broadcasted, the browns, the greens, the oranges, and of course you're always associated the NFL with the fall. Jampack football all day, spectacle, absolute bliss. But apart from the team that wins celebrating, they get to stuff themselves with a turkey. Now this turkey now is a tuck durden, which is a D D-Bone chicken stuffed into a D-Bone duck. That's right. Stubes to a D-Bone turkey. Yes, please. Between the layers of meat, the chef puts a load of stuffing in it and because there's typically two legs, they said, why not make it four or six? So right after the game, opposed to celebrating with their families, they get to eat a cold turkey on like TV. It's very, it's a great stuff actually. Uh, Rhys. Name me one quarterback, Nathaniel. Go. This is good, yeah? Yeah. Yeah, me. No, you know. Hey, hey, hey, hey, wait. Wait, wait. Wait, wait. You understand the question, so answer it. I'm going to Joe Borough, LSU graduate. All right. I'm Lamar Jackson, Baltimore. Oh, okay. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, yeah, cut. No, calm down. This is stressful. It's a point. to Nathaniel and it's a point off for Reese. What? And now everyone can settle down a little bit, because we are going to go to Chris Warburton. Hang on. There's the air. Yeah, serious. Chris Warburton with some news. Hello, Chris. Yes, indeed. Hello, Rick. Yeah, Kemi Badenock is the new leader of the Conservative Party. We've just had the result in central London. 72.8% turnout from party members. She was the favourite going into the contest, really, and most thought that she would probably be victorious today. And so it has proven to be. She's got a real job on her hands of course not least the need to change the party to unite the party to restore trust in the conservative brand and coming very much from the right of the party as well you can hear in the background some of the applause there that she has just received after the announcement she's victorious after this deliberately long leadership contest allowing for a period of debate and reflection after the crushing general election defeat four months ago now. And those Conservative members who have voted for Kemi Badernock will look to her direct style and hope voters will see it as a strength. Big questions remaining around policy and exactly where she will take the opposition now. She will be giving her acceptance speech in a short while. And Rick, don't worry, there will be more on this in an extended news special at midday, which I will bring to you. Plus continuing coverage now on the BBC News channel, live news stream on BBC Sounds and News Online as well. That's it for me for now, though, Rick. Do I get a ding for any of that? There you go, lovely. I'll take it. I'll take it. I'll take it. I'll take it. Look, I'll be honest. I don't think that's going to make it in as a feature for the show in future. Just interrupt, we were in such a nice flow and then it's quite dry, isn't it? Felicity. Let's get back to what in sports screams it's autumn. Well, I'm from the other part of the world. I live here, but autumn for me obviously means it's the beginning of the cricket season. And the beginning of the cricket season means for some reason, of course, we're talking about David Warner again. We are constantly talking about David Warner. Just ban the guy. Just ban the guy. But what they've done instead is they've lifted the lifetime ban He's getting a farewell tour He's making his commentary debut And he's now talking about coaching the team in the future The future is bright if you want losers on the team I am very anti-David Warner I don't like I'm so I'm so angry Why is he still in the team? Why is he opening? Why has he been opening for years? All right. Just hand on, hand off Lester's shot. Sorry. It's quite upset, I think. You held his hand. Why can't you hold mine? Come on. I need some support. I've had too much coffee. All right. Question number two comes from you, the listeners, who are posting now. What's your problem? Is he kick me out? What's your problem? Because I said, I don't get to answer that. No, I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think. I didn't know. You asked the question. That is real. And also, is this why you've got me, Neff and Governor? Because Kemi, we're in. Yeah, no. I didn't know. You knew this is going to happen, did you? I didn't know. It is serendipitous, but I did not know. Go on then. If you're going to have a tantrum, what in sports screams, it's autumn, Rhys. F.A.A Cup first round. Monday night, I'm going... I'm going with the underdog winning Chesham versus Conference South versus League 1, Lincoln City. Autumn is all about the Everett Cup first round and an underdog bringing the win home and going into the second round. Yeah, that is actually quite good answers. All right, now, is everyone happy for me to move on to question? Yes. Any complaints? Anyone want to ask any of the other panellists? I'd like to bring up David Moore. No, Felicity. Question number two then comes from you, the listeners, who are posted on our social media channels. Fighting Talk 316 on X or FT316 on Facebook. And this week's question two comes from Steve Marley. Good morning, Steve. Good morning, Steve. Good morning, Rick. How are you spending your sporting weekend? What are you up to? I'll be watching a bit of football, hopefully. Yeah, I don't need to, actually don't need to elaborate on that. I know exactly what you mean. You've got to watch the football. So let's have a look at your theme then. I'm sure that the producers of this fine show have done the right thing for a theme song with someone with the second name, Marley. So let's just find it. Oh, brilliant. They haven't. That's Steve Harley and Courtney Rebel. All right. Steve, what is your question? Okay. So with Joe Marla deleting his Twitter X account after tweeting that the hack needs to be binning, what other sporting tradition should be binned? Yeah, it's a good question, Steve. Sporting tradition to get binned. I'll start with you, Rhys, so I don't forget you. Yeah, I'm going with, especially in American football, in college America football, halftime interviews with the coaches whilst they're still on the field. So we're going to go down to Lisa, who's speaking to Coach Prime. Coach Prime, how do you feel like the first half when? Man, we got a lot of work to do on defense. That's it. Anything for the second half? Man, that first half defense is bad. Right, got to go. See you later. See you later. Yeah, so obviously, a lot of points lost for the accent. Governor. A newer tradition is that they now have these kind of like face-off interviews a few weeks before a boxing match, where they sit on the opposite end of the table with someone sat in the middle interviewing them. I don't like this for two reasons, right? Number one is if you can sit a room in a room with each other for an hour and not kick off. I don't believe in this fight. It's too friendly. I need a chair flying across the room or something. And the second reason I can't stand this new tradition is all of a sudden the boxers try and turn into Aristotle. But you're not Aristotle. You've been continuously hitting the head for years. So instead of philosophical fight talk, what we get are quotes like this, taken from Finchley's answer to Socrates, Derek Chazora. Have you ever taken those pills? Lactative pills. You know the ones you take, you pop, you wait 20 minutes, and they go through you. I'm going to go through this man. Cheers, Del Boy. The thing is, though, you've sort of destroyed your own point because that is such good value. I've watched that about 15 times. It's brilliant. Also, Carl Frotch, George Groves, that one was amazing. Carl Frotch just keeps saying, easy for you to say because George Groves can't to spit anything out. Nathaniel. I'm going to go for the one-start rule in athletics. I absolutely hate it. Kaman in 2009 and I feel it's killed a sport on the whole. I used to like watching athletics whereby it was a psychological warfare. You might take the Fieldsfold start for them and then you go again. And it's robbed off of great races. Usain Bolt against Johann Blake 2011. I was there. And you know what's even worse about this? The IAA commissioned the study to see what the human reaction could be and they said it's 0.08 but they still hold the threshold that 0.01 which actually shows that and they said they're not in, sorry, they're not putting it into place because the people who they studied were regular humans and not world-class athletes. Suggesting that regular humans would react faster than world-class athletes, which absolutely ridiculous i think i well in fairness i think i'd get out of the box a bit quicker than you um no way felicity firstly can i say i love that steve is so northern that he couldn't even pronounce the last a on hucker is when uck it's stopped heavenly um point to you for that steve. Yeah, thanks, Steve. I don't know if you saw the LA Dodgers won the World Series, which is, I don't know how you can win the World Series when only Americans play. That's another point. But they burned and vandalised buses because they won. I don't know what they do when they lose. So I don't know if you know this, but when men get together, testosterone levels rise. You're feeling it right now? Yeah, yeah. I feel very intimidated and this, but when men get together, testosterone levels rise. You're feeling it right now? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I feel very intimidated and threatened. And when women get together, that doesn't happen. So I just feel like you've got to bin the vandalising and the burning of the games and give men estrogen before they go into any grandfinal. Yeah, I love the idea of the estrogen injections. I'm not sure it's a tradition per se, but... The estrogen isn't the tradition, the vandalising and the burning buses. I'm not sure it's a tradition per se, but... The estrogen isn't the tradition, the vandalising and the burning buses with it. I'm not sure that's a tradition either, really. They don't send out greeting scars for it. Sorry, I didn't realize this was a factual show. My opinion. Well, I'm afraid Felicity, it is. Is it? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Steve. Dr Rick? Where do you want to... Thank you, Professor. Steve, where do you want to give the points? Well, it's not going to be Felicity after that. Mate, I love your accent. I love it. Too late. Two years. Netanyl put a bit of mathematics into it, so Nephaneen for me. Oh, it likes the maths, now. Why does Rees keep rolling his eyes? He just can't help it. Reese is just annoyed. I think Reese is currently on how many, he's on zero points. That's why he's rolling his eyes. He's absolutely right, sure. Rees is just annoyed. I think he's currently on how many, he's on zero points. That's why he's wrongly his eyes. He's absolutely right, sir. Steve, enjoy your weekend of watching the football. Don't tell me anything more about it. Thank you. The next question then is about this gentleman. Infield, Bernardosovo, then Rodry with a shot. And Ariola can't keep it out. Diving down to his left. It's Rodry who's got it. How often is he the man that steps up when Manchester And Aureola can't keep it out. Diving down to his left. It's Rodry who's got it. How often is he the man that steps up when Manchester said he really needed? Yeah, congratulations to Rodry. Winner this week at the Ballon Door. But who should have won the Ballon Poor? And I am spelling that P-A-A-R. I'm not an animal. Nathaniel. I'm going for Calvin Mark Phillips. Oh, poor. You know, poor lad. What for 50 million from Leeds to go to city. He made two appearances as a start, 14 off the bench in two seasons. Got a fat shape where his manager. It's absolutely shambolic. Got labelled as fat from pep publicly. Loan to West Ham and was a flop under Moist to the point where he wasn't even starting for the rest of the season i mean the drop-up is far from a mystery like i don't think shodd holmes could solve it to be honest and i think he might have PTSD from 2021 because he's social distancing from playing football right now it's been really really sad for him lost dropped out the england fray and um i'm not quite sure where's career's going unfortunately and contrary his partner in the midfield rodry run it so um he had a perfect example of what to do but he just the England fray and I'm not quite sure where his career is going unfortunately and contrary his partner in the midfield Rodry Runn it so he had a perfect example of what to do but he chose everything what not to do well poor old Calvert Phillips race see if you can get some points this man could have been playing with Roder himself and potentially getting a look at the ball and door but everything went downhill governor you're going to enjoy this one I don't see Governor tweeting about this man as much as he used to. Mr. Packetta. Ah, yes. Lucas McKeta had the world he was there. He was on the cusp of greatness, and then everything just fell down. He was good, though. Why are you smiling while you say this? And that's everything on the field. I'm not a liberty to comment while there's a live investigation. Good, good, good. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Governor. I know people are going to kick off at this point, but I actually don't care. No, guys, be honest, right? Has there ever been a more uninspiring, uninteresting, predictable and utterly boring, absolute bagsman than Erling Harlanth? Yeah? I know he'll score 50 goals a season. I love it. But he touches the ball about three times a game. He looks like he was made by a chat GPT. I don't think he's got a personality to match his output. He's just boring. He's like the kid at school that's got all the money and the gadgets. No one cares, bro. He's got mad Rocky Four vibes for me. Felicity. Well, as you know, I'm a massive football fan. We do know that. I know everything there is. And so I've been furiously Googling what's happened in football this year. Harry Keel, Mark Vodhukkah. I've heard those names, heard those names. And I found my favourite story. And it's a Turkish player called Samet Akhidan, big fan of this, played in the wrong kit. Now, never has football been so relatable to me. This week, I went out on stage. I'm on tour in the UK. Little plug there. Show's called I'm exhausting. Buy your tickets now. And, oh, come on, mate. No, this is not a plug sort of show. Give me up. Just throw me a bone. You're being brutal for my first. Carry on. You give me the wind up, mate. I'm little, but I will cut you. Honestly. Well, okay. I'm just going to give you a point. There we go. So what happened was I can relate to wearing the wrong kit. I went out on stage a couple of nights ago and five minutes into the show. Someone goes, um, Felicity from the audience. I'm like, oh, what nutbag has come to my show. And they said, your skirts tucked into your underpants. It's a classic. It's an absolute classic and I like it. So your answer is a sort of a Turkish player, but also yourself. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, absolutely. We're the same people. I'm very much like a football player, but also yourself. Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely. We're the same, we're the same people. I'm very much like a football player. I completely agree. Let's check in with the handwritten scores. Right. Rees finally off the mark. And actually, now doing okay. Go on. Five, nice. It's still there. It's not still there for it. Felicity on 10, respectable. That's a surprise. It is. Nathaniel for it. Felicity on 10, respectable. That's a surprise. It is. Nathaniel, 13. Governor just out ahead on 14. All to play for unless you're Reese. All right. Question number four. So he has, he's gone. Losing to a team called West Ham United. It was a humiliation too far for Manchester United and Eric Tenhaug. He's the first Premier League manager to go this season. But who is going to be the second? called West Ham United. It was a humiliation too far for Manchester United and Eric Ten Haag. He's the first Premier League manager to go this season. But who is going to be the second? And I think we'll just get your answer out the way, please, for listening. Thank you. Thank you. I'm glad that you've come to the expert first. Look, given my deep knowledge of the game, I'm going to say, Pet Guardiola. Like, I mean, he's run six league titles in seven seasons. Some say unprecedented. I'm going to say, greedy. Let him go. Is it a him? Is it a him? Is it a him? It is a him. I'm glad you didn't call him a hit. Governor. Ruben Amarim. I know he's not there yet. I think you'll get there. And he'll think how hard can this be? He'll get to training. He'll see Anthony do like a 360 spin and sky it. Love that spin. And it'll think how hard can this be? He'll get to training. He'll see Anthony do like a 360 spin and sky it. Love that spin. And it'll be gone after a few games. It'll just be like, oh, because sports, please take me back. Lethanyl. I'm going to go to Gary O'Neill. I mean, Wolves traditionally change their manager quite a bit. But in Gary O'Neill's favour, if he gets cut now, he'll be able to work on his LinkedIn profile, potentially get a new job after Christmas. You know, I was going to say that actually. Of course you were. He's not got a lot to work with if he's writing about this season. Rees. It's all about to go bad in South London. I'm going with Oliver Glasner at Palace. Yeah. Replace Roy. I felt like there's a very good opportunity to do some good things. I know they've done well in the League Cup. I see like there's a very good opportunity to do some good things. I know they've done well in the League Cup. I see that ending again. Arsenal. Eze's just been injured, I think. Not sure how long. Look at the end of last season. Mechette. It was class. They were so good. And just the opposite. Now it's like, well, they're one place above relegation. So I can see that getting ugly. And I know Parrish makes some big decision like I can do with Vieira. Yeah. You're gone. So, listen, that's some proper pungitry, and that has got you some points. Okay, let's move on to the next. Do you even like us, Rick? I'm iffy. So question number five, are we got time to, yeah, we'll squeeze it in. Stephen Gerard, or as producer Simon wrote in my script, Stefan Gerard has admitted he sometimes staged his training at nine or ten at night for his Al Etifax squad so he can watch Liverpool Games live in Saudi. You've got to respect that, but when have you rearranged everything to suit your own sporting fix? I'll start with Reese, please. I would just like to apologise to anyone who used to go to Blue Water in House of Fraser, especially at Office Shoes, in about 2014. Great time for office. It was a good time for office. I used to work there, and because it was at House of Fraser, you know where you walk up there'd be little stores. It wasn't the office main store, but it was our little concession store. So I'd be there, only one person working, but I'd be in the stock room. And it was the weekend of the Masters, the year the Bubba Watson won. And I just had the Masters on in the board, the backspace. And anyone that would knock for a shoe, I'd just basically say we didn't have it. And the only issue is, there'll be a time where you go, I'm really sorry, maybe we haven't got it. But this is a size six. Yeah. We've only got one of those. Yeah. We've just got the one of those, unfortunately. That is, that's excellent. Nathaniel. Every weekend of my life, today. As soon as I leave here, I'm going straight home towards Arsenal, Newcastle. I've actually scheduled a taxi to pick me up as soon as the game's done so I can get home before kickoff. I don't compromise when it comes to the Arsenal. It's pretty much a fix in my life. I've missed Christenance. I've missed birthdays. Unfortunately I hate to say I missed a funeral but it's for the Arsenal. That is that I mean look they're already dead right it's disgusting but they are already dead. They're not going to miss my presence. Look I mean hallelujah feels inappropriate but somehow I'm doing it. I was too bad in mourning. I don't like seeing dead people I said. Yeah Yeah. What about, have you ever had to race when the Arsenal had been playing? It breaks my heart. Quick full start and you're out. I remember watching the FAA Cup final where we beat, I think it was it at Hull 3, 2, and I'm on the boss right before my race watching it on my phone. Dedication, pure dedication. Governor. It's a great segue, actually. So I was put in charge of the plan on my dad's funeral. Oh, pure dedication. Governor. It's a great segue actually. So I was put in charge of planning my dad's funeral. Oh my God. No, this is why. Oh, no. Oh, God. Don't worry. I'm ready with a hallelujah. I'm sorry to hear that. It's all good, man. I did actually move the funeral, but speaking of my dad. Wait, wait, wait, wait. After he passed, right, I went in my son. It was born shortly after to have a collection to him. So I wrote a children's book called Where Grandad Lives. Now, my publishers chose a launch date of June 8th, and this was planned months in advance. And on release week, they had all this press lined up, print magazines, newspapers, no fighting talk, by the way. I'd managed to get themselves, West Ham, had managed to get themselves into a European Conference League final in Prague the day before. So I spoke to the publishers and said, I will do the press, but I will be in Prague the day before. And if West Ham win, it will be a big night. Luckily, it was a win-win because none of the press cared about the book anyway, so I got the next day off. That's an excellent story. Felicity. I cancelled Christmas in 2006 to see Shane Warren get his 700th test wicket. Beautiful. I flew down. I live in New South, the state of New South Wales, and my sister and I had an early Christmas with my mum. We flew down MCG. The worst bit is just as Shane Warn ran up to get his 700th wicket. We didn't know it was going to be the one. My sister turned to me and said, do you want a Paschiona, which is this like 1980s passion fruit drink? And I went, what? And then 50,000 fans stood up around me and I had to watch it on the replay. And you've never drunk a Paschiona again. Never, never. And I killed my sister that day. And then delayed the funeral. Another funeral. Yes. What a morbid episode. Or it is a little bit. Quickly have a check with the scores before we go to the news. Reese, you're back in this, mate. 15. Felicity 16. Governor 21. Nathaniel now out ahead. 22. That is it for the first half. First half, I think there will go down in history. Embracing as it did a major political announcement. And yeah, I'm hearing in my ear, embracing it not quite as seriously as was demanded. Europe's elite club competition. The Champions League. Right here on BBC Radio 5 Live. On Tuesday at 8. Liverpool versus Bayer Lavercoucun. Header across the face of golden in. Liverpool take the lead. And on Wednesday at 8. Inter versus Arsenal. And watch highlights of every single match with a match of the day. Wednesday night on BBC I player. The Champions League. On 5 Live. Listen on BBC Sounds. Hello and welcome back to Fighting Talk. Welcome back to our stacked panel Olympic medalist, Nathaniel Mitchell-Mitchell-Mitchell-Mitchell-Bake, broadcaster, investor, polymath, Reese Parkinson, star of soon-to-speak global smash, the Australian office, Felicity Ward, and Parkinson, star of Soon-Speat, Global Smash, the Australian office, Felicity Ward, and a man who once appeared in the West Ham United program. Governor B! Nathaniel is currently in the lead. Reese, predictably trading behind it. It can all change, especially given how I've radically reformed the game change of scoring. Now, you might be bored of hearing this, but spare of thought for how bored I am, I'm having to say it. We are on the BBC Sounds app as well, which means if you've just joined us, you can go and listen back from the start, and then you won't miss hearing an Australian comedian, a runner, a DJ and a rapper, give their opinion on who will be the next manager to be sacked. It is the definition of essential listening. Let's crack on. Game change of time, where we mess with the scoring system so much, it pretty much renders the last half an hour. It's a waste of everyone's time, but nevertheless an enjoyable waste of time, where we mess with the scoring system so much, it pretty much renders the last half an hour just a waste of everyone's time. But nevertheless, an enjoyable waste of time. The new government unveiled their first budget this week. Absolute disaster for our panellists. They're going to tax private jets. And the rise in the minimum wage does not apply to fighting talk guests. But what is your budget for sport? Reese Parkinson. So, VAR is at Stockley Park. We install the same system in every pub around the UK. So imagine you're a pub watching a game. You then move from one screen when there's a VAR moment. Everyone in the pub then goes to the next room and analyzes the VAR decision themselves like they do in Stockley Park, in another room. I mean, it feels like it's going to cost quite a lot and not 100% a vote winner. I like it, PubVAR. Nathaniel. I feel that football club should be exempt from paying taxes on the whole. I thought escapism that football provides is absolutely so euphoric, yeah. When you think about it, when football's going on, there's no crime, nothing bad happens. Vandalism is not real. It's just a construct. That's true. That's true. But however, if a game ends nil all, 50% of the player salary should go to the travelling fans for watching a ball fest. Okay, so hang on, I'm writing all this down. The capital is pig. But the headline uses no tax on football clubs. Incredible, Nathaniel. Felicity. This is football adjacent. Okay, I'll take it. This is everyone on the tube gets a pair of noise-canceling headphones after the game. So that when fans flood and you're stuck in a carriage with a lot of very drunk, sweating men singing loudly, you can just pop your headphones on. And while we're at it, all kits for fans have to be made of breathable fabrics. There are some sweaty people out there fighting for their lives, and the people around them are suffering for it. Well, it's the most socially conscious answer we've had so far. Well, that's what I bring to the table. It is. Governor. So after taking my five-year-old to West Ham for the first time last week, by the way, we beat United. I was in the Match Day programme. Thank you very much. I'd like to make sure that every kid has the chance to experience a live 40 match at a price that doesn't require their parent to sell a kidney. I'd raise money for this by taxing anyone seen with a half-and-half scarf. In fact, I'd triple the tax for anyone wearing that abomination. And I'd also introduce a kid-friendly section by the dugout, and I'd make space for this by getting rid of all backroom staff that don't need to be there on match day. I'm sorry, but there is no reason for Arsenal's set piece coach to be getting this much airtime on my TV screen. He's done your job in the week. Get lost. I'm really familiar with his actions now, right? He standing like this the whole time. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He's standing like this the whole time. He knows when his moments coming. Yeah, he doesn't know. Tax breaks for anyone selling players as well at a reasonable price. What is he signalling? You know what he does the house? Front post, back post. I can't tell you the secrets you see. You know, I'm in the nose. You know what that looks like. You haven't got a clue. That looks like the fingers in the pies that you were talking out with race. Let's move on rapidly. So let's have a look. Who's going to get five points? So Pub VAR from Reese. No tax on football clubs. Behave yourself, Nathaniel. Noise cancelling headphones and breathable fabrics for fans. I think's quite nice. And then, but all kids getting to see football at a reasonable price, taxing a half and half. I think I'm going to give it, Governor. I'm giving it Governor. I'm giving'm giving it, Governor. You can say what as much as you're like? What a safe, boring answer? Really, Rick. It's a nice, really. I need to bring my five-year-old into it. I could have, I could have. But I was the bigger man. I was going to say you were the bigger man and I thought, that's a rob it. Um, Governor, your five points. Who do you want to take them off? And you don't have to take them off, Reese you don't have to take them off, Reese. Obviously. I'll take them off, Reese. Thank you. Yeah. As God intended. Yes, exactly right. All right. So that has, well, let's have a quick look. Yeah, that's an absolute shocker for you. The next topic is about this. The Dodgers, a strike away from a championship from a proper celebration. Start the party, Los Angeles. Your Dodgers have won the World Series. Yeah, so New York Yankees superstar, Aaron Judge, having not made a single fielding error all season, muffed up an easy catch in game five of the baseball world series to gift the LA Dodgers a comeback from 5-0 down to a 7-6 championship clinching victory plus the fact Judge led in home runs this season only for his bat to run dry at the crucial part of the campaign so when are the other times that the biggest star went from the goat to a goat Felicity. Well, being a cricket fan, I think we all know what I'm going to talk about. We're going to talk about Steve Smith and sandpaper gag. And he let down Cameron Bancroft. I would say he let down David Warner, but David Warner let down himself. He lets himself down constantly. He let the country down and he let the game of cricket down. And I'm still angry with him. And what I'm most angry about is that he went on the press conference straight afterwards and he and David Warner were giggling like little school girls on the bus as if it was something funny and not something that would go on to tarnish the game and our countrymen even further. Like we have a bad enough reputation as it is, right? I was going to say no one was surprised to find that Australian sports people were cheating. Okay, number one, I want to say something. I was just about to swear. Don't. No, no, no, no. We don't have a great reputation. But that was brazen. And I still struggle. I love Steve Smith as a batsman, but I absolutely still struggle with that. That's a good answer. Governor. I'm British Garnayan. And when I was younger, if you were a Garniam living in England, you had two heroes, really. Michael Essian and Asamoa Jan. Now, Asamoa Jan was the captain of the national team and Mr. Reliable. Also had the best football celebrations, by the way. 2010 World Cup, quarterfinals against Uruguay. We had an incredible one to get there and it felt like everyone was rooting for us. God sent a lifeline by way of the most annoying footballer in world history, Louis Suarez handballing it in the final minute for the game. Asamo Jan steps up, misses the penalty. I cried. I cried. Then he went from goat to wote or a goat. It's heartbreaking just to think about it. Nathaniel. I'm going to go for the sub-tech king, Asafa Powell. Now, Asafa Powell and a world final, it's like a Wi-Fi at a crowded stadium. I mean, no connection, bars drop. And unfortunately, 2004 beating more green than a circuit. Comes the Olympic final, comes fifth. 2005, injured no medal. Now, he did get medals on the world stage but what I wanted to see a arsarp with you was get a global gold world indoors 2014 in Oregon 60 meters this isn't a race that is shorter to his usual distance so he shouldn't run out a real estate in the 60 meters he still managed to choke he came second the matter it's it's staggering how he never how we never performed 97 sub 10 clockings most in world history or time world record holder came into championship touted number one three or four times and then the bolt era came and just couldn't get a grasp of it um felicity has already been i've already just checking him you have a panicking back off you know what this is it that you knew you know exactly what you're doing that did you come on bese i realized what you got to do to win today yeah and i'm gonna so i was talking to my non-existent five-year-old. Yeah, it's a good start. I was talking to my non-existent five-year-old about cricket. Yeah, oh, very nice. Shane Ward from X-Factor. Yeah. I mean, that is awful stuff from you. Felicity Warren and Shade Ward. Yeah. Whilst we were debating Jamaican athletics. Yeah. We thought on a big stage, this man could never get it done. And now the dust has settled. I feel like I can say this openly and honest. Garif Southgate, Euro 96, flop. 20, 20 euros, penalties, flop. Lost us in the semis. Lost another final for us as well. This man could never get it done. Good riddance. Wow. Wow. I think that is fair. Okay. Is that everyone? I'm losing track of things. Let's have a look at my score and that is everyone. Okay, good. All right. Question number, whatever this is. New Manchester United boss, Ribbon Amarin, says he learned coaching from the Jose Marino course at the University of Lisbon, who would you like to be educated by, what would you learn, and where would you study? I'll start with Reese. Nice, I'll take that. We should just do that for now and always be first. So we start with Reese. I want to study a master the art of professional excuses after anything that was meant to go well has gone bad. It's never going to be my fault. I'm going to learn from the one and only Juergen Klopp, and I'm going to study at Red Bull HQ. Anything but, look, it was the, it was this, it was them, it was, it's never me. Are you not going to have a quick go at the German accent? I think that was it. It was that kind of been it. I think that was it. One more go. Look, it wasn't me. No, good. No. No. No. Oh, no. You haven't got a leg to stand on accent-wise. By the way, Nathan, I don't think I don't know. That's true. That's true. What's your answer? I'm going to go Greg Popovich. Now, he's a wine connoisseur. His collection is so impressive, they said he could open up a vineyard. So after every win, I could pair a wine with that, or for a loss, I could pay it with that too. I would want to learn on the coast of South Africa, western cape, up in the hills on the sunset, and maybe he could teach me a little finger two about basketball as they're just handing up money to players at this point in time. That's it. It's a nice life for starters. Felicity. It would be any Italian football player from any part of Italy and what I would get them to do is teach me how to cook the right amount of pasta. Because I cook four strands or six bowls. They're the only options I have. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Do you want to pick an Italian footballer? Can you name an Italian football?? No, I couldn't name one, mate. No, no one. No problem. No problem at all. I'm good on you for having faith in me that I could do that though. I appreciate that. I just thought there must be one that sort of pops in. You'd think so, wouldn't you? But no. No. Um, Governor. I'd like to learn the art of sporting shamelessness from the LeBron James course at the University of Nepotism. As much as it's great to play in the NBA on the same team as your son, Bronny James was the 55th pick and he currently has more turnovers than points. However, if you take the LeBron James course at the School of Nepotism, you'll be aware that LeBron and Bronny James now have the most combined points by a father-son duo in NBA history with 40,582. Brony, who contributed two of these points, is said to be over the moon. Rhys, yes, yeah. That answer is complete rubbish. Which kid is going to get a trial at West Ham by the time he's like eight? You know, you know, well. You know what I'm... That is probably. That's why he wants to go and study. That's what I'm saying. I want my boy to be playing for the best time. And once you've been to the LeBron James School of Nepotism, that can happen. Where are you studying it out of interest? Just do it at the London Stadium. Yeah, still at London Stadium. Yeah, get it nice and focused. All right, let's have a quick check in with the beautifully handwritten scores. No surprises, really. Reese, trailing behind on 19. Felicity, 24. Not bad. Not bad. Nathaniel, 27. Governor, absolutely flying now with those mentions of his 5-year-old son that does exist. 34. 34. I haven't brought my son up once. All right. Here we go. Here we go. All right. Here we go. Here we go. All right. A bit of sensational news that you can imagine caused great excitement in the fighting talk offices. Michael Pepper has been called into the England T20 team for the games against the West Indies alongside Phil Sort. Which means that salt and pepper could open the batting for England. I would like to push it and suggest sports people, that was good, who should also play together simply because of their names. And I will start with Nathaniel. Lovely little dummy over to Reesel. I'm not quite sure he watched NBA. Any watch NBA here? Yeah, I love Bronny James. He's so good. So in March this year, after a game, a player called Anthony Bellack of the Anlando Magic and a Grady Dick of the Toronto Raptors ended up swapping jerseys. But it is their name. So there's a plethora of names that could actually be involved in this. I don't get it. I don't like, don't ask him. Do not ask him to explain this. I'm moving on so quickly here. It should be Steph Curry. Yeah. Yeah. And Grady Dick. No, we got it. We got it. You didn't have to sign together. This is, this is, you've completely lost it, man. Are you trying to, you could go holiday love? You could go Olympic medal and this is how far you've fallen. Yeah. Get giggling about this. Sorry, it's not, if I lose my job for this, we're going to be having words. I thought we were friends. I don't have a job to lose some. This is unbelievable. Okay, well that's an incredibly low bar. He's still giggling. It's not me. No, I mean, yes, he is also giggly, but he wouldn't be giggly if it wasn't for you. Oh, man. All right. Well, I sort of, please go to race. Yes, I think I've, Reese, Reese, please. Low bar. It's the lowest bar. You wait for it. My word. I'm going to son of John David Booty, who is a quarterback in. No, no, no, no. Governor's out of his seat. Who is a quarterback in... No, I'm done, no, goffner's out of his seat! Who is a quarterback in the NFL. Okay, his son is the quarterback of college team Louisiana Monitor Warhawks. His name is General Booty. There's an offensive lineman who currently plays at the Southern Methodist University. I can't bear to listen to this. Called King Large. Now I'm thinking, King Large should get a transfer from the Southern Methodist University, Louisiana Monitor Warhawks, and then you'd have King Large... No, I don't know. I don't want you to say it. Well, look, this is an incredibly childish, childish round, and I wish we'd skipped over it. Governor, can you restore a bit of decency, please? I and I wish we'd skipped over it. Governor, can you restore a bit of decency, please? Yes, I doubt it as well. You know, I've never done this before. Can I just give my points to Reese or nationality? Yeah, yeah, yeah, you can. Another point to, Reese, another point to... I was going to go Max Fried and Declan Rice. Not wrong with a bit of fried rice. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's the kind of thing I was after. You people. Yes, yeah. Do you know, I thought better of it. When I was trying to think of it, I was, there's a tennis plate. Please don't list the ones you didn't go for. Why not? That's what I was going to do. It's Martina Hingis and I was seeing if there was another tennis play with a certain surname of cunning. Anyway, oh my God, oh you don't laugh at that. I've got to, I don't know. I think, I think it, just in case the boss is listening, I'm just going to take a point off myself and not managing this round better. Just so they realise that I know I should have done something differently. There was a family moment that I, this is, this one is clean. Is it? It is. Look at my eyes. I need this to be clean. No, it happened in 2018 on the English cricket team. Stokes, Wokes and Folks all played on the same team. Yes, it was very nice. Lovely. Yes, thank you. Oh, just a lovely little rhyme. No. Look at his, Nathaniel is still pleased with himself. Do you know what? I actually kept it PG. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no. No, no, I can't. Oh my God, he has got a list there. I'm taking more points off for your homework. That finally is the thing that has brought Nathaniel and Reese together. There was a bit of friction and out of like two naughty schoolboys. Nothing like a bit of booty for us. Okay, so I don't know what that's done to the scores. Reese 24. Sully them. Nathan, yeah, the entire show sullied. Nathaniel and Felicity 29. Governor, despite donating points out in the lead on 37. Right, I need to calm down a little bit, I think. A one liner here. And I think all I'm going to say before every answer is, please God, keep it clean. 50 years since the Rumble in the jungle, Ralee versus Foreman in Zaire, and I would recommend that you listen to Power Play, The House of Don King. It's very good. What is your perfect slogan, though, for a modern day sporting event? Felicity. Well, look, I don't know if dressage has been talked about much on this show. Not enough. Not enough. So mine is for dressage. Dressage, when you're rich enough to buy dance lessons for your horse. It's good. Very good. Governor. Violence in the island. No, I said in the island, not on the island. And this is the catchphrase for West Ham Millwall's Stone Island Derby. You've got to love it when the Stone is out. And they've all watched Green Street before and. Nathaniel. I'm going to go for the great old Derby between Bristol Rovers and Shrewsbury Town. The Wheatabix Derby. Do you know why it's called the Wheatabix Derby? Because it's dry. Good. Very good. Bristol Rovers were playing in Shrewsbury and they went down to a pub, stuffed the beers down there, and the landlord said you could bring food into the stadium but not drinks. So one guy that was drunk went down to the co-op, bought 80 pounds worth of wheat of bits, started throwing it on the pitch. So after the game, they started throwing it at the opposing fans and then the horses charged down and they couldn't move any further because they started eating the wheat of it. That's a true story. That's good. I hope we haven't made that up. Quite weird. Reese. The horses were a weird detail. I'm going to Saudi. We're going to have Ronaldo's Al-Nasar in the Saudi Cup final against Namar's Al-Halau, and it's called the Checkbook Championship. Thank you? And I'm also going back to the FA Cup first round. M.K. Don's versus Wimbledon. I'm naming it after one of my favourite films, Stepbrothers. That's nice, actually. That's good. I like that. Yeah, two answers, though. All right, let's have a little look at the... How you count checking you got like 50 points. You couldn't even try... Governors with Ireland. He took five with Reese already. I'm trying to do the scores, Nathaniel. You're losing a point here. Rees has 26. Nathaniel has 31. Felicity has 31. Governor's absolutely walking this. 40. All right. Felicity has 31. Governor's absolutely walking this. 40. All right. A one-worder. I'd like to just spend a bit of time to help Manchester United fans get over their loss by giving the Eric Ten Harge era the fighting talk one-word treatment. Sort of intrigued to know what you'll make of this, actually, Felicity. So we'll go with you first. Unemployed. Yeah, fairly on the nose. Governor. Turkey. Nathaniel? Please. What? Because when he first came to England, at the end of his interviews, opposed to saying thank you, he used to say please. So it's actually like a whole meme. So he would say, good job. He's like, yeah, please. We once, actually, no, I can't tell this story. I'll move on. It hasn't stopped any of us. Yeah, true, actually. This is what he actually said in postgame interviews and what he's doing right now. Processing. Yes. Good answer. It won't be enough. It won't be enough for you, but that is a good answer. All right. Any other business, Nathaniel, feel free to use this won't be enough for your reason. That is a good answer. All right. Any other business? Nathaniel, feel free to use this to apologise to me for your terrible answer. I thought it was pretty creative. It got Governor B hysterical in the crowd going, so I'll leave it on that one. Okay. But. Yeah, they're going to go mad in it. Excuse the producers behind the glass. They were looking up. Absolutely stony face. I actually didn't run that one by them Before Hansen No I got that feeling Yes Yeah yeah yeah There's always that one that you're stuck on right But um I'm gonna go with council tax man It keeps getting higher and higher And I pay so bloody much And my road's not being sweat I don't Yeah no I think so Yeah But it's autumn now, as we've established, and there's so many leaves in front of my house. And I was raking the leaves, only to find out, I had that many leaves in front of my house because my neighbor... This is in front of the new house? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. So much so that because the neighbor was brushing them in front of my house to get them away from his house. And I came back from training one day to see him doing it. And he was like, we'll be gone in five minutes. And I still... That's a joke with all the problems in the world right now. Yeah, but... Listen, all the problems. Yeah, but... I got a big old tree. The guy's sweeping leaves in front of his house. That's out of order. Unbelievable. You are not a working person, my friend. Come on, come on, Rhys. Come on, race. I'm going... Very worthy. Any other business. I'm 30 now. Mm-hmm.ys. I'm going. Very worthy. Any other business? I'm 30 now. Okay. And Governor might not want to hear this. But I believe 30 is the age where you stop going to new music and you only listen to the music that you've always listened to. I go back to the same albums when I was growing up. I haven't listened to Aiton New for 15 years. You also start liking coriander when you're 30. I don't know why that happens. Up until that point's disgusting. Then you're like right. When I was growing up. I haven't listened to Aethan new for 15 years. You also start liking coriander when you're 30. I don't know why that happens. Up until that point's disgusting. Then you're like, oh, that's a tasty spice. Is that your any other business for listening? No, no. Thank you for trying to warm me up. No, I got my British licence only a couple of years ago and I just want to talk about British country roads because when I came over here, I'm like, what are British country roads three or four lanes wide? And they're like, no, it's the width of a Nissan micro. That's right. I'm like, well, surely it's very straight then. If that's narrow, they're like, no, it's hair pin bend after hair pin bend. Tractors, horses, all set in the headways. That's the way we do it. That's right. And so when I thought, I heard that, I'm like, wow, it must take so long to get anywhere because surely under those circumstances, the speed limits, what, 10, 20 miles? It's 60, it's 60. And if you see someone going 60, you're like, why are they going so slow? Exactly, exactly. So furious about that. Furious about that. Unforeseen circumstances. That statement has never been an acceptable explanation. You know, what's the real reason? We deserve more. Took the family to Legoland the other day. Wasn't cheap. And the main water ride was closed due to unforeseen circumstances. Well, no, actually, Legoland. Can you give me the real reason? Because my son's crying. My daughter's kicking off. There we go. Now, can I explain what just happened there? My screen went black. I tried to restart it. And unfortunately, I've ended up hitting the boring sound effect. It's actually quite interesting. Carry on. I think the computer was bored. Yeah. I just think we need, you know, better excuses better excuses and I understand because it's really embarrassing sometimes. I once cancelled a tour once due to unforeseen circumstances. Go on. What was the circumstance? Yeah, exactly. My mum was the only one that I bought a ticket. But we can all be honest, right? Stop being honest, guys. All right, let's have a look at the final scores then. They are. That is incredible. Reese, you have not finished last. No. Nathaniel, you've had a shocking back nine, mate. And I think you know where you lost a lot of your points. 30. Reese on 32, still not making the final. Felicity Ward, magnificent debut in second 34. Astonishing. It is astonishing. I'm trying to count it all up again. And Governor, way debut in second 34. Astonishing. It is astonishing. I'm trying to count it all up again. And Govnett way out ahead on 44. So Felicity and Govna go into the head-to-head, defending and defensible. So this is a ridiculous statement. You have to answer this however much. Look how I'm upset Nathan Neal. If I say I, I mean you. You finished miles out ahead, Governor, so you have 20 seconds on this. If I have my time again, I'd support a proper London club like Chelsea or Spurs. The thing about Chelsea, and especially during Black History Month, I think it's incredible that some of their fans refuse to let black people on trains. And as a black person, West Ham fan, I'd like to experience what it's like to support another football team. Obviously, they've had a few managers over the years. They've got a squad of about 52 players. The gyms are getting smaller. The facilities are getting smaller. And I just think I'd like to experience it. I wasn't entirely convinced by that, Governor. Okay, Felicity, you have 20 seconds on the following. Given that I live in the UK, I will be supporting England at the next Ashes series. Given, oh, I can barely say this. Given that I live in the UK, I will be supporting England in the next Ashes. And what I mean by that is I will be wearing England kit, but when I get inside Lords, I will strip down in the middle of the England section and I will scream for Australia and I will watch us destroy you. No, no, no, no, no. I couldn't do it. I mean, I'll be honest, that is, well, I heard that you couldn't do it. Come on. That is two quite poor defending and defensible's. I'm wondering if, yeah, I'm sort of wondering. I mean, we haven't, we're already overrunning. So I can't give it to either of you? I don't, I mean, do you know that I've got a five-year-old son? Ah, now then, Felicity Ward is the winner. I'm Garif Safke. I've lost every single one of it. And third Australian winner, you should really have won that. You gave it away. I mean, her defending, indefensible was indefensibly bad. And you still lost. I didn't defend it. Couldn't name a Premier League manager. Couldn't name an Italian footballer has one fighting talk. Thank you. Make of that what you will. I think that's on your head be it, man. Yeah, it does feel like it, doesn't it? Thanks very much for listening. This has been a World's End production for BBC Radio 5 Live. The podcast Extra is about to happen and we'll be ranking in, I guess, dishonor of Eric Ten Haug, the Premier League's greatest managerial flops. I'm Rosackins. And I'm Neulam McGovern. And as America chooses its next president, join us for an eventful election night, live from Washington. The urgency of this moment is clear. The most important day in the history of this country. America decides. Throughout this Tuesday night from 10. And on Wednesday, we'll bring you the results and the reaction on 5 Live Breakfast. I created one of the greatest economies in the history of our country. Let's not go back. It's time to turn the page. The US presidential election on Five Live and BBC Sounds. Hello, you're listening to the podcast Extra of Fighting Talk. Rees has just gone out, well, allegedly for a toilet break, but I think Prode go and reflect on what was an extremely poor outing from him. Neff, I was disappointed that you didn't make the final because I did like your defending indefensible. Do you want to have a go at it anyway? Am I getting 20 seconds or want I going to do it? I'll give you the 20 seconds. Yeah, I can disappointed that you didn't make the final because I did like your defending and defence. Do you want to have a go at it anyway? Am I getting 20 seconds or what I'm going to do it? I'll give you the 20 seconds. Yeah, I can do that. Do you want the, I'll give you the Rocky team as well, so it feels proper. So I told me, I'm actually won this one. And then if you'd won, then I want to see the celebrations you were going to do, okay? Let's go for this. Okay, so you have 20 seconds for nothing, actually, on this. Everyone knows that running 9.99 for the 100 metres, my PB, coincidentally, shouldn't really count as breaking 10 seconds. Especially when you've only done it once. I mean, I like to call myself saying I've gone sub 10, but when you've done it once, does it really matter? So you've got to do it three times through it to truly mean something, and quite frankly, it was a bit of a tell win. It was run while I was in college in the States. Who knows what was going on? So it's nice to say, but I don't really believe it myself, to be honest. See, that would have won it for you. That was good. That was good. And I do it on again? The course was a little bit short. You're not doing yours, I think of that. Do you want to do yours? What are we on? I'm just going to give me 20 seconds on your defending and defensible. Don't have we go? You might as well. You're never going to get into it for on your defending and defensible. You'll never go as well. You're never going to get into it for real, so he might as well do it. Here we go. 20 seconds, Rhys, on the following. The FA Cup is devalued by allowing amateur teams to play against professional footballers. Oh, that's 100% facts. It should just be the Premier League's own cup. In fact, let's not even do that. Let's include the best European teams from around Europe to the Premier League's own Cup. In fact, let's not even do that. Let's include the best European teams from around Europe to be included into the FA Cup. So let's have Barcelona versus Aston Villa in the FA Cup final for 2025. I'm all in. Honestly, I'm so disappointed that it wasn't you two, because Nathaniel and Reese have just done two really good defending and defensible there. Governors was all over the place. You panicked. Felicity was with respect for Lillicty. A disgrace. It was a disgrace. I stand by it. You couldn't do it. I couldn't do it, mate. But you have to do it. But I didn't and I still won. So that sounds like a lie. By default. By default. All right. We're going to do the fighting talk rankings now. So we've got five rankers, one each. As we say, a very fond farewell to Eric Tenhaar. Gen right, we're going to do the Fighting Talk rankings now. So we've got five rankers, one each. As we say, a very fond farewell to Eric Tenhaar. Genuinely, I'm going to miss him in his wonderful process. He has inspired this week's rankings, which are the top five biggest Premier League managerial flops. So once again, I think we're going to get your Googling out of the way for list. Yeah, start here. Look, we could talk about managers from football, sure. Or we could talk about what we're doing. It is, yeah, it is what we're doing. Yeah. But what I'd like to say is I would say the biggest flop would be from my manager for putting me on this show. Yes, okay, yeah. Can we get the name of your manager? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I've got a couple. Holly Edden. Holly Ebden. Holly Abden? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I've got a couple. And I'm not, I'm not, Holly, Edden. Holly, Abden. Holly, I know about cricket and I know about many other sports. I do not know about football. And yet here I am winning the show. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's a shame for you and it's a shame for us. Yeah, falling upwards, I think is what we call that. Holly, Evden. I wasn't expecting that as an answer. And there we go. Holly Edden. Reese. Currently managing in the great country ofden. I wasn't expecting that as an answer. And there we go. Holly Eddyn. Ries. Currently managing in the Great Country of Georgia. I'm going with Steve Kean when he was in charge of Blackburn Rovers in 2010 to 2012. Win percentage of 28% of the games that he played. But the best press conferences, I swear he went on like a 17 game losing streak. And every press conference was just... Just a man who knew things were going badly. Listen, we lost due to unforeseen circumstances. Nathaniel. I'm going to go with Frank DeBoer of Crystal Palace. I mean, there seems to be a trend here. Dutch managers who have success in the Ereve Dizzy and come to the Premier League. Did I say that right, by the way? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm pretty proud of myself. And come to the Premier League have the most shocking record. We can go Eric Tenhaug. We can go Frank De Boer. And I just think it's them too top of my head. So, yeah. Absolutely shocking. That's a pattern. I was wondering where. Arnie Slott is helping you there. Indisputable, I think we'd call that. Indisputable. Governor. Claudio Ranieri. Interesting. His time at Fulham, just before he got sacked, he won three out of 17 games, which further emphasises the fact that he only won the league with Leicester because everyone else was rubbish that season. Yeah, I mean, I think it's, there is some truth to that, I think, but it does feel harsh to put him in a list of the worst managerial flops when he won the Premier League. Let's just say he was a flop at Fuller, but otherwise. Yeah, yeah, yeah, all right. I'm going to go for, and I know you'll agree with me on this. Obviously. Mick McCarthy. Yeah, I was going to say that, actually. That was my second choice. Sunderland lost his first 14 games as a top player manager. I mean, I dread to think what Steve Keeney would be saying about that. They score four goals in 14 games that they lost. Dismal, also worth saying that in his time in charge of Sunderland and Wolves in the Premier League, his average points per game, 0.79. That is pathetic. That's hard to do. Quick bit of maths. 38 games. That'll give you a princely 30 points, which isn't keeping anyone up. Not Premier League class. Didn't he do not too bad at wolves? He kept them up twice and then got relegated yes exactly and then got relegated but if you look at the no I think the man's a clown that's why I'm putting in Felicity just as a bit of plugging really is the office on the Australian office on now it's on now it's on prime video. Are people enjoying it? We went top 10 in 105 countries. Wow. So that's a pretty, that's a pretty resounding yes. We went top, number one in four countries. We went top three in 35 countries and we went top five in 67. You're not going to be back on a show, are you? No, she's not. I won't, but that's an elaborate, yes. It's got nothing to do with the office. It's that I'm terrible like the show. You won the show. I did with the show. Wait, that's on you. Yeah, cool. Did you do, eh, eh, eh, eh. There's no copying. I am my own boss. But there is plenty of dancing. Don't worry. I dance to Nellie's hot in here. There is a, I don't know if I can, Slut Drop, can I say that one? Well, yeah, I think so. It's said now. On the podcast extra. Podcast, yeah, yeah. It's, I do a slut drop in a pair of poorly fitting pyjamas. Lovely stuff. Breatthable? Breatthable? Absolutely not. I'm talking 100% polyester. And did you, I mean, this is sort of a serious question, actually. It's quite a lot of pressure on taking on that role. Yeah. Did you brick it? Yeah. I mean, not while I was filming. While I was filming, it was fine. You just stay off the internet. That's all I do. Yes, okay. It's been on, it's been on for two weeks now, and I can read all comments on Instagram now. I blocked, I didn't block them. I just didn't read them for the first couple of weeks. Are people liking it? Are people being nice? Yeah, I mean, my friends't block them, I just didn't read them for the first couple of weeks. And are people liking it? Are people being nice? Yeah, I mean, my friends. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You'd hope so. No, lots of people being nice. But then, like, someone told me that like a bunch of in cells flooded IMDB with one stars. Like, there was like a campaign. Yes, because in this fictitious show, it should be a male boss, Felicity. There should only be one. Actually, there should only be two. But they're allowed to be men. Yes, exactly. Yeah, people are pretty angry. But look, I've watched this show now a couple of times through. And I think it's really funny. I really think it's funny. And I would watch it. So if people don't like it, that's okay as well. Like, it's just not your cup of tea. But for people who like, who hate it or think it's awful, that's just not true. It's like it's comedy. So some people like my stand up. Some people don't like my stand up. That's good. But it doesn't mean that it's not good. I think it sounds excellent. I mean, I won't watch it because, of course, that character should be a man. But obviously. It does. Thank you. Finally. You know, I felt uncomfortable playing it. I'm like, you know what? Surely there's a man that could do a better job than me. That is, oh no, let's do our top five. I can never find the music. There it is. So in no particular order, our top five Premier League managerial disasters, starting with, quite weirdly, Holly Ebton, who is not a Premier League manager, but she is Felicity's manager and she's done a bad job, even though her client won the show. Then we've got Steve Keene, more respectable answer for his miserable win percentage at Blackburn and his terrible press conferences. Frank DeBoer at Palace, one of literally two bad Dutch managers that Nathaniel could think of who'd done well in the Aero da Visi. It was the Aero da Visi, wasn't it? You said it not me. Thank you very much. Claudia Ranieri for his time at Fulham, which, as I said, it was extremely harsh given he won the Premier League, and Mick McCarthy for being rubbish at both Sunderland and Wolves. That is your lot for this week. Thanks very much, everyone. BBC Sounds, music, radio, podcasts."}
