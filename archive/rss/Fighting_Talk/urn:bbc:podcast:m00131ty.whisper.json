This podcast is supported by advertising outside the UK. BBC Sounds, music, radio, podcasts. Hello, everybody. Remember, alcohol does not cause hangovers. It's the waking up that does it. I'm Colin Murray. This is Fighting Talk. fighting talk. A happy new year to everybody brave enough to be up and listening this morning on January the first, 2020. And for the third year running, we simply say, this year can't be as bad as last year, can it. Can it? Can it! Now, let me make one thing clear. This is not a live fighting talk in reality. We're recording this show so far in advance of Phil Brown still manager of Hull City. I mean, I just hope we're still on the Kent variant by the time this airs. Let's meet the first four people to appear on fighting talk in the year 2020. Well first up hasn't bothered to even return our calls since he landed the co-hosting job and the Five Live Breakfast show. That's not a complaint. I wouldn't return this show's calls if I got weekend breakfast. Rick Edwards is here. How you meet? You all right? Hello, mate. How you doing? You're right. Yes, good. Sterling job you're doing as well. I really enjoy listening to in the mornings. I do. And, you know, whatever happens after this six-month period, I know it's a short contract. Whatever happens, I think you've been very, very good. He's made it to 2022. Well, you don't know. We don't know that. That's the thing. We genuinely don't know that. At this moment, he's only done four shows. And let's say the reviews weren't great. Downhill. Downhill is what they're saying. Next up, so amazing to have her back on for the first time. And absolutely, it's again, another presenter who found better employment and all of a sudden stop checking her WhatsApp. She's a Chelmsford Legends. No, no, no, no, no. Can we not play this? Carlyne Barca. Well, 2021 made this song uncool, didn't it? Yeah, you're right. Let's stop. Can we not play this? Caroline Barker. Well... The 2021 made this song uncool, didn't it? Yeah, you're right. Let's stop. Let's get your new theme tune for this year. You're right. Okay. What about theme tune to porridge for the Barker? Yes. Would that work? It would because, of course, setting jumps of prison. Oh, there you go. That's the quickest we've ever sorted out, didn't you? New theme tune. Also works because in your teenage years, which you haven't covered yet. You did some bird, didn't you? You did about six months. I did. Yeah, I did. We'll find out about that later. For armed robbery. So that works really well indeed. Right. Also on today's show, wow. I genuinely filed him under comedians now too big to appear on fighting talk alongside the bishops and Oliver's of this world. Here he is. It's a huge, fr fruice newest yahr to the german khan pats of course to the uk yeah was i even close set yeah very good force noise yeah there you go henny means here mate yeah likewise likewise not very of you. Finally, someone once described as an Uber manager, although these days more often described as an Uber driver. I'd give him five stars. As he does what he can to make ends meet in between jobs. No doubt be back in a dugout by January 7th. It's Phil Brown. How you, mate? You all right? Good morning. I didn't think I was going to send New Year's deal with you, Colin. Dear me, I gave up a couple of drinks last night for you. Lovely. I love you pretending it's live. Fantastic work. Even over I said, it's pre-rect. Right, before we look ahead to the sporting year 2022, let's put a cap on 21. We haven't got time to review all 526,600 minutes of it, but please give me the best one minute of sport in 2021. Rick Edwards. Yeah, so usually I like a bit of needle in sport, love a bit of agro, bit of afters, and this totally goes against that. And Colin, I'm going to warn you, you're going to hate this, you miserable old commogeant, but nevertheless. The best minute of sport without question was on the evening of Sunday the 1st of August, the culmination of the best high jump competition in history when the two great rivals, great friends, Barsham and Tambury embraced having agreed to share the gold medal. Don't stop that. Both don't stop it. Both having beautiful scorecards, both having crucially jumped extremely high, perfect heartwarming combination of elite performers to stop it and generosity. And one of the few moments when you go, yeah, that's what people mean when they talk about Olympic spirit. And I don't care how many points you take off me for saying that, Colin. It's not sport, though. What do you mean it's not sports? Training for four years to share. No, you share food. They jump two meters 37. Can you jump that? You share a bottle of wine. I hope you should enter. Caroline, you share food. They jump two metres 37. Can you jump that? You share a bottle of wine. I'm fair to you should enter. Caroline, you share a bottle of wine. You share a dessert. You don't share an Olympic gold medal. How would you know, Colin? You've never got anywhere near a gold medal. Listen, nobody does that. Imagine if you're watching the FA Cup final, right? It was one all, right? And it was here we go. It's the last minute and they picked the ball up. Because you're sure that. It's a special moment as it doesn't normally happen. Yeah, it doesn't matter. There's a reason why it doesn't happen. It's the reason why there's a gold, a silver and uproids. I do. Oh, actually, actually, does it mean we wouldn't have lost Italy on penalties? There we go. Yeah, but you wouldn't have won anything. You would have shared it. I've changed my mind. And there's no travel between Italy and England, so that wouldn't have worked. Caroline, what's your answer? Well, I've got plenty of Barnett supporting friends who would tell you around about 9.46 on January the 19th, 2021, when the decision to suspend relegation to the national south of the season was celebrated by then. But I am going to go for football, though. Back in December 2020, I know wrong year, when fans were initially let back in and there was all that emotion. Do you remember them saying, oh, we've got this moment to come back briefly, briefly? And it's going to be different. This time round, we're not going to boo our team. This season, my lot, Chelmson City, we're playing Maidstone United at the Gulaug, which is it's given Monica to try and make the running track and the bouncy sand pits sound more intimidating. So we're there. My dad was greeting all his old mates with You Survive 2 then, and a hearty chuckle that they'd made it through. And they're all saying the same thing. This time will appreciate what we've got. No doom, no gloom. Then about 415 on the 21st of August, and I have Googled this bit, 335,055 minutes into 2021 we conceded a goal and it was like we would never been away his mate turned through and says we're going down that's it another waste of a season within minutes within minutes of the season starting that was it, it was done the reality struck Henning best minute June 29th I was there Wembley Stadium, England, Germany. And the moment from when the German players walked out, got booed constantly. Then the National Anthem got booed. And there was essentially 60,000 people there who gave it two fingers to political correctness and just enjoyed football for what it is. And then, I mean, if you can't boo the Germans at Wembley, then what's the point of football? Phil Brian. Well, I don't know about you, Colin, but I've never been in a boxing ring. I don't know if any of my core contestants have been in a boxing ring. It's the most scariest place on earth. And in the 11th round for one minute, can you just imagine being Deonti Wilder? He's sitting there in the 10th round. He's being battered from Pillett to Post and he's got one minute to try and recover. The white towel's gone in the fight beforehand, so he can't throw that. That option's not available. And he has to go back into the ring for the 11th round and he gets knocked all over the place one minute of absolute brilliance by Tyson Fury beautiful the best minute of sport in 2021 and this is new year's day on five life 22 and we go to question two it's from you one of our listeners to fighting talk this is pre-recorded um so it's a pre-record within a pre-record. That's how much effort we've put in to work on New Year's Day. It's Catherine from Birmingham. Let's have a listen. Hi folks. Happy New Year. It's Catherine here. I hope you've all had a Merry Christmas. I've listened to the show for years. I'm a big fan and I actually can't believe I'm finally going to get the chance to ask a fighting talk question. Oh, so here goes. My hometown of Birmingham will host the Commonwealth Games this year. Very exciting. Let's be honest, we weren't the first choice. It was Durban in South Africa. But anyway, that's another story. So what I want to know is, what are the other occasions when you've thought, I can't believe it's being held there? I can't believe it's being held there. Thank you very much, Catherine, in Birmingham. Phil Brown. I think the simple one for me would be the Football World Cup in Qatar. You know, we're talking about, on a serious point, you know, 50 odd degrees. And we've raised the level of football to a great standard. And now all of us, and everybody's expecting to play on the world stage, 53 degrees average temperature. It's just ridiculous. You'd be all right there, wouldn't you? Oh, not sure. A bit of sun tan lotion, get me there. But I've got a strange one. Honestine Slate Mine. Have you ever heard of that? Honestor Slate Mine. Slate Mine. Yeah, I Googled it too. Unbelievable. This one, 2,000 feet too. Unbelievable, this one. 2,000 feet below the level of the ground, they had a cricket batch, and I know the ashes is on at the moment. It's that below sea level. 2,000 below the ground. They drug a hole, and they went down this, there's 11 mile underground, and they had a game of cricket on 2013, on 50 December, to try and raise some money. So one of the weirdest places would be Honester. Very strange indeed, Henning? Well, I've stopped saying I can't believe it's being played there because, I mean, these days I believe absolutely everything. So it started really World Cup 94 in the US. That was the first time I said, I can't believe it's being held there. And since then, I just take it all in my flow. I mean, the Spanish community shield was played in Saudi Arabia. Yeah, take that for granted. Then have the Winter Olympics in Sochi, 53 degrees again. So, and yeah, American football in London. Yeah. What's that all about? Yeah, yeah. You're right. You just kind of take it for granted, you know, it's like, you know, you get, you know, boxers having their homecoming fights in Doha. Money talks, Colin, you know that? You're right there. Caroline, what is the, when you said, why are they holding it there? When they're going to host the archery and the shooting for the Commonwealth Games in India until it was cancelled for COVID? There were the Birmingham game, so that was pretty odd. But my humble... Where's the next Olympics being held? Well, yes, but... Because the next Olympics is Paris, right? Yeah, and then LA. Surfing is being held in Honolulu. Yeah. Yeah. Madness. Right? I'm thinking if you can't do the surfing, you can't have the Olympics. Right? It's sad. I don't have like one of those council estate wave surfing, you can't have the Olympics. Right? It's sad. So, do not have like one of those council estate wave pools that we used to have growing up? Get down the out and get down Avenue, Leisure Center into the weekend. True story. True story. One of those wave pools, when someone did something that they shouldn't in the wave pool. Yeah. And don't be on the end of the wave when that happens. No. Let me just tell you that. Awful. Awful. My humble brag, obviously, I've been lucky enough to see sport in some brilliant places. I thought I'd peaked playing one touch football with a toilet roll and Lionel Blair, who just had his eyes lasered in a posh unisex losing London. But it wasn't that. I actually ended up in San Quentin prison. So actually what you said earlier was quite true, Colin. It's in California. For those that don't know, it's the only prison with death row in the state, one of the oldest prisons too. I think Charles Manson was held there and labelled as one of the most notorious in the US. And we were visiting there went in one of the cells, a guy who was on death row, awful, awful situation for some of those that are in there and wrongly accused. But why we play sport, there's got an amazing tennis court right in the middle of the yard. It was a baking hot day. There's huge walls towering over you. And those normally high tennis court fences are lowered. So they don't stop the balls going out, but they are actually low enough. So the bullets from the guards in the watch tower who are over the fence if there's trouble can get you. It's amazing. It's a neutral zone. It's where racial divides don't exist. There's no gang affiliation on the court. And these are lifers and I play tennis with them. Incredible story. Rick Edwards. Oh, quite simple one actually. First leg of the quarterfinal of the Champions League last year. Liverpool, away at Rail Madrid. Not at the Burnabout oh no at their training pitch the Estadio Alfredo de Stefano now I know there were no crowds in anywhere at that point and I know they were upgrading their stadium but God God they'd not have found somewhere better than that to play they might as well have marked out the goals with little cones it was absolute travesty and yes and do entirely blame the pitch for the result well Catherine in Birmingham was a pre-recorded question so obviously wouldn't be able to award the bonus points unless we asked her just a guess and pre-recorded proven that this is the most corrupt show in all of radio. So here is Catherine from Birmingham's pre-recorded bonus points awardment. To be honest guys I couldn't even be bothered to stick around and listen to your answers because the points were always going to go to my favourite football presenter, Caroline, unlucky lads. What a surprise. I'm literally mates for Catherine. That makes me merry. Right, next topic is all about this. Championship point number three. Serve up. It's an ace. She's done it with an ace. She's down on the floor. Emma Radicano is the US Open champion at the age of 18. Obviously, as a keen follower of the Bromley and District Junior Tennis Circuit, I was aware of Emma Radacano's prospects, but most of the country part-timers never heard of her before she burst onto the scene. Following up, of course, a stellar debut at Wimbledon with a US open title. So who's the next sportsperson we've not heard of as yet, but it'll be a household name by this time next year. And the New Year's Day pre-record in 2023, Caroline Barker. Because the winters are on the way, there's bound to be some T-T-Tray slider from the home counties. However, I'm going to go for the Euros, women's Euros, Frank Kirby and Lauren Hemp are already and should already be household names, but they are going to go stratospheric come the end of the Euros when England lift that trophy. Now, the question is which Northern Ireland player will score the winner against England at those Euros at St Mary's, and that'll be the one we shall see. Rick Edwards. Well, I think this was going to be his breakthrough season and clearly some of us have heard of him already. But because he got that nasty injury back in September, I think he's been off people's radar. Harvey Elliott, the boy is a little genius wizard. And if fingers crossed he comes back strong I honestly think he's in with a shout of making the World Cup squad for England at the end of the year he is that good also about six months ago I saw him out shopping in Manchester and was totally starstruck I sort of followed him around for a little bit but as a middle-aged man getting starstruck by a 17 year old boy it's unsettling yeah it's definitely is very unsettling Don't follow around 17-year-olds in shopping centres. A bit of career advice. It's a bit too late for that now. I've done it. And now I've spoken about it. I don't think they give me any points for that because the question clearly says, who's the sports person we've not heard of as yet? You've went for Harvey, Elliot. Oh, so, but you're're allowing Fran Kirby who scored a goal in the women's FA Cup final. No, no, she didn't get many points either. Caroline, I'm still waiting a good answer in this round. Don't you worry? Did I get one for Lauren Hemp, though? Don't you worry, Ricky boy, you got one more point than Rick, but that's not really saying anything. No, no, I'm not a good day. Still waiting a good answer. Henning, have you got it? I think so. I think so. I asked my friend, she's really into tennis because I wanted to stay with tennis and then I said to her, who do you reckon will be the number one in women's tennis at the end of the year? And then she said, Ashley Barty. That's the one. But then I googled her. Transpired. She's the world number one already. And then I went through the top ten. I've never heard of any of them. So for you. With the Williams Williams says apparently I'm playing anymore Steffin Rath retired all right no good answers Phil this is a rare occasion where you could get the highest score in a round well I knew Henning was coming on the show so I decided to go for a German bone a German born and he's a jockey one of my favourite sports is horse raisin. Torhamer Hansen, I don't know if you ever heard of him. He is good, yeah, yeah, yeah. He came to my attention in the Cambridgeshire. He actually tried to steal the Cambridges, which is a handicap. Don't get me wrong, some of the handicaps have been ducked and they're not real handicaps, and Frankie was on something that was too stone out the handicap and he rightly so won the race. But this kid stole a charge. He tried to get four, five, six length out the field at the two furlong pole, which he did and he only got caught on the lane. So he came second. But he's already got, I think, 24, 25 winners, 64, 65 teams in the place. So Torhammer Hansen, leading jockey next year. Good old German name. Yeah. Tor hammer. Given that I sort of didn't understand a word of that after the word horse, I'm assuming that's a really good answer, so I'll give you loads of points. So let's do the scores. He can't even blame it to Hangover because we pre-recorded this in the evening, but Rick's only got nine points after three questions. Hennings Cup 14 and Caroline Barker and Phil Brown at the moment are tied on 15 on this New Year's Day finding song Right, a couple of quickies to fit in Daniel Craig is confirmed Of course this will be his last James Bond film playing at 007 So that is done But who in sports should do a Daniel Craig in 2022? So I suppose I'm asking, who should call it a day? Phil Brown. I'm going to surprise you with this one. Novak Djokovic. He's on the verge of 21 grand slams in the Australian Open. And all I'm getting from him is anti-vax, anti-vax, anti-vax, I think he just needs to put it down, smash the Australian Open and then retire. Caroline Barker. Jake Paul should definitely do a Daniel Craig. I'm not sure though he will go out with a bang against Tommy Fury. However, I have an alternative. Oh, we're allowed? Oh, hallelujah already. It wasn't even your main answer. Likening to Daniel Craig then, someone swath, sophisticated, wears a suit perfectly, often seen as a secret agent by the opposition. He's not 007, but 1,602 and his name is often reversioned into something I can't repeat. It's got to be Neil Warmer, right? There go, answer. Good answer. Good answer. Brilliant. Caroline's your honour class there. Rick Edwards, time to catch you. Yeah, I probably won't actually. Also, I'm just chuckling at the idea that Djokovic retired so he can go full-time anti-fax. You really put the timing. I'd like to concentrate on Facebook posts. Okay, so bear with me here. Ronaldo, I honestly think. Just call it quits at the end of the season. I don't like the guy. He's a weirdo. But there is no denying he's been an unbelievable footballer. And I'm into the idea of him quitting while he's still operating close to his peak. So few players do it. He could legitimately stop in the summer, say he was exceptional throughout his career. No dips. All-time record goal scorer. That's the way to go out. No one wants to see a 39-year-old Ronaldo benchwarming at Everton. Yeah, would you want another move? Yeah. Well, you wouldn't want another move if you're an Aldi, you can't want another move. You've went back to your old club. This is your last place. He's the best player. They've got, by far. He hasn't took Germany yet. Yeah, yeah. He's welcome. He's welcome at Schalker. Yeah. That's what I don't want to see. But I suppose it'll depend whether they qualify for the World Cup or not. You know, that'll make a huge difference if they get through a playoff. That could be a good time. But I'm back in you here. I'm back in you here. Thank you. I mean, that's the same for Messi. If Messi or Ronaldo won the World Cup would be a good time for them to end the career. Yeah. But neither will. Yeah. Why? Who will? I'll tell you later. I'm looking forward to that. What's your answer for this round then? Who should packet in with Sergio Aguero? Now with his heart condition. I think they might be tempted because it was such a great footballer to say, how everything's all right. Again, I'll give it a comeback. And it's probably not worse the risk. Just call it a day and collect stamps or something. Okay. What bizarre. Fizarre. Fizarre answer. Right, let's do the head-to-head. Then we What bizarre. Fizarre. Fizarre answer. Right, let's do the head-to-head and we'll break for your New Year's Day, news and sport, and then we will be back the second half of fighting talk, but it's time to go head to head. Three points for the winner and zelts for the loser. Let's just play our fake sound effect. It makes you believe that we actually have a machine we draw the sound of. And it's brown against Henning Vane. And it's the brown hen derby. Wonderful. Wow. Right. It's time to crown fighting talks sports man of the year. Go. I'm going to go for Mike Ashley. Mike Ashley to the credit of Newcastle United, he's decided to sell the football club, made a huge profit, got rid of 10 managers on route, finished twice in the bottom three, got relegated, got promoted twice, finished fifth once. Should have sold the club 10 years ago and got rid of all them wonderful Newcastle fans and never going to get rid of them. You can't name a man of the year better than Mike Ashley. Go ahead, honey. Good point, good point. For me, it's Mesud the year better make Ashley. Go ahead, honey. Yeah, good point. Good point. Yeah, for me, it's Mesud. Mesud Ursille. What a four or five years. First of all in 2018, annoyed the whole of Germany by telling everyone's races. So that didn't go down too well. He didn't quite do that, but yes. Yeah, he did. Yeah, in no uncertain terms. And then at Arsenal, he sits on the bench, and so nothing happens. Then he gets his big money move back to his home, to Fenerbache, and now the chairman says he really should try and focus on his football a bit more. So can you imagine how much they must have already torn their hair out? Because, I mean, the chairman of Fennabatchezer say he should focus a bit more on football, a bit less playing Fortnite, maybe. I'm only surprised that Mike Ashley didn't sign him. Remember, it's the Fighting Talk Sportsman of the Year, hence the answers you've just got. I'll give the bonus points to Henning just over. Oh, come on, Colin. I can't even ingest to give it to Mike Ashley, not even ingest. At least, Barker against Edwards, it's the Carrick Darby and you two have got Fighting Talk Sportswoman of the year. Go. I am going to go, as already pointed out, by Rick, that Chelsea, Frank Kirby, Panilla Harder, brilliant, brilliant women. Amazing, fantastic. So I'm going to celebrate all that's great about the FA. Chelsea got 25,000 pounds for winning the Women's FAA Cup. The winner of the men's FAA Cup gets £1.8 million. In the first round proper, the women's teams get £850.000. The men get $22,000. The argument against it is you can't pay them what they don't earn. So saying the revenue they bring in, the sponsorship, the eyeballs. What a load of bunkum. There's a sound argument for investment in the growth sector and I think what they've shown on Sky and the BBC is women's football is growing rapidly. So well done, the FA. Well done on paying them just 25,000 pounds. Who's your sports women's more? Chelsea's women's more to take part in the end up than time. I'm quits in here. I'm quitting in here because I've gone for a woman and not an organisation. Yeah, that might get you the points, Rick. Here we go, I'm in, I'm in. So Australian can do is Jess thoughts. Are you saying that women can't run the FA? I'm saying that you can't say that the woman of the year is the FAA. Yeah, exactly. The woman of the year cannot be the FAA. Who ever Rick said, gets the points. So we're saying that the FAA has to be male then? No, you said the FAA. It's ungendered. Yet again, you've taken the question. You've taken the question and given your own answer to it. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't barker. I don't even need to explain who the Australian canoe is Jess Fox is. No, and I think it's almost better to just leave that hanging in the air. You just remember the woman, simple ass. Tell us all about them, Rick. Don't need to. I want to know. All right, fine. She's the lady who won, she won a bronze and a silver at the Olympics, but she's winning woman of the year because she's the one that sustained damage to the tip of her kayak and then proceed to repair it using one of the condoms issued to all the athletes at the games. And it's on Instagram and it takes you straight back to sex ed in schools. You swap the banana for a canoe, just easing the condom over. What school did you go to that they used the canoe? Remarkable that that gets the point, but it does. It is remarkable, isn't it? For some reason, it's quite tight, actually. Rick, you'd managed to prove things back because you got your three bonus points. You were the highest score in the question before that. So 23, you're on now. Phil Brown sits in third place with 24, but is Caroline and Henning leading the way 26 points each on this New Year's Day fine talk. I've run the clockdown now. Let's get the news of sport. Welcome back to this fighting talk, New Year's Day special. A reminder to everybody listening, this is pre-recorded, so do not text in. Not that you ever text in, because we don't have any text subjects on the show. But don't text in, if you were randomly going to text in to abuse either Rick Edwards, Caroline Barker, Henning Vane and Phil Brown and God knows they give you many reasons in the first half to do so. Let's get on with the second half of Fighting Talk and we start with the game changer and with three points between first and last. Rick, Rick Edwards, this is your moment. You can get yourself in front in one question. Fantastic. And it has been one of the best changes in Fighting Talk, the game change around. It really does make a difference. Five bonus points yourself in front in one question. Fantastic. And it's been one of the best changes in fighting talk. The game change around. It really does make a difference. Five bonus points for one of you. Nothing for the other three. And I want to know, what was the first sporting date in 2022 in your calendar, in your diary? What is your must not miss event in the year ahead? And more importantly, convince me to go with you. Let me try and guess with a theme tune. Let's try and guess answers before you do it. So Phil Brown, I'm going to say, it's got to be horse racing, is it? No, it's not. Believe it or not, it's the Ali Pally. I'd love to take you to the dark. I'd take you to the dark. Exactly. You can get the tickets. My mate reached the semi-final last year. It was just an absolute thrill. It was wonderful. It is great. It is wonderful. There was another venue I was going to take you to though. Am I allowed to say it? Yeah, go ahead. Barrow against Bradford, New Year's Day. Yeah, take me to the darts. Oh. Yeah, easier to get to them, Barrow. Uh, Caroline, I'm going to go with. It's going to be some proper grassroots type of football I think complete opposite to grassroots football go ahead where are we going on the 15th of July 2022 where you should have this tattooed about your body already we're off to Southampton yes Yes. Certain team from Northern Ireland. Yeah. There you go. There you go. All the way to St Mary's to watch the Euros. Northern Ireland, England. Proper rivalry. Great stadium to watch out. I mean, Brighton, Brentford, there are some phenomenal stadiums hosting the football. But that is the day. I've reworded this as well. They've reworded this like, Kenny is our leader and we're coming after you, and this is what we sing. Fill it up with green and white, come on! Do you know what? In all seriousness, the ticket sales for the women's euros, most sold to England in England, second most was Northern Ireland, which is fantastic. So I'm hoping the other two games in the group can make a huge difference that can make a huge difference and Caroline in all honesty right they're tough yeah yeah but last Austria game what was it to all yeah I think you'll do alright against Austria Norway yeah but we're getting better we're getting better and better and better you look at the score lines against England alright comfortable victories but scores going down and down isn isn't it? So you just, listen, you just never know time for heroes. Very excited. I was going to that anyway, though. So I've already got a ticket, Caroline. I don't know where I'll hang out with the English. At that, I'll be on my mates. Can I hang out with you? I think that was the point. I'll be there. My horse tied up outside, Phil. Making it a Cheltenham. Make it a chillem. Not so bad. Right, Rick is going to take me to. Okay, well, there's only one place I'm going to go with Rick, I'm sure. Here we go. Right, Rick, where are you taking me? Well, actually, on the theme of things that you're definitely already going to, and also a place that someone else is taking you, I'm taking you to Ali Pally. Oh no! Not for the darts, for the Snooks! Yes! And genuinely I've got four tickets to the evening session of the Masters on the 14th January, Friday night, I'm sure you'll be there, but if you're not going to be there, genuinely you're very well-to-ta have one. Last year, after the worlds, I resigned from presenting Snooker after nearly 10 years of going to every single master's worlds in UK. Come on down then definitely not be going this year. I was getting paid to go for the last nine years. Rick did you say you've got four tickets here? Yeah come Phil if you take me to the darts Phil yeah Henning's in Caroline. I'm in I'm there. We're in that's a date everybody. I'm in, I'm there. That's a date, everybody. Fantastic. That's quite sad, really, that nobody had taken those tickets yet, Rick. No, they have really. It's just for the show. Oh, you're making promises you can't hold. That's right, heading, yes. Where's Henning taking me? I'm going to guess to Germany. No, it's so difficult to travel at the moment, isn't it? So you can't, you need a visa to go to a pub, so, no, not traveling abroad. They're not too as Henning, are they? Huh? When you heard that? Oh, yeah, there's always a well up. I well up, I give you death. Let's just give it its proper treatment. Ooh! Better now, Henning. Feel better now. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Four World Cups is amazing, isn't it? A big bunch of come, amazing. I'm witty, I'm setting you up. You tap them, haven't it? Now, where we're going, Colin, is, and it's my treat, January the 1st, New Year's Day, you come down to the seaside, come down to Hastings. Hastings United play Lansing, and there's Bostic League South, top of the table, clash. We're closing in. Hastings, the last three seasons, we've had promotion stolen from us because they prematurely ended the season on all occasions. And yeah, so that's, and it's my treat. Yeah. Not too bad, only 12 quits. I was going to say it's hardly expensive. Yeah. Is it really? Yeah. It's not like, you know what I mean? Breakfast. Wimbledon's center court, my treat. Yeah. Not too bad. It's only 12 quits. I was going to say it's hardly expensive. Yeah. Is it really? Yeah. It's not like, you know what I mean? Breakfast. Wimbledon, Centre Court, my treat. That's where you add those words in. Yeah, no, but it's my treat. And I get your pint. Pilotfield, proper stadium. Yeah. Yeah. Pilotfield, fantastic ground, isn't it? War Club. Listen, I have been to most of the grounds that you will mention. Caroline knows this. We've talked many times about the various places. I've went to genuinely just enjoy lower league and non-league football. Where are you going to take me? I don't want you to take me there. I can go there whenever I want and pay on the door. So in a terrible round, Phil Brown gets a bonus points because at least we're going to the darts together. Oh, I like it. Yeah. And Caroline, I ain't hanging out with English that day. There's no way, right. I said I'd hang out with you. So what's wrong with Haines? What type of father are you? What type of England fan are you that you're going to come in with the Northern Ireland fans? Have some respect? Colin will get a bit on your mate for the final. Yeah. You know what I mean? You've got the semi-final last year. He's got to be better now. It's not real, Phil. I'm not really cool. What's wrong with Hastings? There's nothing wrong with Hastings. Have you thought out of off with Snooper? No. More importantly. I just, come on. You'd rather go there on your own than with me. So you could have taken me to the World Series. You could have taken me to the Super Bowl. You're going to take me to the Palio. You're going to take me to the Palio and Sienna. Right. You could have taken me to all of these wonderful places. And you take me to non-league football. We can't leave this island. Whoa, whoa, whoa. I misunderstood the question. I thought it was a genuine offer of tickets that you had. Yeah. Yeah, but you are now saying you're not giving him a way anyway. I can't. No, you didn't. You give him to Caroline. You give him to Helen. You give him to Phil Bryan, which is like literally the worst day out ever. The United Nations is declared 2022 the year of glass. I kid you not. I thought it might have been a metaphor, and then I went to have a look on the website, and it just listed all the uses for glass. So a chance to ask, what's the greatest glass thing in sport? Love this question, actually. Caroline Barker, the greatest glass thing in sport. Immediately thought of the footballer who slipped and injured himself on a glass table, but then couldn't find which footballer it was that slipped and injured himself on the glass table and went down a wormhole of odd injuries and found Rio Ferdinand. I'd forgot that he picked up a tendon strain in his knee watching television when he had his foot up on a coffee table. I'm assuming it was glass. Dave Besson slipped and dropped a glass salad cream bottle. Seven to tend and his tote. It was up for eight weeks, was it? Yeah. Santiago Canisarius, Spain goalkeeper, missed the 2002 World Cup, shattered a bottle of after shave, glass, hotel sink, fell on his foot. And then I found him. It was the Dundee player, Derek Lyle missed the Scottish Cup with Queen of the South when he fell through a glass table. All of those are topped by the best glass thing in sport Jimmy. Ah Jimmy Glass of course. Right good answer kind of good start to the round Henning, Best Glass Thing in Sport. Go be Dennis Taylor Speckles. Hey! No bud, snowboard. No, bud. A loopie. Go be Dennis Taylor, Speckles. Hi. Oh, bad, snobud. No bad, bloat. No, no, he likes a snooper, does he? And him and them and me. We'll show you what we can do with a loud of boards and a snooker cure. You had the words in front of him, Colin. No, job of me, it! In German. In a show full of cynicism and snidiness, that was generally one of the most innocently lovely moments in the history of fighting talk. Let him win. Let him win. No, I don't want to win with all that talk. Let him win, let him win. Why don't you just share it? Yes, thank you. Thank you. Right, very nice. Yeah, and they were made for him. They were especially made for him for him. Yeah. Because when he went down on the shots, it was very normal now, but they were made for him. They were especially made for him. Yeah. Because when he went down on the shot, so it's very normal now, but they were made for him at the time. If you want to know anything about the 1985 World Snooker Final, just approach Dennis Taylor, if you ever see him, and he'll talk about it for three hours, even if you're a perfect stranger. Rick Edwards. So, I was thinking about this, and I was like, I wonder if there's a sports fan with a glass eye that has the logo of their team and so i did a quick search oh my god please tell me there is loads of them yes come on big up bill van den bushes seattle seahawk's eye Andrew canavan's newcastle united eye ryan gibson's biomeunuch eye the list goes on there are some wonderful glass eyes out there. Really? Yeah? Well, and they have that, instead of the eye, they have the team's logo. Yeah. Forget the iris. Forget making it look like an eye. Get the team logo on there. That's it like a fraud machine in it, like seven or something. Right, question for the Fight and Talk podcast Extra. What would you have as the logo on your glass eye? We're not asking Phil Brown his glass. Oh, good call. Right, question for the Fight and Talk podcast Extra. What would you have as the logo Are we not asking Phil Brown is glass? Oh, good call. Yeah, we are. What do you? He's just going to come back to me. Chill out. You're a guest in this show. Sorry. I was just saying. I've just cracked open open media and that'll take you four hours. That's the biggest end joke I've ever heard. Just a good old open media joke. Yeah, I was just saying that we'll talk about that in the podcast section. Giving you notice to think about what you would have as the logo on your glass site. Phil Brown finished the round for. Thank you very much, Rick, for your support. Thank you. No problem, Phil. Looking forward to the snooker. Yeah. I don't know about you guys, but I'm a little bit like Colin. I like these minority sports, you know, the ones that are not the most popular. You sit yourself in front of the TV watching the Olympics and I got drawn to synchronise swimming and diving and the swimming that was going on. I was in the pool most of the time watching this race and some of the dives that were going on. And then I started fascinating over the camera, the lenses that were under the water and they covered everything that was going on underneath the water as well. It was just fabulous. So I was saying the most important thing they were under the water and they covered everything that was going on underneath the water as well. It was just fabulous. So I was saying the most important thing in sport is the glass lens on the camera. That's a lovely answer. In the synchronised swimming. Yeah, I think that's a lovely answer. Are any of the fantastic cameras we get these days? Well... The overshot that you now have, especially in the American football, I think that's where it was champion, but that camera that can follow the play, the bird's eye view is wonderful, you know. You love your sporting. Very good answers. Well, we know who's going first in this question, although we have to wait at the end of the year. One of the highlights of 20-22 for some people will be the men's World Cup. Who's going to win it, and he'll win it for them, Henning? Qatar. They're going to win the World Cup. Oh, Qatar are going to win the World Cup and will be won for them by Tamim bin Hamat Altarni. And he's the ruler of Qatar. He'll make sure they win. Don't you worry about that. So what you're saying is they'll turn the air conditioning off for that game. Whatever they do, somehow they'll keep their trophy. Don't you worry about that? Caroline is winning the World Cup. Surely it's David Beckham winning it for Qatar, isn't he? Seeing it's won for England so many times. Yeah. I'm actually going to say the NHS and JVT, comforting football analogies have come of plenty in the form of England's Deputy Chief Medical Officer, Professor Jonathan Van Tam. If there's a football analogy to be had He will talk about it in relation to COVID So surely, surely he's got some up his sleeve for the World Cup But you always know that there's something serious happening Like a new variant or an increase of hospitalisations Or those serious things that dogg us at the moment Because when the football analogy comes out from either Chris Whitty or from Jonathan Van Tam You know there's something they're trying to get across. And I kind of feel like going like, you know, you do not need a football analogy for us to understand. We pretty much get it now. It's not, you know, the first breakout of COVID. You can just tell us what's going on. Another question at Caroline really didn't answer. At Phil Brown. You're very harsh. You're very harsh. I'm England all through and through and it's Garrette's World Cup for me. On a serious note, everybody's talked about Garrette's Southgate being a defensive coach, defensive manager, not for me. I think you've got so much talent in the England squad that Germans will be running scared. They'll be fearing us. The amount of talent that we've got, since the days when Garrett Southgate played centre half for England, the game's changed. You don't make mistakes in your own penalty box, in your own final third anymore. It's on the halfway line, you've got plenty of time to make up for it. So your likes of Maguire and your stones and your Tyrone Mears, it doesn't matter about the mistakes. We've got so much quality in front of them. We will win the World Cup. Well, semi-final, followed by a final, you know, so it's creeping ever closer. Next one. Yeah. I think the key word that Hamper's England is guitar. And, you know, we look through the history of the World Cup of who wins World Cups where they're held. It's really important. But you never know. Who's still the answer? It's probability, isn't it? Probability. I mean, the likelihood, the more World Cups are being played, just statistically, England has to win one of them at some point. I like it. Rick, who's winning it? Hit your three lines again, mate. Is England? Oh, no. Yes. It starts here. For all my Celtic brothers and sisters, it starts here. I'm afraid it does. Also, I'm just trying to echo what Phil says, because I genuinely think we're going to have a great night out of the snooker now. Yeah. So England, and I think it will be Trent Alexander Arnold. I think you'll get six assists and probably score a free kick winner. There you go. Wow, wow. Henning, you're in a good position. That's all I'm going to say. Here's the scores. Rick's on 33. Still trying to make up that final bit of ground. Carlines drop back now to 35 points. What, since we actually made this a serious sporting quiz program? Yeah, Hennings on 37 and Phil Brownie won the game changer and that's what it does. He's up to 39 and then the Lee Brownie. Come on. Come on. Come on. Good stuff. Reminds me I must book an Uber when you're finished. Right, it's a quickie panel. A fight and talk tradition. Give me your New Year's resolutions for sports stars. What would they be? Rick Edwards. So I think it's time to stop. This is for footballers. It's time to stop with the over elaborate, overplanned choreograph celebrations. And I sort of knew that Phil would be with me on this. When you've got Mikhail Antonio, who, to be fair, I love getting a life-size cut out of himself printed, then stashing it by the side of the pitch, then whipping it out so you can recreate a scene from dirty dancing. It's gone too far, lads. Along for the days of just a simple, shira, Armloff wheel away, I don't need to see a Chesterfield player suck in other players' toes. There are players that have set celebrations and they do it. I mean, Monsala, for example. But you're right, there's not really any ones that I would do in the playground. Do you know what I mean? There's not a huge amount of the ones that are, okay, I want to reel away and do a Roshi or a Shere or whatever, a Robbie Keene, even, you know. I mean, no one could really do a Robbie Keene, to be fair. No, no, no, I want to reel away and do a rushy or a shear or whatever, a Robbie Keane, even, you know. I mean, no one could really do a Robbie Keen, to be fair. No, no, or not try it anyway. I do a drogpa, you know, just the hands of thrusting out to the side I liked. Yeah, yeah. Very rare, I school. Ronaldo? Yeah, the run out. The jump, the jump, Ronaldo? I hate the jump, Ronald. That's why I want him to retire. I don't like the jump Ronaldo either. It's like something from a really bad superhero movie, you know, it ran out of bunch of. Or a video game. Yeah. Just to clear that up. Henning. Well, let me try and end up myself to you, Colin. I've got a message. You haven't after like 10 years, Henning. It's not going to work. Well, I've got a message for the England football team. It's not the winning. It's the taking part. Thank you. Yes, there you go. Good year's resolution. Well, I've got a message for the England football team. It's not the winning. It's the taking part. Thank you. Yes, there you go. Good year's resolution. Well, please. At Phil Brown. I know you've got loads of music, Colin. Have you got the Beatles? Give a piece of chance. All we are saying. I don't. But it's a pre-record, so pretend it's there. And it'll be magically cut in. Three, two, one. All we are saying is give managers a chance all I'm saying is give us a bit of time out there you owners out there give us a chance will you cut us some slack and give us some time carline barker new year's resolutions for sports stars I quite back that with Phil Brown and we love a managerial transfer window. So I'm with you on that one. Roy Keen needs to be more serious and Michael Richards needs to lighten up. Jose Marino needs to say yes to the Harry Potter remake, the special wand. But mainly, Messi needs to resolve not to score one single goal or assist in 2022, but still take home the ball on the way. Right, right, exactly, exactly. Can't I get any more embarrassing than that? Right, here we go. A one word or the end with before AOBs. Crystal Balls out, I want your single word for 2022. So when it gets to the end of this year and I say, what one word sums up, 2020 in sport? What is that word? Phil Brown. McElroy. I'm going to need more. What is that word? Phil Brown. McElroy. I'm going to need more. Colin Morikawa's took over. He's just took all the pressure off. Rory, I think he's going to row back. McElroy will be number one golfer at the end of this year. Find that consistency again. Henning. Human rights. That's two words, but I will... Mentionreste, then it's only one. Yeah, let's say it in German But yeah Oh brilliant, yes, do that Caroline Memorial Mainly because I can't say it on the radio Sustainability That's the word I'm going for Yeah, Rick Variations on a theme of hot High temp, boiling, fatigue heat exhaustion So variance basically Right Scores before any other business With Rick on 42 Look at that Just clawing it back Like the horse at the back of the hate exhaustion. So variance basically. Right. Scores before any other business. We've Rick on 42. Look at that. Just clawing it back. Like the horse at the back of the pack, Phil Brown. Just coming around on that rail. That probably been no sense whatsoever. Caroline's got 43. Henning's got 44. So Rick, just two points off the final. And Phil Brown's on 46. Wow, what a bad show. This must be. It's any other business time. And we're going to change it slightly. We, what a bad show this must be. It's any other business time. And we're going to change it slightly. We're going to do your New Year's Day message. Phil. Oh, you would do that, wouldn't you? You're going to mess up here. No, I'm not going to mess up. I'm just going to ask you this question. I'm describing a man here who's, since he's became a coach, he has three promotions from the championships to the Premier League. He's been involved in seven playoffs of which he was successful in three of them. He's managing all five divisions in England and also being across the India recently. Any ideas? You. Thank you. I'm available. As always, they come and get me play. I love it. I love it. This wouldn't be the same. This wouldn't be the same. This wouldn't be the same. But everything that you said was true. Thank you. Everything you said was true. Henning, any other business? My message is to those people we saw in 2021 who were sitting on their own, in their own car, with a mask on. Get a grip. Pull yourself together. You won't catch the virus of yourself. Do you know what? I'll back. I think science is going to back that up as well. So that's good. That's good. Take that one. Novak Djokovic, that's safe to tweet. Caroline. I'm going to go for something inane. Dentists. They're not the go for something inane, dentists. Not the dentists are inane, clearly. But when they start a conversation with you, when you walk into the room, you're sat down, and then halfway through the conversation, clearly they rip your mouth open and have it open for three hours and expect you to respond during that moment or talk over you during that moment to their colleague. And all you're doing is the old, which is what happened to me. few months ago back in 2021. What did you get done? Me. Yeah. I had them capped. I had different caps and I thought I'd been brave. I had to have four teeth caps. I thought just do it in one here. I have not eaten properly for about five days, which is a good thing. To go on the dentist diet. Dentists love them. Takes a while. It does good stuff. Rick, you're any good thing. So go on the dentist diet. Dentists love them. Takes a while, does good, good stuff. Rick, you're any other business. I'll tell you now, you need four points to make the final. Interesting. Well, first thing I'll say is I think that Caroline should get a point because that literally happened to me today, at the dentist. So I can absolutely corroborate. Horrible business. Are they open on January the first? Well, no, we're pre-recorded, remember? So we did this in October. Yeah. So my message is for everyone with... This is actually quite nice, I think. This is genuinely useful. For all the people who are hung over, listen to this. I recommend the following. This is something that my wife and I do developed. It's the Diet Coke and a nice cold lager, alternating sips. The coker lager takes the edge right off. Genuinely, thank me later. Four points? I'm guessing not. I'm guessing not. You haven't tried it, mate. So what, you have a Coke? You have Diet Coke and a cold lager and then you take alternating sips and it cures the hangover. Nothing makes a Diet Coke taste good. Rick and Caroline have 45 points each. Henning Vane makes this New Year's Day Defend In-Defensible with 46 points and should win as he's going up against Phil Brown who's in the final with him on 49 points. Come on, Eddie. Yeah, come on, Phelan. What we made of, son, what we made of. England, Germany, here we go. Stage is set then, you've done it for me. Let's do it. 20 seconds each you must defend the indefensible. It's for the first win of 2020 on Fighting Talk. No matter how hideous the statement is, you have to back it up. Henning Vane, you're going first. Oh, here is your defend the indefensible. The one thing that I, Henning Vane, hope for in 2022, is a large number of career-ending injuries to German footballers. Yeah, I mean, let's be honest, the current crop, they're absolutely useless. Haven't won a major trophy now in seven years, so 84 months of hurt. So it's like, yeah, no, there's nothing. I mean, we got rid of the manager. That was definitely a step in the right direction. But if there was just a complete clear-out, they all get their legs broken and start again. Very good, very good. This could be one that you just can't do, Phil. So let's try it. For me, Phil Brown, all sport is meaningless following the news that Little Mix are breaking up. Oh, absolutely. Right at my street that by, the Little Mix, the girl that broke up. She's from South Shield, same place as me. And we've just got this propensity towards standing up and making a name for herself, regardless of what it is. Now, Little Mix, as far as I'm concerned, I would pay money to go and see them. They were fabulous on stage. Where the records are concerned, I'm not too sure about that. She needs to go into footballist girl okay I can't believe you filmed the 20 seconds on Littlemix I tried I love the fact you guys do it is one of them really from South Seals or did you just make that up no no Lee's right okay because you got a wee bit lucky there Hennings was brilliant though I don't know I don't know I don't know I don't know I mean I'm probably gonna have to give it to Henning Vain. I think I'll give the win to Henning Vain. Yes, there you go. Germany beats England. It might be the time we win all year. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, it might be your first one. It was very close. So two very good defending and defensible. Thank you to Rick, to Caroline, De Henning and the Phil. and most importantly, thank you for listening to Fighting Talk and kicking off 2020.

Up next, it is Five Life Sport. Fighting Talk is a world's end production for BBC Radio Five Live. It's a Fighting Talk is a world's end production for BBC Radio 5 Live. It's the Fighting Talk podcast Extra. So for all the proper hardcore fans of Fighting Talk, get to hear this. We should probably then tell you the truth, so we're recording us. What did it is today? December the 7th, something like that. Yeah, it is. It was kind of just building up to Christmas. And it's about 8 o'clock at night. We just finished about 8 o'clock at night. I've ordered my Uber. Yeah,'s about 8 o'clock at night. We just finished about 8 o'clock at night. I've ordered my Uber, Phil. Yeah. Double time, by the way. What time are you going to bed at for the breakfast show, Rick? Are you into the baby sleeping power? You're like 7.38? Really? That early? Genuine this is past my bedtime. Yeah. It's a nightmare. Do you find it weird? Because, like, it's supposed it's easier in the winter, right? Because it's dark. But like in the summer, you're going to be going to bed when it's light. Also, I finished it, you know, like just after 9. and then I now live in Manchester I don't know anyone in Manchester so I'm just lonely for the whole day and then I go to bed at 7.30. Do you go to like um have you befriended sort of people that work in garages and stuff like that? No I suppose that's the thing to do isn't it? Yeah just talk to random. Do you want to go for a pipe? I'm getting on quite well with one of my taxi drivers actually. Right you never know. It's gone of it. You're not. Can I suggest work colleagues first before random people in garages? Yeah, maybe. Well, have you been in five life? Not sure. Not sure. Who do you want to befriend there, you know? Go to yoga classes. You always meet nice people at yoga classes. Yeah. I mean, I have actually been to a yoga class, but I don't know how I meet someone at the yoga class. Yeah, not much conversation going on. Not really. Yeah, but after in the dressing room, and do you fens your coffee and all that. So, yeah, keep going there. Okay. All right. Thanks, Henning. Appreciate that. They are nice people, that's true. I mean, we're not going to debate that. You don't get much violence breaking out at yoga classes and platies. Well, if you do, it's very slowly. Very slowly. Stretch out your right fist. And I went to yoga once. It was all right. I don't know. That was a great story. Yeah. It's excellent. Absolutely loving. This must be a nightmare for you guys because you're all stand-up comics and they must be flooding through your brains, the jokes. No, I've got nothing. Nothing at all. No, it's generally the worst podcast extra topic we've probably ever had. And when you say all stand up comics, uh, sorry. Just Henning. There's one. Yeah, there's one. I've seen Colin enough. I mean, Rick's quite funny sitting down. Yeah. The other three of you, you'll talk for a living. So, uh, what's your, um, what's your hopes for 2022 then? What's the plan? Get a job soon, Phil? You want our job our job soon or what are you relaxed about it I've got one of two aines in the fire you know I've just um life begins at 60 I've just started writing a book nice I'm doing some weird things from 60 to 62 and by the time I get to 63 I'll have another child and I'm thinking about airline pilots I'm thinking about a lot of things but seriously learning to fly? Are you seriously? Have you got a pilot's license? No. You're learning now? Yes. Right. No. You're writing a book, you're having a kid and you're learning to fly. Yeah. That's your 2022. Fantastic. That's a lot. There's not much room for anything else, Phil Bryant. Well, it is. Almost the definition of a late midlife crisis. It is. Almost the definition. But I'm saying midlife. That means I'm going to live till about 125. I'm happy with that. I did exercise late there, Phil. No, come on. Cut me some slap. You're not living to 120 Phil Brown. Can you figure a managerial job in there? I know, but it's one of them where I think that's flown now, isn't it? It's gone past me. I think I've been there, seen it and done it, and I'm disappointed with the responses I'm getting so late moves on, you know. I think you've got to. I'd love to do a stand-up. I'd love to have the proverbials to get up and do what you do. It must be frightening when you first do it. You must be doing lots of after-dinner stuff. I've done after-dinner stuff, but it's a different gig to what you do. I mean, when you stand up there and you've got to be funny to people. You're buying right's you're buying right you're buying right I do a lot of that stuff a lot of words I love it and I know I'm not to sound like an arse but I know I'm good at it right I'm good at it I can go up for 15 minutes in a room at the grove in their eyes or whatever and I can make everybody laugh but everything I'm doing is true like you might you might kind of stretch it you'll know this right you might stretch it a little bit but it's ensconced and real stuff that's happened to you might kind of stretch it. You'll know this, Rick. You might stretch it a little bit, but it's ensconced and real stuff that's happened to you. You might, but a comedian has an arc, a good comedian, like Henning has a narrative arc. He tells a story, and all of it might be ingrained in complete fabrication to get to where he was here. And he can make me believe it happened, or he can take a subject and riffing a subject. To me, that would be like losing all my clothes on stage in one second. Bang, I'm naked. And I tried it once at a corporate heading and just walked off that stage, and I was like, now I know the difference between a comedian and somebody who can get up on stage and be funny. Yeah, but there you pick the hardest environment possible to do it, like a corporate gig. So, because no one is there to see whoever is on stage. They just want to have a corporate do, want to have beerswis they're made. So half of them or sitting round round tables, half of them aren't even facing the stage. So you couldn't have a hard environment to start. But if you go to a normal comedy club where everyone faces the stage and they're there to see comedy, everything is lit properly. And then you feel your way in that way that will be so much easier it's no doubt you both could do that what what a bite i'm doing one tomorrow night actually i'm going to do my um following harvey elliott around harvey nick story and see how that goes um what a bite could you so for example let's say a tour you have when when's your next big long tour? It's the whole of 2020. Right, you'll be out making up for lost time, right? Like so many comedians. What would you? Would you let him train and do like a 10 minute opening slot for you? Would you let Phil Brown open for you? I'll give you it, there's a few places you don't want it to happen, right? Have a look at the clubs he's managed. I thought you'd talk to me there. Now, Phil, would you be available for about three, four gigs a week for about 35 weeks of the year? Oh, that's wonderful. Or we could, let's start with just your gig here or there. But if you want to give it a bash, I'm afraid. Yeah. You're talking about 120 gigs? Yeah. Would you do one? Would you do this a challenge? Like, if a bash, I'm up for it. You're talking about 120 gigs? Yeah. Would you do one? Would you do it as a challenge? Like if he said you could open up for 10 minutes in a venue and just... Unannounced. It's just got to go on stage and don't deal. If you prepare it, it's a waste of time. That's unbelievable. That's just random thing. This is went from the worst podcast extra to the best. Is this a done thing then? Yeah, more than well. I love it. Can it be in Bristol? It'll be Wiccan mine. Yeah, Wickeham squad because the Wicom squad, they always come to the gig anyway, like Gareth and Oly Screw. So, and then, but then he might think you're after his job. No, no, no. By the way, if... Take him to the Premier League. Yeah, he is. He is taking him to the Premier League. If that night is Phil Brown doing comedy and Garthane's worth singing, count me out. I'm not going to be there. Right, that sounds fantastic. Were you at the final against South End? No, I was working. Were you? Yeah, yeah. I'm up for going to that mix up a beat fan. Oh my God, this is great. Is this the tickets that one? You're learning to fly. You're going to do a support act now to Henney. Go to the alley-pally with you. You're not going to the alley-pally with you. I won't go to the alley-pally with me, though. I won that round, didn't it? Yeah, you won that round, but it wasn't real. I'm not going to talk to you. I'm not like Colin. Phil, I'm not like Colin. What I say is actually real. Even though Colin about two minutes ago said all I say is a load of nonsense and made up in fabrication and being put together. What I'm saying is real. Okay. And if you want to do 10 minutes, you're more than welcome. We'll exchange them. Yeah, we do that. Let me ask you. Do you know the other good news about that? Go on. It also takes up the 10 minutes of the podcast extra. Yes. Yeah, exactly. Just stick it on. And I think that there should be sealed with a pint after this. Oh, absolutely. Let me, um, before. You mean we don't get paid? Let me finish. Let me finish the podcast extra. Ask you a serious this. Oh, absolutely. Let me... Do you mean we don't get paid? Let me finish the podcast extra, ask you a serious question. All those dates you've got to do in 2022. So no matter what's going on your life, no matter what your day is, you wake up, you go on stage, you have to be funny, right? And you have, by and large, the routine that you've perfected. Is it always escapism? Like, when you step out in stage, is it always escapeism from your life, whether it's good or bad, or do you sometimes have to perform on stage genuinely, genuinely miserable? Does that make sense? Well. Because if I'm having a bad day, I can go on the radio and I'm all right at night. Like, honestly, no matter how bad days, when you start and it at least suspends it. Is it the same when, I mean, you would understand that, Rick Caroline, same with you, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. No matter what's going on your life, as soon as the mic's open, you're all right for that moment. It's like a little, it's like a little womb almost you're going to. I mean, like, if you just compare with you calling how stroppy were before the recording started. And then the music comes on, the music comes on, is all smiles and is all happening. So that is genius. Is it the same we play live? I thought he was quite stroppy during the show, is all smiles and is all happening. So that is genius. Is it seem to me play like... I thought he was quite stroppy during the show, actually. I'm never stroppy. I'm never, I might be disappointed, but I'm never stroppy. Right. Unless I've really thrown me toys out of pram. But, uh, no, so for me, it's like, it's like, it's, it's just more professionalism. What does Wayne Europe, a bad warm up? Yeah. It's all right. Yeah, I mean, that's already accounted for in many ways. I've just had a looking ticket master here. Henning Vane's Wickham gig was sold out. And now I believe there's tickets available. Tickets available in the door. Great quarters of people claim they've got COVID. Yeah, and that's saying something. That's saying something because this is pre-recorded. Just word of mouth. It's caused that. Right, thank you to all of you. Thank you, Rick. Thank you, Caroline. Thank you, Henning. Thank you, Phil. Happy New Year, everybody. Thank you for listening. Happy New Year.
