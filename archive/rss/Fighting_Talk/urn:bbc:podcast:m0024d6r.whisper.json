I'm Rick Edwards, and welcome to the show. I've had the patio heaters out. I've been raking the pitch. The fighting talk ground is breaking up a treat. Is that sandpaper in my pocket? Let's see who is ready to sweep a miss today. Two veterans who've seen it all and two wide-eyed debutantes with a slight caveat. One of them might have been on before, but can't remember. First up, for people in their 60s, aka everyone who listens to this show, this guy was pretty much the only person on telly when they were growing up. A fighting talk legend, two-time champion of champions winner, stand-up and presenter of In Bed with Dinner, win-lose or draw, Don't Look Back in Angora. I could go on, but I won't. Bob Mills is here. Hello, Bob. Of course there was only three channels then. Don't do yourself down, Bob. Don't do yourself down. You arrived in a flat cap today and I have to say it's a good luck on you. It's a fantastic. I'm not going to go into details, but it's a gamekeeper. That's not like, oh, I like her. It's not a game changer. It's called a gamekeeper, the hat. It's a very specific type of hat. And if anyone, if you ever wear one and someone says peeky blinders, you can punch them really hard. I was never going to say that, but it suits you. Also, you have written your answers literally on the back of an envelope. Not just an envelope, an envelope that I was paid cash in. It's one of the most old-school things I've ever seen. And never let me say you take the show too seriously. Another veteran of the fighting talk game, Telegraph writer and Manchester United fan, The Thinking Man's Jim White. Jim White. Hello, Jim. Hello, Rick. The last time... That's nice. The Thinking Man's Jim White, that's nicer, because Bob Mills told me before and he's got me in his phone as the other Jim White. Yeah. That's harsh, isn't it? It's harsh, but it is also fair. But I think the Thinking Man's Jim White is how I'm always going to introduce you. Last time you're here, I don't know if you remember this, Jim, you were on very fiery form and I'm hoping to see a similar glint this time. Was I? Yeah, you were. What, you mean aggressive? Yeah, I do mean aggressive, yeah. I liked it. Nice to have you here, as always. Now we've got a first fighting talk for this former presenter of the year who follows in a long line of Radio One Extra Breakfast Show host to appear on Fighting Talk. Expert level in badminton, gospel music, climate change and arsenal. A large team of researchers discovered that both their parents were accomplished badminton players. She prefers basketball, but it's just too small. Swazzie McKayley's here. Hey, hello! How's it going? It's good. I feel like you've drummed me up to be very tall, so I just want to say on records, I'm 6'1 on radio. In your life, it might be a different story, but we won't get there. Well, put it this about it, I'm having to sort of crane my neck to see. I suppose the obvious question is, were you any good at basketball? Because there are some decent little fellas. I mean, I could be a small PG, do you know what I mean? As long as I could just lead a team. But to be honest, I'll stop growing in year 8 and then after that it all went down here. So swapped it from Mike. Well, good to have you on board. Thank you. And finally, we think another debut on. A striker who played for crew, Norwich and West Ham, capped by England once and then, you know, once you've got one, you don't really need any more. You've made your point. You're really good at football. A rather unkind theme song, I think. There we go. Dean Ashton's here. How are you, Dean? You're right. Very well, very well. I really tried hard to remember when I was on. And yet, you just can't know. It feels like the kind of thing you might have done, doesn't it? I believe you if you said you had been. So this is your, maybe your first fighting talk cap. Hopefully not your last and hopefully if this is actually your second, it'll be slightly more memorable than your first if you see what I mean. All right, let's get down to it then. Where is my bell? I haven't got my bell, so I'm just going to go with that one. Oh, that's very nice. It's better than all with Bell. First topic is all about these naughty little boys. Now, was that a call by Saliba? Bane for Saliba to be sent off, and the inevitable cheers, but the cover of the card is yellow. A review is being recommended, and we know what that normally leads to. The yellow card is changed. And for the third time this season and Arsenal player sees red in the Premier League. So Gunner's boss, Mikhail Artetta, admitted that his team have a red card issue. Doesn't plan to do anything about it though. Who else in sport then is experiencing issues and are they doing anything about it Jim? Rory McElroy he's got an issue with kind of finishing off when he's got a lead and why I'd suggest he's not doing anything about it is that in 2012 in the Masters he was two shots ahead on the last hole and blew it and did exactly the same at the US Open this year poor. And they're just going to say, and you're poor old girlies. And I'm past the court of their dishes to get them, you know, and um, people are saying that these are caused by thousands of blue and so on that, you know what a lot of it is going to that. You can use it. You're going to be able to Great A lot of Perkins So, it's a warm You know a little bit about that because it's so warm I'm just saying Great, I'm just saying It's a warm Maybe I'll go off a tournament Uh Jay I'm going on a town The EVE You just to with war I've gotten In hometown And I watch the family But you is who has got issues with injury. She's had to withdraw again in Hong Kong and I watched the final that she won. Incredible. The performance, the levels that she reached, she's capable of. Now having a master's degree in injury and rehab myself, I just really hope she gets to the bottom of what these issues are. She doesn't want to do the same as me and reach that peak and then just decide about enough. So she's got a lot of work to do, I think, and the expectation levels are so massive on her. I do feel sorry for it because nobody wants to be injured. Nobody. Is it worth thinking about getting Dean Ashton onto the Raducano team, I wonder. You'd love to see it. And I think that's Dean Ashton up there. Bob. I think there's a team that are going through something and they don't understand. And their fans don't understand it. They're getting really angry. And they say, how is this happening? Why is this happening? What is the connection between our dropping form? Right? And I'm talking about Bayonne and Munich, right, who were winning everything. They just kept winning. They said, you win the German Cup, you win the German League. They win the European Cup. What happened? Well, I mean, take you back just to just not that long ago. Harry Kane decided I've worked hard enough for Toplam and given my all for my team. I want to go and win some medals. And so he trotted off to Bayonne music. Now, listen, I'm never going to use the word Jonah, all right? All I'm saying is at some point the crew members of HMS Byron are going to start looking around thinking, it's since he arrived. He's a brilliant play. He's one of the best players in the world. He scored so many goals for them as well. You can't point a finger at Harry. Well, do you tell me then what's happened to Bayern Munich? Why have they suddenly started losing big games? Well, Bob, you lose a point for asking me a question. That is simply not loud. Swazzy. Okay, I'm not going to ask any questions then, because I've just seen how points are going to take it away. Very good. Ooh, gaming points. I'm going to go in a different direction, actually, and I'm going to talk about Simone Biles, because whilst the word issues may be too strong for her, she stepped away from the Tokyo 2020 Olympics because she wanted to look after her mental health, and she had that case of twisties which I didn't even know existed and of course she's only come back to the Paris Olympics and smashed it and got gold but I want to give her points for her Instagram caption that said lack of talent lazy Olympic champions when she's biting her gold medal as a clapback for the USA Gymnastics official and Olympic medalist Mary Lou Retton who called her those things and I just thought what a great clapback to go and win gold after stepping away and taking time to look after her mental health so yeah good on you Simone Biles and changing the game in that way sorry I drifted off for a bit there what's a case of twisties okay what do you drift off at the start of the show it's when you it's when you basically feel like oh so it's not biscuits it No, it's not biscuits. My problem wasn't if it's not biscuits. The problem wasn't that she got fat on biscuits. No, a case of twist. I thought, I said I bought you a case to twist these. I'd be excited. All right, question number two then comes from you, the listeners, who have posted on our social media channels. If you want to pose a question two, get onto our Twitter, that's Fighting Talk 316, or FT316 on Facebook. This week's question two comes from Birmingham's favorite Welshman, according to his social media profile. Hello, are you there, Birmingham's favourite Welshman? I am. Morning, Rick. Morning, panel. Am I just got to call you Birmingham's favourite Welshman, or can I get your actual name? You can call me Stephen, which is my actual name. Well, stick with Birmingham's favourite Welshman or can I get your actual name? You can call me Stephen, which is my actual name. Well, stick with Birmingham's favourite Welshman, I think. Is it a keenly contested title with a lot of popular Welsh people in the Midlands? I think it's me and Dean Saunders. Dean Saunders? I was thinking maybe Rob Oenshaw? Ongshore, yeah. Sandwich was out there for a bit. But you're the best one, and you were, just checking out your bio here, best male presenter at the 2022 Community Radio Awards. I was, and delighted to tell you, that I was nominated for this year's award as well, which is happening on the 16th November at the Cardiff City Stadium. No one likes to bragard, actually, Bairman's favourite Welshman. Your theme is... You're not fairly Route one stuff from us. What is your question, please? Well, with badminton being dropped from the Commonwealth Games 2026, meaning that today's fighting talk panelist Swazi can't host the event, as she did in Birmingham in 2022, what other event would the panel like included that they feel they would be good at hosting, not participating in, but hosting at Glasgow 26? Well, it's a detailed and interesting question featuring a, well, a dig at one of the panelists. I like it. Never a dig at my friends. Gonna start with Dean, I think. Well, I think it's Never a digger, my friend. Going to start with Dean, I think. Well, I think it's got to be darts, hasn't it? It's about time these athletes... It has to be, but I see a point, yeah. It does. It's about time these athletes got the recognition that they deserve. They are selling out arenas all over the world. Yeah. They're just allowing blokes of any age and women to just go and get completely drunk for five or six hours and that it's absolutely fine to walk out at 5pm down the road dressed as a lamp post. And I want to see this. The nicknames as well. Imagine that in the Commonwealth Games. Imagine. It's lively. And I think, actually, I do think you'd be a The nicknames as well. Imagine that in the Commonwealth Games. Imagine. It's lively. And I think, actually, I do think you'd be a decent host for it as well, Dean. Bob. First thing on the subject of the Commonwealth Games, no one ever wants to be interested in politics in this show. But if 13 of the so-called countries in the Commonwealth have said, we can't afford it, we don't want it anymore, and we're now doing it in Birmingham where we've got bowls and tug of war. Maybe it's time to draw a veil over this particular competition. Seriously, it's kind of... Do you think it's run its course? I think it's run its course. But let's go out with a bang. Yes. And please let me do what I've always wanted to do since I was a child and take over the role of Kent Walton and do the commentary for proper wrestling. And I don't mean anything American and cage fighting. I mean proper wrestling, where Kent was a unique performer because it ran live and it ran to a time slot and Kent not only commentated on, he choreographed it. He would very often say so we've got five minutes to go and it looks very much to me like Johnny Quango's building up for his speciality headbutt and Johnny would like ah sure has damn it's done it and then Kent would be so so lovely about it. Oh, what are the chances? Well, there you go. But it was a roller coaster and answer that from Newgoff. It was get rid of the entire thing and then quite upbeat with the wrestling. Swazi. So shouts to Stephen, who's this question has come from. And Stephen, if you're listening, you also won't be able to host at the next... Yeah, I'm that, Stephen. Because we both did it. We both were the NEC and it was incredible. And just on that, there was an amazing, amazing moment between Malaysia and Jamaica. And Malaysia, of course, incredible at badminton. Jamaica, we love your Jamaicans man, but maybe badminton is not the preferred sport there. But Samuel Ricketts went up against the Malaysian pro and during the match his shoes broke and everyone in the arena was like, what? What's going to happen? And the Malaysian coach called the game, press pause and gave Samuel Ricketts his own shoes. And so Stephen, I know you was there because we were both there hosting me. It's a beautiful sport is what you're telling me. Exactly. But if I had to answer the question, I would go with rounders. Oh yes, please. Yes. So can we get rounders in the Commonwealth Games? Because I think I'd win gold for that. Easy peasy. I mean, I don't want to lead the witness here, but that's a very good answer, Stephen. Jim. Yeah, that's great from Swazzi. A bit of nostalgia there. She's repeating what she said, the commentating of badminton. Because it's not going to be on anymore. She'll just give us that back again. Aggressive. Aggressive again from you. No, I'm going for... I'm wondering if you've got an area problem. I'm going for... Question one. I'm going for quad ball, which other people will know as Quidditch. And it's a real sport. And the reason why I think I'd be very good at commentating on it is I think I'm the only person who's ever watched a game of Quidditch Live. I was walking across my local park and there was a match going on and I stood and watched it, a gas. It's absolutely hilarious. It is the game from Harry Potter. Except there's one problem. You can't have broomsticks. So they run around with a stick between their legs throwing the ball at each other. It's magnificent. It's got to be in the Commonwealth Games. It would be a stite and I would be the man to commentate on it. Well, look, Fermium's favourite Welshman, we've got darts, we've got wrestling, we've got rounders and we've got quad ball. I don't think any of them we're necessarily going to save the Commonwealth Games. Who are you going to give the points to? Well, all good answers it except Jim's. I agree. But the extra points, Rick, this morning, can't go anywhere other than to my Commonwealth Games, Birmingham 2020, Bad with and Colleague Swarzy. This, I mean, I... She's been a bit of a, like a bit of a fix, doesn't it. We'll settle it after you, Stephen, yeah, we'll settle it after you. Yeah, I'm not, I'm not sure. I yeah, we'll settle it after you. I'm not sure. I mean, I'll be having a word with the producers about this because normally our safety net would have picked this up. But okay. Thanks very much. Birmingham's favourite Welshman. Enjoy your weekend. See ya. All right. Let's stop that music, please. Sorry, Rick, can I just point something out? You may. You used the phrase Birmingham's favourite Welshman. That's from his social media profile. Yeah. Well, that actually means is Birmingham's least unpopular Welshman. Okay. Well, should we get him back on our line? You tell him that? All right. Question number three. News this week that the British Museum is to exhibit the greatest hall of ancient coins ever, dating back to the Norman Conquest, discovered by seven metal detectorists in the Chew Valley near Bath, worth £4.3 million. But what sporting artefact would you be thrilled to unearth, Swazi? Oh, okay, I'm going to go for that gem of a TV moment between Serena Williams' dad, Richard Williams, who defended her during a 1995 interview. John McKenzie came at her for her confidence and he just went straight in and was like, don't pick on her, don't pick on her confidence, she said what she said. And I just think that speaks to every parent who is like, yeah, my kid is sick and leave them alone. And I think, yeah, for every dad listening, you must know what that feels like to defend your kids. So that would be for me. And of course, the film, King Richard was excellent. Will Smith played the dad so well. I'd be so sad if that wasn't true. So, yeah. Is this kind of metaphorical, Jim, or you're sort of digging up a VHS tape? Yeah. Either way, fine. Jim. I'd like to find the remains of Shergaar. It's one of the great mysteries of sport. 1983, the great horse that had won five group ones, including the Derby, was out to study Ireland, disappeared, never to be seen again. There was, the kidnappers did actually ask for a ransom, but the owner, the Aga did actually ask for a ransom, but the owner, the Aga Khan, refused to pay it, and never seen since. Now, I admit there's not going to be much left of Shergaar. But maybe there's a saddle, maybe there's, you know, a bridle, something like that. It might be some teeth, maybe. We need to get some information. Now, Dean Ashton was born a couple of months after, so he's out of the rain. We can't, we can't, we, it's nothing to do it. We don't suspect, he was born many moons after. Bob Mills, however. Bob Mills was, you know, he can't be ruled out of being involved in Scherger. There we go. In Cheshire. There we go. He was stable in Cheshire and he used to be in a field. And the teacher used to give me a lift to school, he used to say that's Surgar. He was a digestion. He used to be in the field. And the teacher who used to give me a lift to school, he used to say that's Sherga. He was a known liar. But I believe it to be true. Anyway, you snatched that horse and the rest is history. Dean, I found this quite difficult. So I went back to my youth. And my dad knew nothing about football. And when he came to watch me once I was a professional, I'd ask him about after the game. I didn't watch. I was chatting to the bus driver. He had no interest in football whatsoever. So when I got old enough that he could tell me something, at least, that he knew about football, it was the David Pleet run across the pitch in 83, which was the year I was born. So that was the only knowledge of football my dad had that he could impart on me as a young man. Now, where is that suit? And where are those shoes? And who is wearing them today? Great question. Did they end up in a charity shop, as somebody got the shoes or someone? Or does David still have it hung in his gallery? That's what I want to know from the relegation decider on that day. Yeah, so we're looking for a pleat. That's a complete suit. We're looking for Shergaard's teeth, maybe, and we're looking for a VHS from 1995. Bob? This isn't lost because I know exactly where it is. It's in Chesterfield. Okay. I've seen it in Chesterfield. Okay. It's in there. It's not difficult to spot because It's in Chesterfield. Okay. I've seen it in Chesterfield. Okay. It's in there. It's not difficult to spot because it's in Chesterfield's trophy cabinet. And it is something that shouldn't be in Chesterfield. It should be somewhere else. And someone needs to sort this out. Okay. The Anglo-Scottish Cup started in the 50s, but it was run seriously in the 70s, and it was the best teams in England against the best teams in Scotland. It was an end-of-season thing. It's when they didn't go off to Qatar for two weeks or, you know, America. They played this nice little tournament. And the last winners were Chesterfield. They beat Knox County 2-1, and so they had the Cup. However, in 1988, Coventry City had just won the FA Cup. Yeah, he said. Keith Houchin, driving header. Brilliant, one of the best goals ever. Great, we're in Europe. We're going to go to, oh no, we're not allowed in Europe anymore, aren't we? We're banned from Europe. So there's going to be nothing for having won the FA Cup. And someone came up with a brilliant idea. Let's revive the Anglo-Skottish Cup. St. Miron, I think, had won their cup. Let's have Coventry, St. Marene, it was brilliant idea. Let's revive the Anglo-Scottish Cup. St. Mirren, I think, had won their Cup. Let's have Coventry, St. Mirren. It was Builders. Let's find out who's the best in the land. And it's Coventry against St. Mirren. Put the full teams out. Just before Christmas, 1988, they played out the first single, which is a one-all draw at Highfield Road. Then the winter setting in Scotland, and February became March and March became April and April became May and the St. Mirren director said we just can't fit this into the fixtures. Just leave it hanging and we'll play it when we get a chance. That was in 1988, it's now 2024. The second leg has never been played. Look, look. I don't think we do this very, I mean, I'm giving you a lot of points for that, Bob, because that is A, fascinating. And B, is this something that as fighting talk, we can organise? Can we get Coventry to play St. Mirren? Well, the trophy's there. We know where the trophy is. You can get you, I trust that you can get your hands on the trophy. I reckon I can speak to someone at Coventry, I reckon. Same Merrin. Jim, you can deal with St. Mirren. Swazzi, you're obviously going to commentate. You've got a bit free time. Now Baventons out. I think we're going to do this. I like it a lot. Let's check in with the scores on paper again. Jim and Dean tied on six. Bob has eight Swazzi after an absolutely scandalous bit of insider trading with the question two listener in the lead on 11. Hello! Hello! Right, very quick one here. We're just going to say farewell to Jeff Cates, multiple winner of the world's strongest man. The Commonwealth gold medalist passed away this week at the age of 75, genuine superstar shot putter, ubiquitous 1980s television personality, much like Bob Mills. But who are the other individuals that transcended their sports, Jim? Eddie Edwards, Eddie the Eagle, 1988. And he's still the only Britain ever to appear in the Winter Olympics ski jumping. Yeah, it's a perfect one, Dean. Jonathan Edwards looks like a teacher, nicest man ever. Vibe of a teacher. And still a world record holder of triple jump. Has anyone ever done it? Has anyone else ever done it? No, I can't think of it. It's crazy actually. Swazzy. I'm going to go Michael Jordan. I mean, come on. No more needs to be said. Bob. Not transcending, still transcends his sport. MBE, Tommy Bosworth. The Walker. Yes, there you go. The Walker. Not A Walker. The Walker. Name another Walker. Oh, car. The Walker. Name another Walker. Oh, car. No, exactly. I really had to dig deep to get Tom Boswood at my head. It's not Walker. He hasn't transcended anything. Okay, next up, let's play a bit of this. Because the pop star Britney Spears went on social media so she's got married again and after a few faders she's decided to play it safe and marry herself. Obviously we hope she's very happy together and it really is until death do her part. But from sport, who would you most like to marry? Bob. Well as someone who's just celebrated his 40th wedding anniversary. Just say Tom Bosworth and get on with it. It's not something. He's walking down the aisle. Not that quickly. He's running. He's running. I can't tell this story on it just in case my wife one day wakes up by mistake and shoot him to five life. But I was involved in possibly, I was very young and I happened to meet an athlete, a woman, and we became friendly, we became friends. And then without knowing there was any connection, I then met another athlete, and we became friendly, and it all got. I once was involved in a quite unpleasant trio. I was thinking this feels like it's going towards threesome, and I hate it. Carry on. With Mary Decker and one side, Zolabad on the other. That's all I can tell you. Dean, I'm going to go for world number one golfer, Nelly Corder. Purely for selfish reasons. I love my golf. Just been at St Andrews myself. So I could just follow around, play all the top courses, carry a bag and other things if she'd like. More than happy to do that. Swazzi. I'm going to go. Shouts because after Chico, my actual husband, who I love very much. But if I could hang out with someone, it would be Ian Wright. Like, Ian Wright has to be up there. Surely he's everyone to call his person that they want to spend time with. So, yeah, Ian Wright, if you're listening hey come check us man basically hit any of us up we'd all marry him Jim despite my anger issues it's been a very very long time since I won fighting talk I need somebody who's going to turn me from a has been and are nearly there into a winner only one person Serena Vigman oh yeah, yeah, that's nice. I can actually see that. I mean, Serena. As a couple, yeah, completely. Quick checking with the scores. Much the same, really, isn't it? Bob and Dean on nine, Jim on 10. Swansea, still out in the lead on 15. That is it for the first half. 26 minutes down. 26 minutes to go. Stay strong, everyone. back to our panel, Bowles, enthusiast Bob Mills, legacy media enthusiast Jim White, early morning broadcasting enthusiast Swazi McKayley and get it in the mix of enthusiast, Dean Ashton. We are on the BBC Sounds app as well, which means if you've just joined us, you can go now and listen from the start and then you won't miss hearing up who our panel would most like to marry and other such earth-shattering insights. So let's get on with it then. Where's my... I'll go air horn, I think. It is game-changer time. So a report for the RFU has warned that rugby is failing so badly in schools, let alone the professional level, that it risks becoming, and I quote, a declining minority sport. This report refers to England, by the way, for any outrage Welsh or New Zealand listeners get in touch. But what are the other sports that you think might not just be in danger of decline, but may one day disappear altogether? Swazi. So I'm going to go with, and this is very unpopular, but I'm going to go a tug-off war. Just because... It's not having a great time at the moment, is it? It's like he's only flying high. we played it at our church sports day and honestly this game the war cries i don't know if you've heard the war cries or seen squid game but you know like the technique where they lean back and everyone gets involved so i'm going to flip it and say yeah this one it's superseded school sports day guys it's actually taking place in much bigger arenas, including Stockwell, Stockwell-Larkall Park. So, yeah, I'm going to go Tuggle War with that one. So, okay, I mean, I think Tuggle War is due a resurgence. Jim. Despite Snoop Dog's great enthusiasm for it, I think dressage is on its way out after the Olympics. Basically, horses like to run and they like to jump. What they don't like to do is do silly sideways scooting or whatever it is. There is one thing, however, that I think dressage might be replaced by, which is hobby horse dressage. I don't know if you've seen this. People actually, this is the second time I've talked about sports with people with sticks between the lace, but people on hobby horses now doing dressage. It's true. It's a big sport in Finland. Sometimes with your answers, I always think, I wish you'd leave a little bit loose at the end so that we can maybe come up with our own things rather than wrap it up quite so neatly. Bob, wraps on the out for me. Well, you see, rugby, you were talking about rugby. Rugby is suffering because in the schools they become ultra safety conscious, which of course you have to be, and they play touch rugby. And if you play touch rugby, you're never then going to move on to proper. And so the schools are failing it there. The sport I'm talking about, if it does die in the next 30 years and he may die, it'll be its own fault or the people who are supposed to protect it, it will be their fault. And that's Test Match cricket, unfortunately, which I love, which everyone who loves. But you cannot argue with the money and the attendances. I mean, we're not talking about England against Australia. We're talking about Sri Lanka against Bangladesh and these places. No, we could watch three games for the same money. We can watch two semifinals and a final in one day and have a carnival of it. And I'm sorry it's not being protected as it should be. And eventually, you're not going to have batsmen who can bat for longer than an hour. It hurts me, but I do think you've got a point, Dean. Well, if rugby's struggling, surely boxing eventually will get to that point, just repeatedly punching each other in the head, surely won't last long. The only thing that could save it is the fact that it's not in schools. You know, it's not something that you do in PE where you just get the gloves on and whack each other around the head in the gymnasium. But you've got to think if there was any lawsuits, the sport could be banging trouble. Yeah, I mean, you look at the stuff at the moment around footballers heading the football. If they've got a problem with that, at some point someone's got to have a look at boxing and going, well, this looks great, does it? Okay, so I've got tug-of-war, which is a nice answer, but also a silly answer, because I don't think it's really like. I was asking about danger of decline. It doesn't feel like it's up there anyway. Dressage, yeah, I think actually, probably the most likely, but I just don't care. Test match cricket, I really care. And I think you've got a point. And I really care about boxing. I think I'm going to, realistically, I'm going to give it to Bob. Yeah, I'm giving the five points to Bob. Where do you want to take your five points from, Bob? Any of them. What's this? That's right. That's right. Why don't you listen to the show, Bob? You know I've changed the format a bit. You're going to nick the five points off one of this lot. And you can do like two points from Dean, two from Swazzi, one from Jim, however you like. Of course I could do that. I could sit here and waste everyone to take a point of you. Take two of them. No, take them all off Jim one. There we go, that's lovely stuff. They're all gone. That's why angry, yeah. And that's exactly, No, take them all off Jim War. There we go, that's lovely stuff. They're all gone. That's why he's angry, yeah. And that's exactly, it's not going to calm him down. It's like the Hulk over that. Okay, we're going to stick with rugby union. The Wales coach, Warren Gatland, has issued a warning to the five Gloucester players that he selected for the Autumn International saying, remember to defend, which seems, I don't know, I'm not a rugby guy, but that seems quite basic, but good advice. Who else needs to learn a few basics? Referees need to go back to basics and do the simple things. I mean, now when you look at them at the start of the game and they've got all these contraptions on like they're about to set off on a space mission. A sort of slightly robocop feel to them. Let's go, you've got a whistle and you've got a little book and a pencil. Three things, that's all they need, to keep refereeing super simple. Get back to that. Forget about all of these contraptions and speaking to someone from another country, just do the basics of refereeing and blow your whistle. Jim. Sadly, it's the England Women's T20 team, and the message is, remember to catch the ball. Just catch the ball, guys. They dropped seven easy chances. Horrible. And they're game against the West Indies. And this was in the World Cup where they had a real chance of winning it and they blew it. Well also, when we were talking about it, well, it doesn't, I mean, they're definitely going to go through here. It doesn't even matter if they lose a bit. But I mean, they absolutely, they effectively wallop themselves. That is what's called throwing it away. Yes. Swazzy, please. I'm going to go for track and field people then because Noah Liles coming out very strong and celebrating before he even ran was crazy to be watching that. And so shout to us to Chico who when I first met him I was interviewing him on camera. One of the things he's always said is to have a short term memory. So if you go up for your layup and you make your shot, back on D. If you got up for your layup and you don't make your shot, back on D. I think it keeps your ego in check. I think it makes you don't pop up your chest too much, but also keeps you humble if you do win. So, yeah, my phrase would be short-term memory and just get back on defence. Ego in check, ego in check. Do you like the sort of history on extra Noah Lyles? Yeah, I do actually. I'm quite into it. I think he's great. I think as a moment, it was like, you don't celebrate before you've got on one. Do you know what I mean? So, yeah, I do love. We certainly don't do that and then immediately afterwards get taken off in a wheelchair. I said you had COVID. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on, let's be real. Who hasn't gone? Me. Yeah, go on then. There was a granddad who was the Orient passed away about 10 years ago. He was always with his grandson and his son, three generations. And the son and the grandson are still there. And his memory is kept alive at least, not once every game, because sometimes we play well. But five or six times a season, either the son or the grandson or someone else will look and get the thumbs up. And they'll do his, what he used to do, the granddad, which was to stand up and just say, for pity's sake, just kick it into the goals. And you don't get more basic than that. It's nice. All right, question number, whatever this is. L.A. Laker fans were a bit split after seeing LeBron James make more history this week. So he played alongside his eldest son, Brony, to become the first father-son teammates in NBA history. Unlike his dad, Brony is not considered to be a once-in-a-lifetime talent. Some have said, this is a bit of nepotism. When else has an offspring clearly benefited from their famous sporting parents? I'll go for Swazi first, please. Yeah, I'm actually going to keep it very NBA related. I'm going to go for the Curries because you've got Steph Curry and Seth Curry who both play the NBA. But then their dad, Del Curry, was also a former player. But do you know what? I can't even be mad at it because I know guys at the moment I say in Suarez, can you shoot freeze though. And no, you can't should freeze. I just sound like a hater. But I think when Steph Curry gets cooking chef curry with the sauce is too much so who can be mad at the curry family? Also, also, sorry. I mean, Steph Curry is a generational talent. He's not benefiting from his dad. No, no, no. I'm saying his son coming through into the league and also his whole family. I mean the curries are incredible, aren't they, though? I mean, I love the guy. I absolutely love the guy. All right, Jim. Darren Ferguson. He had a great career. He played brilliantly for Rexham. I think he scored. I think he played more than 300 times for Rexham. But he played 26 times for Man United when his dad was the manager. And I don't think many United fans at the time thought he was quite up to it, not when you had alongside him players like Roy Keane, Paul Skulls. Maybe Dad helped him there, I think. I think that's probably fair, Bob. Yeah, I would worry about that because Darren Ferguson, like his dad, and Nigel Clough like his dad, have gone on to be very, very fine managers. So there's no nepotism there. Nepotism, we have to make sure we understand what that means. It means an unfair use of privilege to your son. This is never to be confused with if your mum's the queen and she does, you become the king. That is primogenitor. That is not nepotism. Okay. Point for that. Thank you. Something intelligent for once in the show. If you want real nepotism, which I do. Al-Sadi Gaddafi said to his dad, I like football, really like it. And his dad said, do you, son? Right. What teams do you like? The voice is uncanny. My favourite is Al Ittyhead. They're a great team. They're your team now, son? Right. What teams do you like? The voice is uncanny. My favourite is Al Itty had. They're a great team. They're your team now, son. He takes over the team. They go from mid-table obscurity to three times double winners in a row, right? He then says to his dad, I wish I played for the national team. What? You're telling me you don't? That's something's gone wrong. Not only do you play, you're telling me you don't? That's not only got wrong. Not only do you play, you're captain, so there's all this going on. And even that, you think, well, that's understandable because the man's a dictator. People are terrified they'll do anything. But then, of course, Al-Sadi gets even a little bit. Yeah, it's all right here, but I'd love to play in the Italian League. Right. You can have to give me an hour. He goes over. He buys shares in Perugia. Part of the deal is that his son signs for them. And they say, well, listen, we'll sign him, but you can't be stupid. He can't play every game. No, he don't expect him to play every game, obviously. I think he plays six times. And then got shifted around on loan. Different Italian teams, Sampdoria, Caliuri, all took it in turns to face the wrath of Muma Gaddafi by having his... He's not fit. He's just lost that ounce at yard of pace, Mr. Gaddafi. But we're doing all it can. And his team of advisors, which were Ben Johnson and Diego Maradonna, they're doing all they can. And his team of advisors, which were Ben Johnson and Diego Maradonna, they're doing all they can to get him back to fitness, Mr. Gaddafi. I mean, I just want to hear one more coming from the Gaddafi's. Son, listen, I'll tell you the problem I've got here. I've got 8,000 American soldiers outside the house I don't think I'm going to be able to get you the move to Chelsea Dean Well I thought about this and I sat on it And it's been right under our noses all the time Which is Jamie Rednapp You know, Harry, his dad Harry He's almost manager, he comes through He then all of a sudden finds himself at the top of English football but then he sold him to Liverpool didn't he? But then just happened to retire early for whatever reason would he have married a pop star without Harry? Not sure about that. M&S ads and sketches you're telling me his looks have done that I don't think so Harry he's the ultimate deal maker that man. Dean, you summed him up. Retiring early, that's a suspicious sign. I think, I've got to say, we'll go to the scores in a moment. We've missed a really obvious area, which is Formula One, where basically if your dad is so rich that he owns a team, so if you're Lance Stroll, who frankly is a sort of average driver on a motorway in Britain can drive some Formula One car, or the Russian fella whose dad owned a stake in Haas, Nikita Mazepan. I mean, it was absolutely mad. It's just so naked. You're literally driving that car because your dad has said you're going to drive it. As soon as he left, they were like, obviously, you're not. You were useless. Let's have a look at the beautifully handwritten scores. Thank you. Oh, things are moving now. Jim, you are trailing way behind, of course, because you had those points robbed off you. You have 11. Dean on 16. Swazzy on 20. Bob out in the lead now on 21. Thank you kindly. This time last year, Duke Bellingham taken La Liga by Storm, already had 10, Golas to his name. So far this season, he has none, leading Spanish sports paper marker to say he's gone from a 10 to a 0. Harsh, but who has gone in the opposite direction in the same time? So from a zero to a 10 gym? Cole Palmer, and I tell you why he is now an internationally copied celebration artist. I was saying that NFL, you know, doing the old, I'm cold, I'm such a cold finisher. Yeah. All doing that. Yeah. So he's I'm cold, I'm such a cold finisher. Yeah. Yeah. So he's everywhere. Yeah, it's a very good answer indeed. Dean? Luke, Littler. The nuke, of course, has gone from nobody knowing who he is to basically, probably one of the most well-known sports people in this country anyway. Won the Premier League of Darts already. When the World Series of Darts. But what I love the most is he's still youth world champion. Because they haven't played it yet again. So he's still the youth world champion, yet he only just lost in the worlds of the senior championship. So it has to be him. Swazi. Do you know what? So funny. I've gone for Sacco, but actually only just seen that your question says in the same period. So I've also gone for Cole Palmer, which I know we've doubled up on that. But I'll just stick with Saka, just to say, all that pressure around missing the penalties and whatnot. And him just coming back, full form, he's such an inspo of just picking yourself up and still going regardless of all the pressure and whatnot. And him just coming back, full form, he's such an inspo of just picking yourself up and still going regardless of all the pressure around you. So, yeah, Col Palmer, of course, but in the fame of all things, Saka, I'm going to go with him. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think you're right. The time period is not quite right, but he has done it. Bob. I don't know if this is relevant either because it's a sport I know nothing about, but I do know that when I was a young man, I studied medieval popes. And it was the only time... Amazingly, you'll get a point for that. It's not an unusual thing. And it was the only time I'd ever come across this name until I started reading sports pages for the last two years. And suddenly, Lando Norris is all you can ever read about. And I thought, how can someone who's obviously a very religious Catholic family, because they've named him after the only other person who ever had that name, who was a Pope, and yet he's now in all the winning things and driving cars? You sounded for a moment like you did know about Formula One there, Bob. All right. Finally, how are we doing time-wise? We're all right, aren't we? A one-worder, as we prepare to bid farewell to the BBC's euphonium-wielding cricket man, Jonathan Agnew, who's going to be retiring from his role as chief cricket correspondent after the Pakistan series. So, let's pay him the greatest tribute that Fighting Talk can by summing him up in a single word so a single word on aggers bob measured yes good one d inspirational yeah yeah okay and jim just imagine there's hyphens too many too many words He can't do it, can't. Absolutely. Stop it, Eggers. Stop it in the, yeah. Okay, no, it is good. Swazi. Legendary. Yeah, there we go. There we go. Let's have a look at scores then. Jim's still trading behind on 17. Dean on 20, still very tight between Swazi and Bob. Bob just out ahead on 25. Suazi, you've got 24. Ooh. Well, we've only got any other business left, actually. So, on that, Jim, angry Jim, what would you like to get off your chest, mate? I'm going a bit cross about XL bully cats. I don't know if you've seen them. No, don't. Yes, XL bully cats. They're this new breed and they're kind of muscular, they've got no hair, they're very, very ugly, and they're bread to scare you. And they cost four grand, apparently, but they're so... I mean, one of the things about a completely bald cat is it can't go outside because otherwise it gets sunburned he hasn't got the protection of the fur and so on and so you're just gonna have a cat around your house there to scare visitors it seems a very weird thing to do and I thought is it being bred with how are you creating there's there's that they've... One's very short and squat and the other has no hair, basically. Yeah, okay, so sort of breeding Dean and Bob. Oh, no, Rick, that's too horrible. We're all bitterly, aren't we? The poor listener, that one poor listener who's thinking of what it is. Anyway, I just think it's an absolutely horrible, horrible thing. Until I learned that Katie Price has one. So, you know, I'm influenced by Katie Price. I've had the bum lift and so on. So I think I'll go and buy one. Four grand, apparently. Yeah, but reasonable. Swazzy. Oh, okay, I just wanted to come on and just shout my girl, Mag. She is an incredible publisher, and she's published a series of nonfiction books to celebrate Black British culture called A Quick Ting On. And not only she's gone and done that, but she's gone and got a national billboard campaign with J.C. DeCose. If you go around from Houston right through to South End across the UK, you can see billboards of the books that she's published. So shouts goes out to her. It's been an amazing journey. Small beginnings to huge steps. So well done, Mags. I mean also look at that. Suiza using this platform to shout out some genuinely impressive achievements and you're moaning about cats, Jim. Unbelievable. I'm lost, so it doesn't matter, does it? No, it doesn't at this point. Dean, Pelican Crossings, not to be confused with toucan crossings, but Pelican crossings. When you go up to a Pelican crossing, if you press that button, I think you are then legally bound... To cross. Yeah. To cross when the green person is lit up. Not before. Not before. Not before. Not before. Not after. The amount of time, I'm quite a laid back person, but the amount of times I pull up to a Pelican crossing, there's nobody there. There's literally nobody there. So you sit, as we should do, at the red light waiting. There's nobody there. You are legally bound and could be prosecuted, I think. And I am that person as well that once my son has pressed it, there's no cars in sight. I will make him wait until the green person is there. Not for the first time. I'm glad you are not my dad. That's fabulous. It's so trivial, but it's so true. I don't know how sort of personal this is to me, but I just want to say something. There's a, it doesn't matter who it is. It's Joe and the juice. They sell coffees and things in it. And very, very thin sandwiches. Yeah, in major high streets. And they do, they do some drinks. What are they called? They're not shakes. Smoothies. Smoothies. They're smoothies. They're not shakes. Smoothies. Smoothies. They're smoothies. They're supposed to be good for you. And they're one of the things that I'm allowed without guilt to tell my wife I've had when I'm out because they say, sure that's all you had? And I'm saying, yeah, that's it. Did you have a quasson with it? No, they don't sell quasson. They got that. So, having accepted that I have to do that, if there's something wrong with your systems and something wrong with your machine and you can't make drinks for the next hour, put a sign up, don't make me walk into your stupid shop and say, can I have a large unicorn's tears please? Yeah. Just to say, sorry, we can't make drinks in a minute. Because I wanted to drag them across the canister. Well, tell me that before I say unicorn's tears then. Look at me. Do you think it's easy for me to ask for unicorn's tears? Do I look like a man who believes in unicorns tears? Okay, let's have a look at the final scores then. Jim, you knew it, you've come last, you deserve to come last. 18. Dean, valiant effort on your first or maybe second or third go, we just don't know. 22. Swazi still tailing in just behind Bob. Swazi on 25, Bob on 26. So Swazzi and Bob go into the head-to-head, defend the indefensible. Ridiculous statement, you have to answer it. Doesn't matter how much it hurts. If I say I mean you, Bob, you got the most points, so you will go first and you have 20 seconds on the following. To honour Jeff Capes, all Formula One drivers should pull their cars around the track at the Mexican Grand Prix with chains. Yeah, because then we'll see what real sportsmen can do, what real professionals. And the chain, by the way, should be on a leather collar around their neck. Okay? And they should pull it, not, by the way, cheaters that they do now in gear. They should pull it with the handbrake at least half on. All right? And if they start to struggle halfway through, they should brace themselves like Alth Tupper. I mean, it's going to be pretty hard to beat that, I'm afraid, largely, because the image was magnificent. All right, Swazi. You have 20 seconds on. Presenting the badminton at the Commonwealth Games as a career low point, and I'm embarrassed that my parents played it. Mum and dad, if you're listening, I love you. But you know what? Sometimes you just got to go in and make sure that if your shoes do break, you look really, really, really sad and just try to play your best that the other team will give you their shoes, and it may even be the coach that will give you the winning shoes. So, yeah, Mom and Dad, I don't know if you're a size five, but if you are, please give me your shoes. I mean, listen, it was always going to be a struggle. A class of unicorn tears in a cup maybe. We can't make them at the moment, I'm afraid. I mean, it's never easy, but I mean, that was quite easy. I'm giving it to Bob. Richly deserved. The rest of you, your loss also, I think, richly deserved. Thank you very much for listening. This has been a World's End production for BBC Radio 5 Live. The podcast Extra is about to happen. We're going to be ranking Sunderland's greatest ever sports people, which shouldn't take too long. Asia is home to the most extraordinary life. The largest owls, the world's smallest elephants, the richest seas on the planet, the biggest of all big cats, the world's rarest bear. Asia with David Adenborough. If you think you've seen the best the natural world has to offer, think again. Starts tomorrow night on BBC IPlayer. Hello, you'll listen to the podcast extra of Fighting Talk. Pretty solid episode that. Really enjoyed your defending and defensible Bob. Thank you. For a man who doesn't like Formula One, you painted a very vivid picture. I like the idea of Landau Norris struggling under the weight of a car. Do you know something when I say who doesn't like Formula One, you painted a very vivid picture. I like the idea of Landau Norris struggling under the weight of a car. Do you know something when I say I don't like Formula One, what I don't like is televisually. It doesn't work for me. It's not great in person either. I mean, I like Formula One, but in person, you just see a blur go past every sort of minute 30 seconds. About 30 years ago, a little production company went to the NEC in Birmingham and set up a go-car track quite big. But the camera where it was such, you can watch the whole of the race. They got like an aerial shot of it. Yeah, that's good. And that's what I miss because if you... You know they do have that on the Formula One now. Do they? Yeah, yeah. You can't see the whole thing. Not the whole thing, but you can see a lot of it. It must be like to see a Skalex Street. I'd like to see the whole thing. Not the whole thing, but you can see a lot of it. It must be like a Scale X Street. Yeah. I'd like to see Tele-Sk Street. I spoke to someone. I'm sorry, this has just come back to me. I spoke to someone at the football a few weeks ago who, when he was a kid, him and his brother used to take out the Scale X Street, set it up, get it all going, and then start. But when they crashed, that was the end. That was the rule that their parents had made. If you crash, that's it. Oh, that's so draconian, but so good, because it took hours to set up as well. And you're going to crash. And you get excited on the first corner as well. No! Right, put it away. Put it away properly. Curves on curves curves straight on straight pack up the little stadium with the little figures that's amazing alright we're going to do the fighting talk rankings so we've got five rankers one each it is National Black Cat Day as I'm sure you know so who is Sunderland's greatest ever and I realise that this is slightly ambiguous I think I'm going to take it to mean Sunderland born but ever. And I realise that this is slightly ambiguous. I think I'm going to take it to mean Sunderland-born, but you can take it any way you like. Jim, who you got for me? I'm going Sunderland and FC's greatest ever, and I'm going Jermaine Defoe. Okay. And for two reasons, no, three reasons. He didn't play that often for him, but he scored a heck of a lot of goals. His goal to game ratio was extraordinary. But when he was there, he did the sweetest thing. I think any football has ever done, which is he befriended his lad, who was a mascot called Bradley Lowry, was it? And befriended him and, you know, it was just, it was such a nice thing to know. It was like he hung out with him. It was really, really kind. And for you know, it was just such a nice thing. It was like a genuine friendship. Oh, he was. It was really, really kind. And for the family, I think it was an amazing support. And then he left. And when he came back, he re-signed. It's one of the greatest television moments you'll ever see. Deadline day. It's deadline day. Some other bloke does deadline day, not me. Deadline day. It's deadline day. Some other bloke does deadline day, not me, but deadline day. It's deadline day and there's a fan TV station and the guy from the fan TV station has actually got into he's actually infiltrated Sunderland's training ground and he's there and this car goes by and the window winds down and he looks in he goes me it's tribonate the phone and i've never seen anyone look so excited it's a magnificent bit of tv we're signing him it's all that he's black it is it's honestly look it up it's one of the great moments of tv uh swazi um i'm going to go for Darren Bent. I'm going to go for Darren Bent. Probably scored one of the funniest goals in the program involving a beach ball. So I mean... Yeah, exactly. So who's not going to love... Who's not going to love that? But also, I don't know if you've seen on TikTok really, there's a video going round of him playing Pictionary. And he's actually quite good so Picternary is going to have to get the foot stepping on your toes a bit there I know yeah so dare Ben okay so far we're quite light on people from Sundland but never mind Bob no I haven't got one and from Sundner either but the great but the team's greatest ever play with that a doubt the man solely responsible for their greatest moment is Jimmy Montgomery. The keeper. The greatest goalkeeper, imaginable. Who was the game? You have to help me. I'm recently in the European Cup or whatever they're calling it now, the European Super League. Someone made a double save. Anana? Was it a Nana? Or Raya? Navi Ria and Anana have both made quite good. Double saves. And the pundits, or whatever they're calling them now are still pundits I think that's the greatest the greatest double save of it and I'm sitting there thinking mate go on YouTube it's not difficult and just put in Sunderland Leeds F.A. Cup final What year are we talking early 70s? Jim I'm looking at you. Something like that. You'll find it. 73. I was about, yeah, I was about 30 at the time. I can't remember, sorry. It's sort of, it leads dominant era. They're 1-0 up. Sunderland from Mid-Table Second Division have gone a goal up against the greatest club side in the land, without a doubt. And they're holding on for dear life. And they're just coming at them, coming at them like they do. You know, even now you see it when Man City do it. And they're just coming in. How long are they can hold out? A ball is crossed in and met by Trevor Cherry, who was one of the outstanding centrebacks of his era, right? Who brilliantly doesn't just head it, heads it down. Jimmy Montgomery just gets his hand to it to knock it out where it falls to the feet of Peter Lorimer, who for the younger people, was quite simply the man who kicked the ball harder than anyone could and more accurately than anyone could in the game at that time, who thinks, there you go, well done, you veiled out for this long, hammers the ball ball and Montgomery somehow from the grounds twists himself round and pushes it onto the bar. And it's just an exceptional piece. If you want to know how important it is, when the game finishes, the Sunderland manager, Bob Stoker, gets up from the bench and runs full pelt right through all his players and everything and just jumps on Jimmy Montgomery. Interesting fact about Jimmy Montgomery. Wasn't his last major final? Go on. Did he play in the Anglo-Scottish Cup? He was brought in... It's a great guess. He was brought in as a substitute in case he was needed by Clough for the European Cup final. Was it? Well, well, obviously we're not in a point situation, but I would give you a point anyway, but I enjoyed that. Dean. Yeah, not helping with the From Sunderland, but... No one for Sondland. Fantastic. A man that had a word added to his name, he was that good, which is Super Kevin Phillips. The whole Nile Quinn Super Kev combination in the early 2000. He scored so many goals. Unbelievable. And what's amazing is he's that humble Kevin Phillips is he didn't even realize that he'd won the Golden Shoe at the end of the season, which is the top scoring striker in European football he hadn't even thought that a player from Sunderland could win the golden shoe and he had he'd won the top scorer in all European leagues in that season and was just out of this world and actually was a bit unlucky not to get more England caps because of the quality that was around him. And sorry, you're jumping in and I'm really being pedant now, won it when it was still a genuine thing to win. Four British players have won it, Kevin Phillips, Alan McCoyce, of course, won it twice, and a guy who played in the Welsh League won it, his name, a skate's been, unfortunately, but he won it. That was before, and these things happen, VAR we all know about, but he won it. That was before. And these things happen. VAR we all know about. But under the radar, the people who are organised football do these things that maybe people don't. Why is the golden boot now, won by players from Barcelona, and no one from Dinamo Tirana or a Welsh league team? Because goals in certain league counters goals. In other league they count as one third of a goal and in some leagues they count as half a goal. So in some leagues you've got to score twice as many as Messi or Ronaldo, yes, to qualify to win that. This is an absolute scandal. That's how they now work it. Otherwise, I wouldn't even know how to celebrate scoring half a goal. Otherwise, Messi and Ronaldo, they're not going to win it. Because someone in the Icelandic league is scoring 40, 50 goals a season. Of course they are. And the League of Malta, you think someone there ain't knocking in 80 a season? But their goals don't count as single goals. Was the bloke who won the Welsh? He couldn't remember. He wasn't Swazzi's friend. Yeah, it was the question. Now he's in Birmingham. That's right. Well, I'm going to really butt the trend here by going controversially with someone who was born in Sunnardt. But who you would probably argue is a lute and legend, but I'm going from, because he was born in Sunderland.land. But who you would probably argue is a Luton legend. But I'm going from, because he was born in Sunderland. Mick Harford. Born in Sunderland. And as a young boy in the 80s, by no means a Luton fan, but I just absolutely loved him banging him in on that stupid plastic pitch. It's just a really nice memory for me. And he had a great look. And I just love Mick Harford. And also, sorry, even more as important he was as a player. He saved that, he kept that club going twice when Nathan Jones left recently. He took him straight away and said right from the start, I don't want this job. Okay, so don't worry. If you want to come back or if someone else comes in, I'll go back to my old job. But in the meantime, they played superbia. I'll take care of it. Yeah. And played really well under him because who wouldn't. So we've got four people not from Sunderland and someone from Sunderland who you wouldn't think was from Sunderland. So a perfect list, actually. Where is the... There we go. So here we go. In no particular order, our top five Black Cats are. Scored a lot of goals for them, not from Sunderland. Made friends with a mascot, Jermaine Defoe. Scored a lot of goals for Sunderland, not from Sunderland. Scored one of the funniest goals of all time, Darren Bent. Didn't score any goals, presumably, for Sunderland. Not from Sunderland scored one of the funniest goals of all time, Darren Bent. Didn't score any goals, presumably, for Sunderland. Not from Sunderland. Did do, in Bob's opinion, the finest double save of all time, Jimmy Montgomery. Someone else who scored bags of goals. Golden Shoe winner, no less. Not from Sunderland. Kevin Phillips. And then Luton Legend, but from Sunderland, Mick Harford. I think Jill Scott will be disappointed not to get a mention, and I suspect Jordan Henderson too. That is your lot for this week. Thanks very much, everyone. Was Amberlin really a wicked queen? People feared women who were smart. Flaygirl. What about resputeing? A miraculous mystic or a die-hard deviant? I think there's some bad stuff in there. I do weirdly respect him. On evil genius, we're the judges of that. Join me, Russell Kane and a host of comedians as we put more historical legends under scrutiny to find out if they're evil or genius. Evil genius. Listen on BBC Sounds.
