I can make it through the rain and stand up once again. I'm Rick Edwards, and this is Fighting Talk. Hello, not started the show with Mariah Carey lyric before, but it felt good. I'll be honest, it was a bit touch and go this morning, but we have had a late pitch inspection. The FT groundspeople have done a fantastic job. The heaters are blazing. The drainage is m-gw-gw-g-huff, chef's kiss. I'm all delighted that there is no cover over the away supporters. No doubt they'll still be tops off and singing, where's your famous atmosphere? But whatever we are on, it's happening with one quite key caveat. Most of our team are stuck up north, so I'm essentially in charge of everything, which feels a little ominous. On my way in, trudging through the driving rain, a man on a rental bike, cycle past, and just said to me, didn't know, stranger, and I can't say exactly what he said, but along the lines of, crap weather, in it? And then off he went, and, and just said to me, I didn't know, stranger, and I can't say exactly what he said, but along the lines of, crap weather, in it? And then off he went, and I just thought that for me is the perfect British interaction. It's complainy, tick, weather, tick, mercifully brief, tick. Really liked it. Michael Fish, that it was. He's fallen on hard times, if so. And someone, Google whether or not he's alive. I know, I know, I don't know. This is not an excuse, but it was a week of Christmas drinks and the fighting talk writers room. So it's just three words and a plug for our quick-fire intro. It's a bit like the second-rounded names in the hat if you've played it. So, you know, sort of sing a dancer, glitter or whatever. So we're starting with Comic Irish Liverpool. Tickets available now for Achilles Neil. His next soon to be sold out tour. Neil Delamere. Neil Delamere's here. Morning, Neil. How are you? Very well, actually. I get a bit frisky in the rain, I think. Wow, that sounds like the first line of a defence in court. Yeah, I get a bit frisky in the rain, Your Honour. You, I noted this week, are now the record holder for most correct answers on the celebrity version of the chase. Yes. That's superb. I got extremely excited. I led other people... It was like it was raining. Yes, it was a mixture between someone brilliant on Mastermind and Noah. And yeah, we won £,000 pounds for charity. Yeah, me and Jamie Borthwick, who came down very well. Yeah, I mean, to be fair, I also won £120,000 on a celebrity chase. It's no big deal. Yeah, that was beat the chasers, wasn't it? Yeah, same sort of thing, isn't it? Oh, look, look who's many, won so many quizzes that they all. But you, um... So you were with someone, were you? I was with Jimmy Borswick. I was just on my own, and? I was with Jimmy Borthwick. I was just on my own. I was just on my own. I walked into it. I just beat them all. Sorry, guys. I beat them all on my own. So, you know, you tell me who did better. Next up, Ronna, Villa, presenter. You could listen to her every Friday morning on BBC West Midlands if you weren't busy listening to me on Five Live. Kathmerie's here. Just here. Just 30 seconds ago, you walked't busy listening to me on Five Live. Kathmeri's here! I'm just here. Just 30 seconds ago you walked in. Thanks to Colin the black cab driver who turned into Max Verstappen. But I don't think Colin... What's extremely unpopular with everyone else. And I don't think Colin announced a new baby on the way yesterday either. But he drove really fast and got me here on time. It's great to be here. How are the nerves? Are you okay? Oh, I'm fine. You felt a bit stressed as you bowled in. No, it was a look of stress, but it was just me being out of breath and nearly pulling my hamstring getting here on time. So that's just a lack of fitness rather than my stress. Typical old athlete. Exactly. Also on, presenter, Welsh, Gamer. His new podcast, Press X to continue, is available now. Stefan Pows here. I've actually quite a nice leisurely morning. I came in earlier, I was here earlier. I've had a coffee, had a breakfast in the place around the corner, and I've had a lovely time. Well, I'll tell you what, you're not getting any points for that sort of. I've just been on it. This is a place where you can share honest opinions, isn't it? No. Only if you want to lose a lot of points, Stefan. Me and Neil, a nice chat earlier, nice to meet Jake. I mean, I can't have a chance to meet you, yeah, because you just bowled in. You're just bowled in you. You're just bowled in you're 10 seconds to go, but everyone else. There's been on. points, Stephen. Me and Neil a nice chat earlier, nice to meet Jake. I mean, I'm having a chance to meet you, yeah, because you just bawled in you. 10 seconds ago, but everyone else. No, no, no, stuff, stop, stop. I'm sticking to my principles, thank you very much. I'm having a nice time, thank you very much, Ray. I do like a principal man. Thank you. I've got a podcast idea for you. It's a bit like chicken shop dates, but it's about gaming, and it's in a kebab shop, and it's called End of Level Boss Man. Any good? You could do that or you could just listen to Press X to continue which is out no on Spotify and Apple in other places. This guy, actor, Arsenal, dancer. Just made a shock return to Eastern as is Max Branning. Oh no, that's next year's script. Sorry. Jake Wood is there. Yeah, Jake Wood in the house. How are you, Rick? Yeah, I'm good. Has our catchphrase come out yet? What is that? Catchphrase. Oh, Mark. No. We did an episode of catchphrase together, don't you. Don't you win that? I'm allowed to say, am I if it's not been out yet? We did that two years ago. I'd like him right now with you. I see what you see, but I can't say what I see to be perfect. It's like a quiz off happening in the studio to do it. Can I say? That is actually mad. That was like three years ago. Yeah, still not been out. I don't know. I don't know what one of us has done, but it's not good. My house of games haven't gone out either. My house of games is Richard Osmond hasn't gone out yet. I don't was that. That was filmed about, oh, must be a long time ago. Am I the only one? It's never been on a quiz show in this. Yeah. Have you not been Am I the only one that's never been on a quiz show in this. Yes. Have you not been on a quiz show? You'd be great on a quiz show. You're at Matt. You're a principled man. Thank you very much. I would look at you. But my very successful quiz got cancelled. Let's get down now. I didn't want to mention that, Rick. No, I mentioned it myself. Me awarding points with no clear criteria. Cath, shut up. First of a little, a little, a little bit of this. And Sonny Edwards is headed being reduced to a pinball. Bufferton left and right, push back into the corner by Galilee 5. Sunny Edwards is being overwhelmed. And again, straight shots firing in and the roar of the crowd tells you that Lee Every has stepped in to call a halt to this contest. Yeah, boxer Sonny Edwards, stunned fans during his long-awaited world flyweight title fight against Galal Yafai. The mics picked up Sonny talking to his corner man between rounds two and three and saying, I don't want to be here. And I think a lot of people thought, of course not. Not horrible, not a horrible sport. When a sport caused you to say the same thing, the principal man, Stefan, please. I'd like to take you back to 2006. Please do. Stefan is wearing etneys, those big sort of trainers and baggy jeans. Very similar to your jeans today, actually. Thank you. I had a mullet. There was tinted in the back. Oh to your jeans today, actually. Thank you. I had a mulette that was tinted at the back in it. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Tinted mullet. Did you say moulet? Yeah, moulet. It's a beautiful thing, that moulet. Anyway, I go along with 28,000, which is not even half capacity to the Millennium Stadium to watch Wales play Slovakia. They're in with a shout for qualifying for Euro 2008. I knew something was going to go wrong when I saw the goalkeeper Paul Jones who was celebrating his 50th cap that day shave the number 50 and a dragon into his hair. It was all going wrong from there. 60 minutes in, it's 5-1 to Slovakia. Wales have been absolutely battered at home and I think to myself... Still a chance. It was the end of a sort of semi, not even golden, let's call him a brown generation, not quite golden, a bronze generation maybe, that was coming to an end. However, Garth Bale did score his first goal for Wales that day. The 17-year-old scored a free kick top corner and that was the beginning of a very small silver lining and a very grey crowd. I did not want to be there after 60 minutes though. 5-1 Slovak. Yeah. Good answer and the mullet is sticking in the head, obviously. Neal. I like Scandinavia. I've been there several times. I like the Danes. If I ever see Ireland play Denmark again, I'm going to kill somebody. We played them six times between 2017 and 2019. The Irish children were being born with Lego pieces in their hands. People were walking into pubs going on with a pint of Guinness with the Carlsberg head. We saw too much of each other and I went to see them in Lansdown Road. We'd drawn nil-nil. This was to get to the World Cup in 2018. We'd drawn nil-nil in Copenhagen they came. We scored 1-0. We had hope. Hope is always dangerous. We scored, Shane Duffy scored. And then we gave away an own goal. And then Christian Erickson came on and was absolutely, we'll play it from the start, but he just came to life and scored a hat-trick. A friend of mine has watched a lot of Manchester United, a lot of Denmark, oddly enough, a lot of spurs and he said Christian Erickson has never been so electric with the one exception at the time he was literally attached to a defibrillator. He was unbelievable. Scored a hat trick, they hawkidus 5-1. I'm allowed to that joke because he's fine now. Yeah, that's exactly. Yeah, I just didn't want to be there. And they were better than us in the World Cup anyway, but Christ. Jake. That fight should have been stopped, by the way. Can I just say this, Sonny Edwards? I mean, any time a boxer is sat in the corner saying that they don't want to be in there, get them out. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But I sort of what he's asking is. His trainer wasn't having it. Well, yeah, I think because they've only just started working together him and the trainer. So probably they didn't, you know, he doesn't know him as well. And now he's retired now, so that's it. Well, yeah, and he was going to retire anyway, apparently, regardless of the results. So, yeah, he should have been pulled out. It was not good to watch. But no, I'm going to go to American football. Well, not, I don't want to go to American football. I've been to one game in America. My mate invited me, it was like the worst six hours of my life. I had no idea what was going on. I couldn't see the ball. And you've been on an East Ender's set. I've shared a hot tub with Ian Beale. Oh, thank God that's what I'm. Anywhere else? So I would rather do that again than sit through six hours. It was a terrible experience. If you get an opportunity to go to any American football game, don't go. It's just a waste of time. You know, Stefan, it's a massive American football fact, that way. Couldn't agree more, Jake. It's great on the telly. If you're at, it's a massive American football fan, by the way. It's great on the telly. If you're at home watching it on the telly, because you can see the ball, you know. It's not even good on the blind side. Stefan was having such a nice morning and suddenly he looks angry. Where were you watching it? And what were you watching? Because there's degrees, it's like watching Sunday League football. Oh, no, I was at the top. I was LA, what are they called? L.A. Rams? No. Raiders? Raiders. This is years ago. Yeah, yeah. It's changed. No, I went at the top. I was L.A., what are they called? L.A. Rams? No. Raiders? Raiders? This is years ago. Yeah, yeah, 19804. No, I went to see them once and there was a guy with a mullet of frustrated mullet sitting in front of me, so I've never seen it again. It's a strong look. There's a bit of a lot. It's a strong look. That was Raiders, mate. Speaking of mullets, Catherine. Yes, yeah, I think Jake's NFL is my baseball. I just get it. I don't get it. Anyway, I've given that line, the exact same line as Sunny did. After the Olympic medal that I won in Sydney in 2000, right? Every time it gets a mention. You know why? Because it's actually pivotal to the story I'm about to tell you, Rick, that's what it needs to be in there. That was my first full season, right? And then, so I went into 2001, really, really fast, really, really fit. I ran a lifetime best, and this is the fastest time in the world in my second race. I was heading towards the World Championships for gold. I got injured. And nobody in the UK could fix me. So I left the house that I'd just bought with the money that I'd earned from the Sydney Olympics, moved to America, got an apartment, got a car, spent thousands on a visa, because this is where the place I was going to get fitting back to being healthy again. And then literally one day, unprompted, unplanned, went to the track, put my bag down, turned to my coach and said, no, I don't want to be here. And he went, Kath, we haven't even started the session yet. That's a bit premature love. And I said, no, I'm done. I picked to my bag, turn around, walked off, and never went back. Wow. Wow. That's sort of a heartbreaking story. Just if you went to one game of baseball? Yeah, it was all because I'd been to see the team based in Arizona. I thought, I can't live here. I can't spend the rest of my life in this place. Did you try Chris Martin? Because he will try to fix you. He did try to fix me on numerous occasions, but I just didn't want to say. Excuse me. No, no. No. Exception of work. Excuse yourself, Mia. And I just confirmed, Rick, that I actually lost, you said that's a nice heartbreaking story and you took a point off of me. No, I didn't. I gave you two points. Did you? Yeah. Thank you. Thanks, mate. Yeah. Yeah. And no, point off a complaint. Question number two from you, the listeners who who are facing on our social media channels, Fighting Talk 316 on X, FT316 on Facebook, soon to be on blue sky. I don't know if that's true. This week's question two comes from James Dixon. Morning James. Morning, Rick. How are you? Yeah, not too bad. You have been on before, so this is your theme for life, and the producers have gone with... So it's Alicia Dixon because your surname's Dixon. I mean, it's pathetic. And what question would you like to ask, James? Yeah, very rude one. With Rick clearly hosting Fighting Tort live on a Saturday in December to avoid Christmas shopping, I want to know when have you used sport to get out of something you didn't want to do. It's actually a very good question, and you've got me bang to rights as well, James. Kath. All the time I use sport as an excuse to get out of anything that I think is going to be boring with any friends or family. It's, oh my God, I'm so sorry I can't come, because sports a ways at the weekend, family events and friend events for us at the weekend. So literally every time I don't want to go to something and send my husband on, he said, I'm working. I'm really sorry. I think the best time I used it, I was preparing for the World Championship to work in Dohaar in 2019, and I pretended that I had to go out to Doha three days earlier than I had to. Is your husband? No, no, to everybody. To everybody, it stopped me going. I'm really sorry, I go out to Doha three days earlier than I had to. To your husband? No, no. Well, to everybody. Do everybody? It stopped me going. I'm really, I've got to do extra prep. Ooh, it's the first time ever. Oh, I've got to go out. Sorry, I can't come to you, Ben. So I use sport all the time to get out of things that I just think are going to be boring. You can't do that now, though, because you've just sort of announced it on sort of national radio, isn't it? No, no one listens to this. No, no one. No, no one's good. And even if they asked me, are you calling me a liar? Are you saying my schedule? So my friends wouldn't do that to me. They just won't invite me anywhere anymore. I use it all the time, Rick. All of your answers, a slightly tend to sadness this morning. Sorry, I will pick up the pace, mate. Yeah, yeah. Stefan. Surely just arrived, to be fair, so maybe that's just the reflection of your mood this morning. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, well, hey, hey, hey, hey. That was genuinely, actually. Do you know what I mean? Take that back. I'm having a nice time here, Katz. This is a nice, this is a nice, this is a nice, a nice, a Saturday morning from me, away from the kids, and I have a lovely time. It's not over Wales that most of the weather problems are, but it's not his fault. Not my fault. Not, yeah. I think it's actually the heat in it. Is it just me or is it my age? It's really hot. It's a bit of both. Did you notice there, James? They're coming for me. Anyway, so James, I'll be honest with you, right? Sometimes if I can dodge a three-year-old toddler party, I will. So I bought tickets for the NFL in London. Oh, God. Rams Jags in 2019. Jakes, they can get me to the soft place. Specifically to get out of a bouncy castle party because if you're being bundled by 12 children that aren't yours that are carrying germs, if you can get out of that, then you do. And I did and I went to watch on a lovely time actually, Jake. Three hours. You've got to fly it, three hours. I don't lie. I don't lie. In Wembley which is a lovely stadium but needs a roof. Yeah, it does need a roof. Everyone says it. Jake. About 10 years ago, my son was picked for rugby to be in the first team and I phoned up work and said I had a flat tire so I could attend. Would you get your pay doctor for that sort of thing? No, as I said to my wife, there'll always be more episodes of East Lenders but there will never be the opportunity to see Buster playing in the first team for the first time. Those are memories you can never get back and I don't regret it. How does he get on? Yeah, they're great. They won't. Well, there you go. And he didn't miss the hot tub with Ian Beale. No. It wasn't that day, well. I don't want to hear that mention again, please. I want to mention in great detail slowly. Neil. Yeah, so this was put to me as a story of life versus sport where sport was the winner. Richard Osmond's House of Games is a great television show. Many of us have been on this television show and yours is soon to come out. Well, there's also a champion of champions. And they said to me, would you like to do champion of champions? And I would love to do champions of champions. However, another charity enough champions got in the way. I had to do this Poxy radio show that we're on right now. This sham, this charade with a psychopathic host, giving just randoms, like some sort of emperor. Psychopathic host. Just a thumbs up or thumbs down the pit and entirely on the whims of a child. Look at him. So I have to do this. But I love it so much, Neil. And Mike Holt, I said, can I get out with doing this? And he went, no, we've asked to BBC 5 live for 15 next two minutes. You've changed the good schedule. So I had to do this. That is, by the way, not how Mike speaks. That is. Nobody speaks like that. Okay, that's how I hear Michael. Hi, Mike, if you're listening. And then I have to go to the Champions League final. So I missed Richard Osmond's house hear Michael. Hi, Mike, if you're listening, and then I had to go to the Champions League final. So I missed Richard Osmond's house of games. By the way, if you're listening, this is a come and get me play. Yeah, yeah. To do this and to do the champion's late final. Also, there's quite a big fee disparity there as far as the guys, you're well aware of it. I wouldn't know Rick's. One day, Stefan, one day. James, who do you want to give the points to? Well, I really like Jake's answer, but as he spent his first question slugging off the NFL, can I give the points to Stefan. Yes, you can't. You know what? I felt like you might get a few sympathy points, actually, Stefan, because it does feel a bit like you're being bullied. What's your NF2L team, James? The Bears. The Bears? What's your football team, James? Birmingham City. Which is why I knew that James is a blue nose and there was no chance I was ever getting the points. But good luck at Barnsley today, mate. James, look, all I can say is she is in a very funny mood. And you can't really legislate for it. Have a nice day. Enjoy the football. Oh, no. Somebody honestly upset. That was. Oh no. Poor old James. Someone check is all right. Right. On to question three, it's been announced that sumo wrestling is going to return to the UK with some of the biggest names, and obviously bodies, booking two seats each to fly in for a tournament at the Royal Albert Hall next October. Just the second time the sport has been professionally contested outside of Japan. So I want to know what are the best examples of sports from over there being hosted over here. And I'll start with Jake. I used to love the sumo. Do you remember when they? Was it Channel 4? It was Channel 4. Yeah. The Waltz Gionof Fuji, the dump truck. Dump truck, yeah. The salt shaker. Yeah, the salt shaker. Glorious. The ballerina, he wasn't great. They were great. I used to like the little ones. You know, the little ones that come under. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Getting close. Yeah, I probably haven't watched it since. So yeah, so yeah, I'll probably try and get tickets for that. It's got to be better than the NFL. Do you want to go with me? Genuinely? Yeah, definitely. Do you want to go? I'm well up for it. Yeah, all right, brilliant. We're going to tickets for that. It's got to be better than the NFL. Do you want to go with me? Genuinely? Yeah, definitely. Do you want to go? I'm well up for it. Yeah. All right, brilliant. We're going to the sumo. Yeah, that sounds good. But it's got to be UFC, in it. If we're talking about sports from over there, over here, biggest combat sport in the world, valued at $12 billion, led by Dana White. It's just, it's brutal, isn't it? Absolutely brutal to watch. Probably, yeah. And getting some big fights over here. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It. Kath. This is going to go down very badly with Jake to my left, but sorry, mate. The NFL. Who would have thought bringing it over here would turn out to be such a triumph? I remember the first ever game in the UK. It was a pre-season one, wasn't it, at Wembley? Back in 1983, it was about a third full at Wembley at the time because most of the fans were like like Jay, because he is now. I don't get this, what's it all about? But then literally, regular games in the season, regular season games? Who had thought that you'd ever take regular season NFL games out of the US and put them in the UK since 2007? And they're just flying. I've been to three or four myself over the years. Are they still showing? Yeah. Two games are scheduled every year here. What a waste of time that is? Three scheduled games till 2030. It's just huge. I really want you to say that it's still boring, is it? Imagine that. He's sitting in Miami or something. Where's the next game like, you know, London? London. Blime. What's the point of that? It's not sumo. It doesn't like American football. That much is clear. Think about the environment as well. If we're talking about the environment. That's all I'm going to say. Please think the environment. Think about the environment. You saw the Elliot Readers in the 80s. 52 players. When I was a child. They all need two seats because they're massive. They need double seats didn't they because they're massive? The point Jake made there, 52 players. It's a lot, in it. That's all the staff and all that. There's hundreds and hundreds of people in it flying over. All right. We get it now, Jake. Stefan. I think I slightly misunderstood the question. However, I'm going to stick with my answer. Okay. Because it does get played over here, and I would like to see more of it, and that's Kabadi. If you ever watch Kabadi, another Channel 4 classic. Another Channel 4 classic, right? It's this amazing game where you're essentially tackling people and trying to touch them in this like squash court type thing. But what I love about Kabadi is that the old traditional rules of Kabadi, everybody playing it had to whisper Kabadi, Kabadi, Kabadi, Kabadi, as you played the game. So you can't breathe? Exactly. And it's amazing. And it's really physical and it's really strategic and it's tactical and they make it a real drama of it. More Kabadi, please, in the UK. Yeah, I've not got a problem with Kabadi. No, well, that's... Every sport that gets mentioned, we'll just check in and see what a change's got a problem with it. Thank you. Obviously, you didn't answer the question, unfortunately. We'll lose a point. Neil. I'm going to go for the greatest sport in the world, so this is the correct answer, and I don't care if you give me the point or not. It is hurling. Hold on. Hold on. Any problem with hurling, Jake? No, no problem with hurling. Do you know what it is? Yeah, of course. I love hurling. It's the best sport in the world. The fastest field game in the world. It's brutal. 15 players on each team, preferably from the same family. A ball that can travel at 100 miles an hour. It's like hockey if it was played by interesting people. A ball that is the density, same density as a small star. If you get hit on the shin by that ball, it's somewhere between the pain of being shot and your parents leaving you to boarding school at the age of 7. Shout out to my cousin, who won his second All-Ireland playing for Claire this not long ago. He... What's his name? David Reedy is his name. His resting heart rate is 24 beats. What? A day. On the hour, every hour. You're not sure if it's Netflix. B'Bahom. or it's David Reedy. He's an absolute legend. God, David Reedy. Yeah, it's the best game in the world. And Rice Lip. London has a county team. They're playing Rice Lip. You've just got absolutely tons of points there, but I don't like it when you get ahead of yourself, so just take one off for good measure, I think. Let's have a quick check-in with the scores. Kath, you are trailing behind, I think, because you've been so angry. I don't care. I know you don't. Stefan, also trailing because you've been bullied. Jake, doing reasonably well, given he hates most sports on 9. And Neil, still out ahead on 11. Okay, question number, I think it's four actually. It was Spotify wrapped this week. When the music app sends out your most listened to music and podcast, blah, blah, blah, and people post about it on social media. I don't have Spotify. Sounds quite arched. It's not Prince Sport, I just don't have it. What was your Sportify wrapped? And yes, that is a great question. And I will give myself a point. Cath. I'm with you. I don't have Sportify, Spotify. I'm technically challenged most days. But I think I'm getting the concept of it because you explained it reasonably well. Thank you very much. Is number one would obviously have to be athletics for me. Hold on. Jake, any issue? Yeah, no, athletics is fine. You sure? Yeah, it's free to wear, isn't it? It's good. Nice. Athletics, busy year, Olympic and Paralympics, of course, meets all around the world. Second, my other sport I work a lot on would be netball by far. Super League matches, international matches for both channels. You've got a problem with netball? You sure? I like netball. You sure? Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's nice to have an arbiter. I like this. You might have a problem with my number three though. I can't see you being an Aston Villa fan. He likes football though. Okay, yeah, but no, Aston Villa with obviously attending matches and being hosting the end of season awards in May actually in interviewing a champagne soaked two and I amory on stage was one of the highlights of my year. He absolutely stunk and you couldn't shut him up. I think we had to you on that weekend. And I was in a really good mood then, wasn't I? You were in a very good mood. Of course I was. You were a good evening all over the show. Sorry, he stunk for what? When we qualified for the Champions League on the actual night of the end of season awards, myself and Jason Mohammed hosted. And the champagne was flying everywhere. They're like Formula One drives. You got Formula One all right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Okay, okay. But no, so by the time he come on stage. It's not a sport. Yeah, exactly, in the environment. So, obviously, once he came on and said, Good Evening, he was doused in the good stuff. That's not going to be happening again this season. Let's be clear. Stefan. Thank you. My grand plan for this year was to get really good at golf. But then I realized that. Golf, Jack? Golf? Me and Jake, it's not. No, you're not sympathetic. I noticed he didn't invite me to the sumo either. And I would have liked to have gone to the sumo, Rick, but I didn't get invited. Anyway, that was my grand plan. But then I realised, wait, I have a two and a half year old and an eight-month-old, so I have small children. So there is no golf happening in my household. So instead, I've spent a lot of time listening to podcasts about sports, sporting podcasts. So I'd like to give a big shout out to those who have kept me going at 3am doing nappy changes, you know, feeds in the middle of the night when you're up at four and they're up for the day. Who gets up for the day at 4 o'clock? Toddlers do. Me every day. And Rick every day. So shout out to the Scrum 5 podcast off of the BBC. Rugby Union Weekly off of the BBC. Big thanks to those too. And then NFL podcasts, Jake, you won't like them. You won't like them at all. Head the call and the Las Vegas Raiders podcast just win. Those are the podcasts that have kept me going in the deep dark hours of the morning. Jake is sort of looking over his glasses like in such a disapproving way, it's magnificent. They talk about all 52 players on the team, Jake. That's what they talk about. It takes a while. 55, isn't it? 52 and then there's a practice squad of between eight players. God, I lost interest even in the question when I asked. 52's not enough for you. No, no, no. You want more. You're more. But, Neil. Neil. Sportify. Rat, please. I've been watching the mighty Arnisslot Mould, Liverpool, in his shiny image. I love how calm he is, I love how he's developing young players. Connor Bradley had Mbapit in his pocket the other night. He might as well have been a young Joey kangaroo sitting in a pouch. He was unbelievable. I'm watching him Mold Gravenberg into a different type of midfielder. I'm watching him experiment with Nunes' medication. It's absolutely fantastic to watch. They are pressing, they're playing possession football and I listen to a lot of football weekly but anything involved in Liverpool this season has been a joy. They're imperious, isn't they? Yeah, enjoy it. Let's ignore this week though. Approval from Jake. And what's your sportifier looking like, Jake? It's going to be Arsenal. Arsenal all over at 1, 2 and 3. Probably watching games, going to games. I even watched the press conferences on the app, which is... Oh, that is boring. It is boring, but I like it, I enjoy it. But does. Does boxing not get in there for you? Yeah, it does. I listen to Five Live, Steve Bunce. Yeah. This is sort of go-to, you get all your information there. DeZone, Bit deZone. Gary Lineka's podcast, pretty good. The rest is football. Yeah, it's about it. Have we got time to do the picture round now? No, I think we're going to, controversially on the radio show, we are going to do a picture round, but we'll do it as soon as we get back after this. That's it for the first half. Some fellas and cagulls are out on the pitch. They're sweeping the surface water off. It's Sisyphian stuff, it really is. We're back after the news and the actual sport. Welcome back to Fighting Talk, welcome back to our panel, Jake Wood, aka Max Branning, Stefan Powell, aka Max Payne, Kaffer Mary, aka Max's Maxx Speed, and Neil Delamere, aka Max's correct answers on the chase. A wuga! Nice to get the wougar in. I haven't heard of the wuga in ages. There you go. Treat yourself. I was like, that should be coming back, shouldn't it? I don't really know when to use it, so just whenever I feel like it. We're on the BBC Sounds app as well. So if you've just joined us on the radio, you can go now and listen back from the start, and you won't miss hearing Kath Mary, basically bullying Stefan. Onwards then, where's my bell? Oh, it's right in front of me. Game changer time. Five points to be won and lost, and it is about this gentleman. I'm extremely proud of my son Hunter. He has overcome an addiction. He's one of the brightest, most decent men I know. And I am satisfied that I'm not going to do anything. I said I abide by the jury decision. I will do that, and I will not pardon him. A bit of a uter by the outgoing US president as Joe Biden has decided to pardon his son, Hunter, after all. But who would you like to give a sporting pardon to Jake? I would pardon Mike Tyson for lowering himself to fight Jake Paul. It's not boxing, is it? Come on. So there's a lot of conspiracy theories out there about whether or not he was trying. I's not boxing, is it? Come on. So there's a lot of conspiracy theories out there about whether or not he was trying. I think he was, but he's 58, Michael. So what was your take on it? It's impossible to say, in it, really. Yeah, obviously just a money grab. Yeah, he's a lot of money. He's 58, isn't he? He's a grandad. It's just, I don't know in what sort of world. That's a professional sport. It's very strange I don't know in what sort of world. That's a professional sport. It's very strange. I don't know how it got commissioned. I should imagine loads of people watched it. Yeah, they did. They made a tonne load of money. So much much. Either him or Lester Piggott. Oh, but Lester Piggott. I think Lester Piggott's too late to fight, Jack Pall. I think they would always make the weight swell. No, but he could do it sitting on a horse. Oh, no. If we're getting a horse involved, you're toasting. As soon as you've got the horse involved, everyone's tuning in. I'm tuning into that. Well, he wasn't expecting that kick. Yes, if he was sugar. This has been done for whipping it too often. I mean, this is a new sport. We're going into business together. If NFL can be played in London, we can put a tiny man in a horse fighting a YouTuber. Yeah. That's what we do. I'd love the confidence, Neil. It's just like we can make this happen. Can we combine it with curling? Can we get curling? Kath. Oh dear. Well, being granted, my pardon is the former captain of Aston Villa Tyro Ming's back from a horrible, and I mean proper horrible smashed up knee on the opening day of our fixture list last year against Newcastle. And I'm pardoning him for a little, you know, game rusty brain freeze when he picked up the ball against Club Bruges in the Champions League and conceded the penalty in the 52nd minute. And no one knows fully what happened because Tyrone's not spoken about it, but Martinez, you know, passed it to Tyrone. We could all see what happens. Yeah, he put it back into the six-yard box. Even Eunie Emery said, look, this is the biggest mistake witnessed in my career. And yes, it's the only goal we've conceded in five Champions League matches so far this season. But my grounds for the pardoning are, he is our former captain. He permanently signed for us in 2019. He helped us get promoted. And when he's fit, he is the vocal brick wall at the back of Aston Villa. He gets grief he doesn't deserve from the Villa fans and has shown this week with his display against Brentford and player the match. When he's on form, he's absolutely superb. And as we're near Christmas and he has fed homeless people on Christmas Day as well, he's a lovely, lovely man. And most importantly, he's my clear favourite of any footballer past or present, so he gets the pardon from me. Yeah, it sounds like you love him, Kath. Right, might have been said. If you've seen her Instagram, she does, look. Yeah, he's all over it. Yeah. I mean her Instagram, she does love. Yeah, he's all over it. Yeah. I mean, he's a nice man. So why not? He was better at HibSwitch, when he, to be fair. Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely. Anyway, I'm not going on enough. No, don't. Let me talk about John Ram. Yes, John Ramm. One of the world's best golfers. And I'm going to pardon John Ramm for deciding to take the cash or 450 million pounds of it and going to play for live golf and have an absolute awful time ever since. Since when he was leaving, he was one of the top golfers in the world. Now he's been described as a competitive irrelevance in the four major golf tournaments. And I think it's really important for the sport to have really good European players. If you look at the legacy of Sevi Ballesteros of Sergio Garcia and all of those beautiful European players that have played, John Ram was embodying their flair, their flamboyance and their love of the sport and now it's all sadly diminished. And a lovely beard smacks the ball very, very far. Oh, so far. So far. He's so strong. Big old lump. But also with a lovely delicate touch when he's playing at his finest. Like the Peter Crouch of Golf lovely, delicate touch when he's playing at his finest. Like the Peter Crouch of golf. Exactly. But he's not playing at his finest because he took the cash he went to play for live golf. So much money though, isn't it? Neil. We've just had our best ever Olympics, pretty much. We won a load of medals, very proud of the Irish team. In 2004, we won one. One solitary medal of gold in show jumping. Keen of Connor won it. Then the medal was rescinded because it was a failed drugs test. So I think 20 years on down the road it is time to pardon the horse. Waterford Crystal was the one with drugs in its system. I think Waterford Crystal had nothing got to do with Waterford Crystal and Waterford Crystal's life spiraled out of control after that. And you've heard of death by Cop well. Constantly in the noseback. Oh, constantly in the nose bag. Waterford Crystal was... You know, Death by Cop. Waterford Crystal was last seen heading towards a Tesco Lazzania facility in 2012. So we never saw them again. I think the pardon's coming in a little too late. I think... No, most pardons are posthumous. They're very effective that way. So I think we just need to just repair water for crystals. I think water for crystal, I think the sires of Water for Crystal, we should get jockeys, put people on Waterford Crystal, and then I've a new sport for them. Me and Max are going to go into business. Have you been sponsored by Waterford Crystal? You're fighting chaos a later. Okay, so it's... Wing in a ton of a half. All right, it's game changer. So I've got Mike Tyson for fighting Jake Paul. I've got Tyrone Mings for picking up the ball in explicatory. I've got John Rahn for taking the live money. And I've got a drugged up horse called Waterford Crystal. Say again. We think it's dead. And I'm going to... Do you know what? Because it was a proper answer, and I do like a proper answer. I'm going to... Do you know what? Because it was a proper answer, and I do like a proper answer. I'm going to give the points to Stefan. Five points to Stefan. Lovely. Where are you going to take them from? And I think this would be interesting because everyone's been having a pop at you. Yeah, well, I think because of... The aforementioned disagreement over the love of NFL. I'm sorry, too. Oh, coming from Jake. Because also, I would give my left arm to have got to see the Los Angeles Raiders in 84. That was them at their pomp, but they were mean and they were nasty and they were the best team in the league. They weren't, but you know. That really hurt, Stefan, because I was mean to him, but you've still taken the points of Jake. You've had trained in trouble. You've hurt him, you've hurt him, Jake. Yeah, sorry, Jake. It was because you didn't offer me the sumo tickets. That does hurt. All right. Next up, Jake. Yeah, sorry, Jake. It was because you didn't offer me the sumo ticket. That does hurt. All right. Next up, with Frank Lampard entering the last chance saloon of football management, which is new boss at Coventry, when all is said and done, which of England's so-called golden generation will have had the best post-playing career in football? Well, it's funny you should mention Frank Lampard because I'm going to say, Frank Lampard, as he says, he's not had the greatest start in terms of his managerial career. He didn't get Derby promoted to the Premier League in 2019. He lost to us in the final at Wembley. That was a great day. Then he went to Chelsea. Then he went to Everton. Then somehow he went back to Chelsea. And now, as you mentioned, Rick, is at Coventry City near me. He just keeps getting handed jobs, hand over fist, doesn't he? So I reckon, when he's going to again be in the right place at the right time, and he is the England manager, we're going to look back in his career and say, I think he's done all right. I can't wait until he's being an English manager. It's going to be fun. They're high-fiving over there. Right place, right time. I quite want to wait for that. He just seems to be fun. Right place, right. Come on. They're high-fiving over there. Right place, right time. I quite want to wait for that. He just seems to be always there, right? Stefan. I'd like to put this into some sort of context quickly. If we can discredit 20% of this person's career, then I think is the right answer. Okay. And that's Gary Neville. Right. And I'll tell you for why, because I think he's one of the most respected pundits in football now. He appears on all the big shows. I know Jake loves a podcast. He's on the big podcast as well that Jake was listening to as well. He's on the overlap and all those stuff. And he's very popular. He is good. I mean, he's respected and he's balanced and I think he's very insightful. Still a little bit annoying, though, isn't it? But all good pundits are, because they get you going, right? They evoke a reaction. That's what a good pundit does. Let's just forget about the whole management thing, because that didn't quite work out for him. But the punditry, he's top of his game. Jake. Wayne Rooney, and I'll tell you why. Are you going to have to? I'll tell you why, because I believe I've mapped it out the next few years. So it'll weather the storm at Plymouth, right? It'll get him promoted next season. They'll get a Champions League place, believe it or not. I love it. I love it. And they'll reach the quarterfinals by the end of 2028. Yeah. It'll get offered the England job after that. And it wins the World Cup in 2030. And Woolgha! So he's going to get it before Frank Lamper? 100%. Sorry. Would you run that for a wait? I say? He said, sorry. Would you rather do you, Lampo? That was a great flight of fantasy, actually. I don't know if a wuga rescues and you said. I think it might. I think it does, Neil. Body of Christ. A wooga. Bristol Waterford, a wooga! Yeah, you'd like to hear it. You would love to hear an awougGA in church, wouldn't you? Just every now and again, Neil. I would just point out the only way you can say Gary Neville is because this show is live, because if this show is recorded, there's a very good chance between, by the time you said Gary Neville and when it went out, Roy Keane would have killed him. Because it's coming. It is absolutely coming. A Wuga! Yes, that is an acceptable place for the movie. Yeah, thank you. Just standing over just prone body, do your job. Awuga, do your job. Because, I mean, he offered out the Ipswich fan. Roy Keene is in his 50s, which means he's never going to stop. Roy Keene is going to be 100, beating people up going to meet me at the hospital at the hospital. I guarantee, put your teeth back in so I can knock them out. So Gary Neville is not an acceptable answer on most other days, but today it is, okay? I'm going to go Beckham because he has made so much money. He turned 25 million quid into 900 million quid. What's better known in a club, a football club or owning part of a football club? Owning a part of a football club in Miami. You can say what you want to Ryan Reynolds, but there's no Wrexham Vice, is there? There's no cool show with John Johnson walking around. Yeah, have you been a Rexham? I take Rexham in Miami every day of the week, thank you very much. Rexham Vice is in Newman Nightclub. That's a different show there. Question is, do you, does money make you happy? Yes! Yeah. Well, hang on, does money make you happy? The Wooga! Okay, let's have a look at the scores, and written beautifully by Tarlyo this morning. They are, Kath, you are trailing on 12. Jake and Stefan, well, there's a little bit of animosity. Tide on 13, lovely. Neil, absolutely flying on 17. Make that 16. Awuga! Now, brace yourself, Jake, please. NFL. And the story of Connor McGowan, whose one million dollar contract with the New York Jets is okay, but it's not as okay as the fact that he's the heir to a 500 million dollar potato empire. So who are the other independently wealthy sports people? The people are just doing it as a hobby. Neil? I forgot to write something down for this, so I'm going to think of an answer off the head. Do you want to wait? No, well, I do. There was a show jumper in the 1976 Olympics called Anne... Sponsored by Christopher. Waterford, Chris, I do. There was a show jumper in the 1976 Olympics called... Sponsored by Christopher. Waterford, guys. Come on. Anne Windsor, who I believe has family money. I believe she had a lot of family money. Really? Flamini, Matthew Flamini, they all said that he was worth a billion quid because it was biochemical company. But that was after football though, isn't it? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, but I'm assuming he was doing some sort of research. He's worth 10 billion, apparently. Yeah, well, I just looked it up last night and the reason I don't have an answer is because it's not really true. So I say, Anne Winser. Okay, I, I, I, I don't think I've ever interviewed anyone who just seemed happier. So judging my last, money does make you happy. I play football. Oh, wow. Kat. It's alleged, and I think it is true having met him on several occasions, and you're a big athletics fan, Rick, so you might actually be able to confirm this for me as well, that the Olympic 100 metre champion in Atlanta, 1996, was the Canadian Donovan Bailey. Oh, yes. And the story is that he was absolutely loaded even before he started doing track and field. Yeah, that's because he only began racing in track and field professionally in 1990 and within six years had become the Olympic champion. But his dad instilled into him the ethic of work and he got a business degree. He was working as a stockbroker when he started training. He was involved in property. He had a really successful real estate portfolio before he became the 100-meter Olympic champion. So apparently he was doing well for him. And then obviously went on to win the fastest man in the world. He picked up a million dollars when he won that 1997 head-to-head 150 meters. He did a lot. MJ still won't talk about that.-head 150 metre race against MJ. MJ still won't talk about that. Yeah, he absolutely hates it. Yeah, MJ pulled up at 110 metre mark the 150 metre raise. Donovan called him a chicken and said, look, let me beat you again. But they got half a million each for doing it and then Donovan picked up the big million G for the win. So he was doing well before he even started sprinting. I did not know that so I appreciate that answer Stefan I'm gonna keep the NFL theme going just for Jay oh just the change yeah so there's a quarterback called Nick Falls who was a hero of Philadelphia Jake they love they worship the ground Nick Falls walks on in Philadelphia he led the birds to their Super Bowl win against the New England Patriots where he was named the most valuable player he caught a touchdown pass as a quarterback to their Super Bowl win against the New England Patriots where he was named the most valuable player. He caught a touchdown pass as a quarterback in that Super Bowl. That is good though actually. Very famous moment. Who's through it to him? He threw it himself. It's called the Philly Philly Play. It was a reverse. He fakes it, everybody got caught out of touch down pass, beautiful moment. Yeah, but how many players could you name in that squad? That's a good question. Moving on. I'm glad you couldn't. Moving on. He's, he's the quarterback, okay? You could have named anybody. Yeah, no, I can name me the centre. Arta Fowler. No, no, I'm not having this. I'm not having this. Pauline Fowler. Anyway, anyway. Martin Fowler. Yeah, great hurling. Jason Kelsey, who people will know whose brother is now going out with Taylor Swift. He was in the team. There were many of the players. Just tell me if the guy's worth some money or not. His parents saw 11 restaurants for 60 million quid. Wow. So his parents were a 60 million pound business. They flogged it and he still went on to be a Super Bowl MVP winner Nick Falls from the Philadelphia Eagles. Jake. Rick, how many players do you know, play for a club, leave the club, set up a business, get more money than they can never imagine. Go back and buy the club. Not very many. Who you got for me? Francis Lee. Yes, it's a big good one, actually. Listen, he played for Man City from 1967 to 1974. That's funny, Lee. And then 20 years later, 1994, he bought the club for £3 million. How amazing is that? He sold toilet rolls. Yeah. There's a need. If it doubts. It's a cost of the need, right? And apparently Peter Kay used to work for his company. His company was called F.H. Lee Limited. Peter K used to work for them. Okay, so you, we feel like, are sponsored by F.H. Lee Limited of the toilet. Your water for Christmas. And something's going on of the toilet. Your Waterford, Crystal. And something's going on with the NFL. But how amazing is that, to play for a club come back? I mean, if Kevin DeBroyon wanted to do the same thing, he would need about four or five billion. He'd need quite a lot of cash. All right, we haven't got very long left, actually. So, on to this. So, I've got to got a script because I've got no idea what this is. It's one for the kids. Happy birthday, Jim Morrison, the iconic frontman, born on this day in 1943. But what are sports greatest doors? Yes, thank you. And I'd like it to be quite quick, please. Jake. Jim Morrison, obviously, you've played his music there. You think he's a lead to sing with the doors. But actually, Jim Morrison is a big mountain adventure skier. He became the first person to ski from the summit of Loxi. No, not the same one. No, no. He skied from the summit of Loxie, the fourth highest mountain in the world in 2018. So Jim Morrison, he goes. I wanted a door, Jake. Cath, give me a door. Sir Don Bradman, nicknamed the Don, the Australian cricketer obviously. He's coming. Wydley acknowledged as the greatest batsman of all time, right? His last test innings at the Oval in 1948, he walked through a set of doors. They have refurbished and renovated these doors with a massive plaque now saying Bradman doors over actual doors at the oven. Yeah, that's much better. Learn from that, Jake. Stefan. For me, it's the fire exit door in your local sports hall. Beautiful answer. They're not supposed to open it when you play favourite aside, but you do because it gets very sweaty in there. You got out there and drink some of your energy drink. Exactly. And they come back in. Imagine the bad sport, those fire exit doors have seen. The badminton, the table tennis, the cricket nets. They stand Sentinel for decades over a bad sport and we should. Have a little vibe, didn't he? Then go back in and I think we should recognise the fire exit door. Yeah, iconic. Love that. Neil. If you didn't like Jake's answer, you're not going to like this one. I've heard a long argument. Ahuga! With the producer that I'm Rick Leport is the finest door. His name is The Door. I'm Rick Lerick. That's his name. He's won the Euro's. He's one of the Champions League. His name is I'm Rick. And if you don't like that League. His name is, I'm a regular one. And if you don't like that one, but I don't like it. Well, keep pressing out of here. La Porta, the president of Barcelona. Now, for God's sake. No, the real answer actually is, I'm reading Andy Lees of autobiography, who is a midwhip boxer, who was a former world champion, and he talks about going to Detroit, moving from London then to Limerick, and on 5555, McGraw Avenue in Detroit, there's a building, two-storied building, more impressive than he thought it would be. He goes downstairs, there's a basement door. On the basement door, it says, this door has led many to pain and fame, and it is the most famous door to any boxing gym in the world. It is the grunk gym in the... Yeah, exactly right. That's a really good answer. You give me a load of rubbish about. I'm Rick Leport. I know, but I don't have enough respect for the whole quiz thing to me. That's what I mean. To start the show, it's something like you had a lot of respect for the quizzes, to be honest. Yeah, real quizzes. He needed a teammate to win that money on the chase. That's all I'm saying. No, if you see the buzz around, I didn't. I like the arrogance. Okay's all I'm saying. No, if you see the buzz around, I didn't. I like the arrogance. Okay, very quick, any other business, please. And I will start with you, Kath. I assume it's something to do with trains. It is. Oh my God. You know me so well. Very quickly, when is it become acceptable to have the whole carriage listen to whatever you're listening to or watching? There seems to be something in the last few months or this year, where nobody has headphones and just thinks that everybody wants to listen to what you're listening to. Do you think you've ever sounded more like a nana? No. Once they told me twice, once they told me twice, I put my headphones up. No, I'm joking. I hate it. All right, Jake. Podcasts, there are too many. There are too many podcasts. Bang on, especially on NFL. There's 4 million podcasts worldwide. I think this is why Liddle has thrived because there's less choice in there. There's less choice. It's psychological, isn't it? There's less choice. You go from what you want, Samaras, get your tomatoes. Stuns. Are you having some sort of... Sorry. Yeah, I don't know. Warout. Waterford crystal. You walk in there. You don't want a whole range of crystals. And yet. You want two crystals and a jet ski. A wuga. Following on from Jake, I just launched a new podcast last week as it happens. That's what I said. So as much as the point is going to say it, my any other business this week, I'd like to call out the production team of fighting talk for not having a single question on history being made with the Welsh women reaching I'm going to say it. My any other business this week, I'd like to call out the production team of fighting talk. But not having a single question on history being made with the Welsh women reaching their first ever finals in history this week. Too soon. They beat the Irish, they've made it there for the first time and we should have reflected it on the programme today. You could have done it. You could have put it in an answer. It deserved the question. It deserved the question. We have put it in an answer. Yeah, you could have crowbar it into an answer. It's too late. Crowbar it in, Stefan. For every bloody answer. I go ahead. The wrong thing. I went to the orthodontist this week, and the orthodontist has all his framed orthodontistry certificates hanging on the wall. And they're crooked! That's not a good measure for anybody. I thought my teeth weren't that crooked, and I'm not going to tell you how mean he was to me but the phrase shanty town of calcium was mentioned. No way. Go on, open it, open it. No, it looks like metal hashtags in there. Oh. Okay. So let's have a little check in with the final scores then. And Kath, you know, you turned up late. You've come last. What's the point? I was asking myself that at 1103, to be honest. Stefan, if you're given an answer about Wales's ladies, maybe it would have been different, but you didn't. In third on 17, Jake on 18, Neil on 21, which means Jake and Neil go into the head-to-head. I think we wanted to be Jake and Stefan, didn't we? But it's not. Defend the indefensible, ridiculous statement. You've got to answer it. However much it hurts. If I say I, I mean you. Who scored the most? Neil scored the most. So you go first. And you've got 20 seconds on the following. I think Arnest Lott should be sacked, as I don't think bald people should be allowed to be football managers. Not only should they not be allowed to be football managers, I think actors as well. I don't think it should be let out. I actually don't think everybody should be, I think Arnyslott should be put immediately on a flight to Turkey, and that's the only way that we're going to do well. I don't like him. I don't like to shine off it. It is distracting. What has Pep ever done? He's a fraud. You see he's already exploded now. Auga. It's the new miracle of Istanbul. Yeah. Fair enough, I can't argue with that. Okay. You've got 20 seconds on the following, Jake. If Liverpool don't win the Premier League, I would like to see Spurs do it. Yeah, definitely. You know, because if I think Liverpool are going to win it, they're sort of imperious, aren't they, this season. But if they don't, then Spurs deserve it because they're a Mickey Mouse team with a Mickey Mouse manager. They've not done much over the last 30 years, and I think their fans need a need a break really. That's it. You could and you could make a nice water for crystal commemoration something or other. Come on, you know how to finish it. Ohuga! Thank you but I'm still, I am still going to give it to Neil. It was a good solid answer. Congratulations, Neil. Thank you very much. Please don't ever see it, you know how to finish it. Oh, okay. I think I'm going to try and say it on a daily basis. Don't. Thanks very much everyone. Thanks for listening. This has been a World Zone production for BBC Radio 5 Live. In the podcast extra, we're going to be ranking the best free-to-wear sport. And is it a dwindling pool? After the news, the Merseyside Derby is off so expect quite a lot of filling from the five live sport team hello and welcome to the podcast Extra of Fighting Talk quite a lot of stuff that we didn't have time for because it was well chaotic but in a good way so let's just get through a few of the ones so first of all we teased it in the first half and then didn't actually do it in the second half, which I think it's poor form. It was the picture round. And so it comes off the back of this. So on the Fancy 606 podcast this week on Five Live, Ali Bruce Ball said, if he finished bottom of the 606 Fancy Football League this season, he would release a photograph of himself in a school rugby team lineup with long, wavy hair held back by a headband. So, I want to see an equally embarrassing picture of you. And the idea was, if you finished last on Fighting Talk today, we'll put it up on our socials. So that is going to be you, Cap. But I'll have a look at them all anyway. Neil, can I have a look at yours, please? That's fantastic. So that is you as a jester. You are about, how old are you there? 10. The beard is coming in. It's about eight or nine, yeah. Yeah, it's sort of, yeah, weirdly prescient, isn't it? Yeah, foreshadowing. Yeah, yeah, yeah. My mother made me that outfit, and she sat me. It looks like it, I'm honest. No, she was a good seamstress. I didn't say she wasn't. She had a couple of points that day. That's all. It looks like it, I'm honest. No, she was a good scene, she was. I didn't say she wasn't. She had a couple of points that day. And yeah, that was part of it. I was paraded around in the back of a float in a Patrick's. Were you doing any jokes? I wasn't. I just shouted a wooga and won for Bristol. Even then, I knew my catchphrase. Stefan, I've ever looked at. Mine's terrible. Because it's just what I had on my phone. So I like the picture of me as a kid in that. I don't have access to us. It's just that. That's you. Trying and failing at something. Yeah, failing to sort out a flat tire. Very emasculating. Yeah. You're looking at it thinking, I don't know how to, I don't know where the jack is and I certainly wouldn't know to operate the jack. My father-in-law had to come and... He did not. He did. He did. That's really humiliating, isn't it? We're clinging on by a threat. Well, that is... I mean, it's not that embarrassing. It's not embarrassing, but I mean, the context is embarrassing. Yes, correct. And we'll build up to yours, the one that is actually going to go out on social media. Jake, let's have a look at yours, please. There we go. That's lovely. So it's a sort of Photoshop endeavor with Jake's face floating in a pool of baked beans. And he is one of the baked beans. Someone created that as a meme because they thought Max Branding looked like a baked bean. So they put my head in a whole load of baked beans. You can't blame it on Max Branding. I mean, it is you. Oh, yeah. We look alike. We look alike. That's lovely. And, Kath, what's going up? There's two there to choose. I couldn't decide which one was more embarrassing, really. Oh, yes. I've seen the one of you in the all-in-one. The alien bodice suit, Lycra. Yes. With, oh, with Christian Malcolm. Yes, that was, basically, it was a Nike all in one Lycra body suit with a hood. So I looked like an alien. It was a photo shoot for Nike. And you can imagine my face when I looked across from Lane 3 in the Olympic final and saw that Kathy Freeman was in it. All one of them. Yes, he's now being used as my most embarrassing picture. So it depends out of you view things, most. And the second one, I'm not really quite sure. It looks like I'm trying to give birth to a brick. That is actually horrible, yeah. It's embarrassing, isn't it? It looks like you've just done the long jump onto the track. Yeah, I think I got injured. Well, it's not my best look, is it? The phrase legs akimbo was invented for it. I think giving birth to something that's not going to go through. Yeah, well, I think we'll probably go with that one. I think we'll probably go with the... Either I'm not bothered. With the birthing one. That's it. I've got no shame. Thank you. So that'll be up shortly. Other things that we didn't get round to, oh, this is very nice. This is long-haired sports person. I can't find what the actual question comes. Oh yeah, it's Jack Stevens isn't it because he pulled Mark Kurea's hair which is fantastic hair and I would give it a tug but greatest long hair among all sportsmen don't giggle it I give it a tug and if you are going to marry was of course Mary is she's a liability she's a liability yeah You are going to at least say a booger. Mary was. Of course Mary is. She's definitely a way for it. She's a liability. Yeah, long-haired sportsman. I'll take yours, please, Jake. I'll go for the rugby union. No offence, obviously. The French rugby union player. Chabal. He was, yeah. He's known as La Hom des Cavern. The caveman. We used up Shabal D. Where we We used up to have Shabal Day, where we would dress up as Sebastian Chabal and go out in university, because he was that much of... He was a beast, wouldn't he? Absolute beast. Incidentally, he's a member of a thing called the Champions for Peace Club, which is a group of 54 famous athletes committed to creating world peace through sport. Can I just say it's not probably going very well, is it? There's some work to be done. Yeah, yeah. Work harder, lads. It's not going too great. Long-haired sportsman, please. You just made me think now of Davy Ginnola, but that's not my answer. And Rude Hullet, how distinguishable, you know, the former Dutch captain for obviously a Wigger indeed, Chelsea manager and player record. Because he was famous for his hair, but many people forget he was famous for the moustache. It was a set. You buy one, you get one free. But I kind of think you could go into a junk shop and get, probably. That's what I mean. So everyone remembers his hair, but forget they had a great tash as well. I would never forget the tash. Yeah, but then he started balding. You know, he had a failed hair transplant as well, which has been reported and he's happily spoken about. So the joy didn't last forever. But while it did... Good looking dude as well. Oh, lovely looking. And most importantly, a very good footballer outside of all the aesthetics. He was mighty good, wasn't he? Well, I'll give him a tug. And Stefan. So in my opinion, JPR Williams, Lions and Wales Rugby Legend, encapsulates 1970 sport in an image. Not only did he have luscious locks that would flow behind him as he sprinted down the sidelines to score tries. He also had glorious sideburns, really thick, big, bushy sideburns that came through to the cheek. Yeah. And it's an iconic look. But also, you know, he played 15. When sideburns were sideburns, really thick, big, bushy sideburns that came through to the cheek. And it's an iconic look. But also, you know, he played 15. When sideburns were sideburns. Yeah, when sideburns were proper sideburns, you know. But also... Martin chops. Yeah, exactly that, right? Yeah, it's sort of him and Gaz from Supergrass are the main ones, aren't they? So he won three glance slams. Two amazing things about JPM Williams, who sadly passed away recently. He won three grandfams, 71, 73, 76. He never lost a competitive match to England as a Welsh rugby international. It's pretty good, isn't it? He retired in 1981, but was still playing until 2003. What? What? Are he still playing? Still? How long was that match? It was NFL. Yeah, exactly. Jake did it. But he'd play fullback, but was the first, when, you know, when the fists were being thrown, he was the first in there. He'd sprint up and get involved. I watched you become more Welsh sure on that. Oh, JP. He was drifting off. I was looking at it because Stefan had just gone off and he was just gazing into... But I think, you know, there are people that can do that to you. Neil. Andrew Agassie? Yes. I mean, you didn't... The hair doesn't have to be his specifically, does it? Does the long hair have to be his? No. Arguably he's more committed to long hair than anybody else because he had long hair, didn't have hair, then had long hair. Yeah. So, and he was spectacular. When you think about... Imagine being the first man ever to win the Golden Slam in singles. So he wins the four majors. He wins the Aussie, the US, Wimbledon and the French Open, and an Olympic gold medal. Imagine being that man and then marrying the only woman in the world has done it eight years before you. Imagine me, any other woman in the world is going well done and your wife is going, it took you long enough. Yeah, and also she's got lovely hair as well. Lovely hair as well, yeah. Eight years ago. Eight years before he did it. 1996, he did it. Do you think of him more than... Do you? No, I think of the headband and the long blondeish hair. And when he first broke through, yeah. Yeah, it was incredible. I think it might be an age thing. Bit like me. Yeah, I think it the headband and the long blonde. The blondeish year. And when he first broke through, yeah. Yeah, it was incredible. I think it might be an edge thing. A bit like me. Yeah, I think it probably was generation. Bit like me when I started on EastEnders. A big. Yeah. And Stacey, it all fell out after Stets. Stacey's fault. It's that hot tub actually. I don't know what they put in the water there, but it wasn't good. Do we want to do the fighting talk rankings quickly? I mean, we can do. We'll just rattle through them just for a bit of fun. If I can find my best of paper, which, to be fair, I can't. Maybe we don't. Hang on, hang on, hang on. Oh, yeah, it is. You look for your paper, I'll get the train to wait. Yeah. Calm down, Kath. Now there's not pointing off, but she's getting even more than that. Oh, it's over here. There we go. Okay, so yeah, so the Club World Cup, so Man City and Chelsea are going to be playing in it, has been brought up by the sports streaming service, DeZone. I hate saying DeZone so much because it obviously should be Dazen, but whatever. They're going to put it out free to wear, so I want to rank the top five sporting events you can still watch on TV for free. Let's just do them quickly. CATH. Hands down the FA Cup. Yeah, it's good. It's good answer. Okay, don't need to. I think, well, hang on. Jake cares more about it than the NFL. Yeah, 100%. Yeah, lower league teams as well. It's a giant killing, man. Yeah, come on. Yeah, it's great. Jake. I'm going to Olympics. Yeah, come on, yeah. Yeah, it's great. Jake. I'm going to Olympics. Yeah, very not, although. Not really free to hear. No, no. There was too much messing about on Discovery Plus. Really? Yeah, there's a little bit. Oh, I'll go snook at him. Yeah, that's, yeah, much better Snoopers in. World Championship snooker, beautiful. And Neil? World Cup final. It has to be the World Cup final. I mean, I know somebody, I know, I'm looking at you, I'm looking at Stefan's going to go, the boat race. And I know there's an argument. I know there's an argument. I know there's people all over the world, people in the global South going, one day, one day, if I put on 17 stone, I can be in with a chance of winning a 50-50 race down a random freezing river in London. Oh, one day! But I arguably, I think more people like the World Cup final, so that's the answer. And Stefan, the boat, right? Originally, I was going to say the Six Nations because it's the greatest rivalry in sport. However, because Jake's you, I'm going to say the Super Bowl. It's got to be the Super Bowl. Is that free to wear? Is that free to wear? Yeah. Is it? Yeah. Because this isn't actually important and it's also the most watch sport in America in terms of... Yeah, the half time is. Numbers. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. MASH. I bet the half time show gets higher numbers than the game. Yeah. Yeah. There have been some amazing. Does the half time show get better numbers than the game? Yes. Does the half-time show get better numbers than the game? Yes. I bet it does. No, I think it does. It like peaks, but I'll throw it. No, no. But if it's peaking then, then yes, is the answer. 100%. Nobody cares. What sort of game is that? Yes, they do? I think a lot of people do, Angelie. Listen, that says it all. The halftime entertainment gets more viewers than the actual game. What sort of game is that? A very popular one that hundreds of millions of people watch it all the time. But the half-to... Beyonce, Bruno Mars. People like music more than like sports. I think if we just sort of gently fade this out. The rapping one with Eminem. We'll continue this at the sumo. Yeah. Well, I'm not invited Jake, so I would continue this in this anymore. I'm serious about the sumo. Yeah, oh yes. Let's have a fighting talk trip out to the sumo. People who don't see this, but Jake has just thrown salt over a shoulder. Yeah. And he's taken off his throat. Yeah. And he won't mind me saying, yes, go on a bit. Mine is, it's disgrace to it, hasn't got mentioned. It's obviously Wimbledon. Yeah, that's true. I mean, I think that is the answer. But again, World Cup final time. In the second week. Okay, yes. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Okay, in no, I think that is the answer. But again, World Cup final. In the second week. Okay, yes. Yeah, yeah. Okay, in no particular order, top five then are of free to air sporting events, FAC Cup, World Snooker Championship, World Cup, World Cup, Super Bowl and Wimbledon. That's five great sporting events. That's your lot for this week. Thanks very much, everyone. Ahuga! See you at the sumo! See you at the sumo! getting together on a new podcast on the Football Daily Feed.
