This podcast is supported by advertising outside the UK. BBC Sounds, music, radio, podcasts. Every day is a chase, every day is a race, and every day you're being overpowered by my base. I'm Rick Edwards, and this is Fighting Talk. talking. Good morning, welcome to the show. A bit of bad news for Lord Coe, if he's listening, Seb. Seb. This is a special enhanced fighting talk. Anything goes. It's a complete free-for-all. The phrase cocktail of drugs barely covers it. I'm handing out gear like I'm driving Lance Armstrong's support vehicle. So who is just about holding it together whilst pump full of EPO? On for the 12th time. The Telegraph referred to her this week as affable, kind, decent and fair-minded. Further proof, you can't believe anything you read in the papers. Broadcaster, journalist, Spurs fans, squash aficionado. And we'll never let this go. Terrible former fighting talk intern, Kate Mason. Hello, everybody. Hello, Kate. I'm a terrible person, but you just don't let me swear. Terrible person? That's what I'm now pushing. That's the agenda I'm now pushing. Okay, well, I bear that in mind as I'm scoring you. Can I say genuinely how much I've enjoyed you on the cricket coverage on mute? Not as in I'm doing the breakfast show. That is how I am best. So I can only see you, but it looks like it's going really well. I'll take that as a lovely, lovely flattery about how great the makeup is. That is, broadly speaking, what it was, yes. Nice to have you here. Now are the panel's least experienced member and possibly fighting talks only mononym. Manchester United fan and United View presenter. Flex, Flex is here. Hello, Flex. Hello, thanks for having me. Good to be back. Good to be back and not virtual. I'm here in real life, in person. I was looking over at you. I thought you were flickering like a hologram, but you are actually here and that's nice. Are you looking forward to the match tomorrow, Flex? Sacrificial Sunday for Manchester United. So, no, I'm not looking forward to it actually. But it is a derby and anything can happen, they say. Yeah, there's a nice trail on Five Live at the moment where it's a couple of Mancunian sort of amping up everything about the game. And it ends with, may the best team win. And every time I hear it, I just think, well, presumably United, I hope that doesn't happen. Making his 70th appearance, the ninth. I know, I know. Ninth most of all time. His debut on the show 17 years ago tomorrow. Wow. Only one of his 15 fighting talk victories has come in the month of March. His very first, which was back in 2008. So he hates March, making him the Julius Caesar of fighting. Ooh. Telegraph writer, affable, kind, decent, fair-minded. Jim White. Hello, Jim. You didn't say that it was me who wrote that about me. I actually, do you know what, I feel good about this March for you, Jim, and I control the scores. Yeah, hang on, I'm just looking over my shoulders, seeing if anyone's stabbing me in the back, but not so far. I think Mills was sharpening something under the desk, so just being a little bit careful. And it is show number 123. Ooh. The noises from Kate are really enhancing things, I think. Fourth most of all time for the next panelist, if he makes Defending Indefensible, it would be for the hundredth time. And we'll put him in very good shape to reach his eighth champion of champions. But he has lost twice to Jim White in Defending and Defensible. It's a huge rivalry developing. Arguably, Leighton Orient's fourth most famous celebrity fan. Oh, let's do the others. A couple of Lloyd Webbers. And then Danny Mays from line of duty. Bob Mills is here. Couple of Lloyd Webbers. In fact, the serious one is unfortunately the one who plays the big violin, not the one with the Dosh. He comes occasionally with his brother, but he's not the one who's a big fan, which is anyway. This is lovely thank you and hey dungarees thank you oh i'm so glad that this non-visual medium gets a chance to appreciate the fact that i've gone dungaree yeah so that's one on one or she said i can i can move to that later depending on how saucy this is okay okay let's calm it down please will someone say something about my cardigan it's beautiful thank you there we how saucy. Blimey, this is, okay, okay. Let's calm it down, please. Will someone say something about my cardigan? It's beautiful. Thank you. I think I wore it last time I was on, actually. Now I wear it for you, Kate. Finally, you've noticed. Let's get going, and we begin with this. Corner is taken in, glanced across. Goal and it's in, and it's Van Dyke who got to touch. The ball's in the Chelsea net, and the Liverpool captain has the goal that Maywell have won it for Juergen Klopp. First silverware of the season to Liverpool as pundit Gary Neville labelled losing finalist Chelsea, billion pound bottle jobs. Thank you Gary for question one on this week's fighting talk. Sports greatest bottlers then, billion pound or not Kate? I'm starting with cricket, not just because I'm bitter that India have now won the test series, but I'm going to talk about their performance in the cricket World Cup final. The stage of set, the event was being hosted in the country, in the biggest cricket stadium, in the world. They'd won all ten of their matches at the tournament. They've got the biggest talent pool, the richest organising committee, over a billion people to pick from. 120,000 fans crammed into the Narendra Modi Stadium and they all fell completely silent as Australia won by six wickets and the Indian Prime Minister had to hand the trophy over to Australia Captain Pat Cammons. Yeah, and maybe rename the stadium. Yeah. Jim, England rugby. They've got more money. They've got more players. They've got more everything except points than everyone else. They've played the rest of the world last Saturday, i.e. Scotland, and managed to bottle it. And I was talking to someone who said, hang on a minute. World Cup semi-final England were great. England played really well. What are you talking about? Yeah, but they lost. They bowled it. In the end, South Africa came past them. England rugby, you cannot play well for a bit and then lose. You're not Manchester United. Oh, Flex is laughing, but his eyes tell a different story. Uh, okay, bottle jobs, please, Flex. Gonna talk about a different United, and that is Newcastle United, 95, 96. Kevin Keegan, hang your head in shame. I'll love it if we beat them. No, it's not harsh. He lost his head. You know, they thought they was going to do it. 15 matches to go. There were 12 points clear on 20th of January, 1996. Eric Canton, our King Eric, came back off suspension as well. We didn't even have him for the first part of it. And the rest is history. Fergie's mind games worked completely against Keegan as his team just absolutely bottled it. And then also that 90th minute winner, the four free in the Liverpool game. It happened countless times. Exactly. It happened countless times. So they had it in their hands. Kevin Keegan got overanimated. He got his team too excited. And they absolutely, I was going to swear then, but they absolutely bottled it. They did. I mean, listen, it still makes me feel, I'm not a Newcastle fan, but it still makes me feel slightly sad thinking about it. Just because I like Keegan. You love Peggy. And now he's got one of the most iconic moments of all time. I hate your mob, obviously. Bob. Well, I'm coming at this from a slightly different angle. I don't believe that professional sports people do bottle it. I think some are just better than others and fitter than others, and it works that way. What strikes me is that the billion pound, but they cost a billion pound, therefore they should be, they shouldn't ever be, you know, below par. And this brings me back to something. I was talking someone about the other night. Money in sport, but money in football. A million pounds. I remember when a million pounds was a lot of money. The first of a million pound footballer was Trevor Francis. You all know that. Brian Clough bought me one in a European Cup. The third million pound football was Andy Gray, who's out of fashion now, but a great goal scorer. The fourth was Brian Robson, great player, and the fifth was Butch Wilkins. I'm really hoping we're going to list all off. It's going to take a while, but it's worth doing. They're the ones that, after that it went up to two millions. The second million pound player, and this is the beginning of people thinking, no, Forrest spent a million pound. If we spend a million pound, we'll be brilliant as well. The second million pound player, Manchester City bought him from Wolves. Oh, hang on. I might get this. No, I'm not going to get it. I'm not going to get it. Well, do you want to remember Steve Daly? No, you don't. No! Because it doesn't work that way. It doesn't matter how much you spend. You can only be successful if you're good. Oh, it's a really good answer because I genuinely can't picture this guy. All right, question number two comes from you the listeners. Lisa Downey is on the line. Hello Lisa. Hi, Rick. How are you? You all right? Good. Thank you. How are you? Very well indeed. Thank you. Now your intro. Any idea what this is Lisa? I need you Lisa like I need a car crash. Ouch. There we go. I'm not really sure what this is. Well it's a track called Lisa and you're called Lisa so it does work by a band called Make Out who our producer likes so there you go. I'll check the mic. What you don't have to. What's... She's so nice. What is your question, Lisa? Thanks, Rick. So, hi, panel. My question is, is the success of the new show Married to the Game, who in sport would you like to be married to and why? Flex. Clarisha Shields. I don't know if you've seen her. She is absolutely amazing at what she does. She would keep me safe. She would also be a massive protector of me. I'm not an alpha male. And I believe that if she had her in my life, I think she'll make me a better man. And if she needed me to do... Yeah. And you know, if she needed me to do things that maybe I didn't want to do, they'd get done. They'd get done. She's a two-time Olympic gold medalist. She's unbeaten in the boxing world. She's an M.A fighter. She wants to go into the men's division and fight the men as well. Clarissa, you have my heart. You have everything you want from me. Yeah, she's absolutely nails. Kate. Obviously the real answer is Loris Carriers. Like, because handsome but also a bit of sympathy, like... No, because I mean, just having you seen him, I'm really shallow. But my more detailed answer would be Ali McCoyce. Ali McCoy's the commentator version rather than the player necessarily, because he's such a good hype man. You know how he's always... He laughs at everyone's jokes, he makes everyone seem better than they are. He just seems like great company. I feel like that's what you need in a relationship. Also incredible good looks. If you could, yeah, actually, can you marry Lois Carris and Ali McCoyce at the same time? What hybrid that is. I don't think I can say the things that are coming to mind. You can't, you can't. But I will officiate the ceremony. Jim. Serena Vigman, she seems very calm, very rational. She'd organised my back four properly. You know, it's been in disarray for a very long time. I have no idea what I mean, I was an awful, awful business. It has been. It has been a shambles, Rick. It's been a shambles for too long. More to the point. 17 years I've been on this show. You pointed that out to me earlier. 17 years, not a hint of silverware. Serena would get me that silverware. She'd get me there. I want Serena. All I've written down those gyms, iffy back four. Bob. I can't answer this question, as you well know. If you've written down those gyms, iffy back four. Bob. I can't answer this question, as you well know. If you've ever wanted to see me performing live, I do stand-up comedy in East Sussex. I can't because I'm not allowed in the county. I'm not allowed to play certain pieces of music on this show, and I'm certainly not allowed, by law, to say anybody's name, okay? Is that it? Are there an answer to come from me? No. Are you serious? You can't? Yeah. Really? Yeah, really. What do you mean? She's got an injunction and I'm not allowed to say her name on the radio. Or his name, maybe I'm talking about Christine. It could be. It could be. I'm picturing you in some lovely sort of purple spandex at the moment, Bob. Right, Lisa, lots of get your teeth into there. Who are you giving the bonus points to? Yeah, some good answers. I quite like Kate, but as an author fan, I feel like I can't really give her the points. I'm sorry, Kate. So I think, and Bob's answer totally through me, so I'm still trying to focus that. I think I'm going to give the points to Jim because I'd really like to see the episode of Serena organizing those Back 4. Thanks very much, Lisa. Remember to check out Makeout. Thank you. Bye. Bye-bye. Thanks everybody. Nice one. As she said, thank you, everybody. Just fade it straight out. Yeah. Can you make the point of makeup as the name of a band? Not that you can see her and she looks a bit mascara and lippy. Can we get her back on? Can she be one of the rest? Can we bring her back up? It will be, which is perhaps I have another question. This is the next question. It will be the longest Formula one season ever, with 24 races, the expansion that literally no one asked for, all begins today in Bahrain. But will you be following the Grand Prix season? And even if you aren't, give me a storyline that will ensure that I do. And, you know, from a legal perspective, let's try not to mention Christian Horny. Bob. Do you know what? I've taken your challenge because to me, the Formula One season is like, oh, so which cars are going to win this year? Which are best guys? Who spent the most money? And that's it. I find it so, so boring. You're doing comedy this year, aren't you? Yeah. I find it so, so boring. You're doing comedy this year, aren't you? Yeah, he's going to win, he'll be third, he might crush, see in about two hours. But I took your chance up because I saw an article by Martin Brundtel, who I remember was a good racing driver, and he was talking about Lewis Hamilton has moved from Mercedes to Ferrari. But next year. Yeah, yeah. So he's racing with one, but I wouldn't let him anywhere near my car now if I was going to say, no, you're going to, you're going to Ferrari. But next year. Yeah, yeah. So he's racing with one, but he's, I wouldn't let him anywhere near my car now if I was Mercedes. No, you're gonna, you're gonna prang it, aren't you? You're gonna have a bit of fun with it, aren't you? But the point he made, Martin Brundall, was that in 1992, he was driving for Benetton, in the knowledge that Ricardo Petrazi, and I'm reading these names, was already signed to be their driver for next year. And he said, it doesn't matter if you're a world-class Formula One racing driver or you're a shelf stacker at Aldi. It's the same stinky, horrible year you're going to have when you know that you aren't going to have this job next year. And he said, I found myself looking across the garage in the pit lane thinking, what are they talking about? It's not involved. What's going on there? Well, hang on a minute. What new clutch pedal? No one's told me about a new clutch pedal. And I think, and I don't know if you've ever, I've been in a situation where I was doing the job that I knew I wasn't going to be doing in another month. And it stinks. Also, nice to do Ricardo Petraezi get a mention. It doesn't get many mentions on this show. Not enough. No, Jim. It's exactly the same drivers in exactly the same cars. There's been no change whatsoever. It's Groundhog Day, the same bunch going round. And that means Match for Stappen is still at Red Bull, which means his dad, Josh, is still dressing up in the Red Bull uniform. And apparently he and the person we must not mention for legal reasons, who's involved in Red Bull. I think he's their boss, isn't he? I think that's where the real story's going to be. It's Max's dad against whoever that bloke is. Yes, and we will never know who that bloke is. Kate. It's too much. I won't be watching. Do you think I could get into it? You're looking at me like I probably couldn't. The only thing I do do related to F1 is I listen to the Fast and the Curious, which is an excellent podcast. Oh, it's good. It is good. I don't know, because it seems like, as you're saying, you kind of get the idea and I feel like actually that kind of meta way of watching sport is well, it's not the future. It's current, isn't it? Yeah, Lewis Hamilton's going to Ferrari next season, so I'm quite interested to see what happens with Charles Leclair this season. I'm just trying to work hard here to show that I really respect the competition. And you, I respect your cardigan. I'm a great girl. Flex. Firstly, it's not what I'm going to go with, but I just want to say, I wanted to see, because I don't watch Formula One I think it's Nath but there you go and everybody says I can't wait to go to be in the stands and see the cars go around every eight seconds and hurt your neck I'd rather go to Wimbledon than do left the right with my neck rather than that but I wanted to see a season where every single car is the same every single car so it's not about I'm a great driver but I've also see a season where every single car is the same. Every single car. So it's not about I'm a great driver, but I've also got a great car. How about we just make it a level playing field, same engine sizes, same tires, same everything. And then let's have a go at that. You know what you're talking about there, Flex, a period of time that was known as the good old days. The good old days. Just put us all in the same car. That's it. Like Mario Kart. When you go play Mario Kart, you have to choose the CC. We all agree to it. Yeah. Is it 150? Is it 200? So it's fair. Then whoever's the best driver will win. But the story that would make me watch it this year is if it was guaranteed that Lewis Hamilton will win. Because they robbed him a couple years ago. And I want him to get one up on Mats Verstappen, even though I don't care about F1. So we've had four very long nose. Next question. St David's Day was yesterday and in the absence of any of the panel wearing comedy daffodil hats or drinking brains and just because stereotypes are always better in three singing in choirs, who is the greatest ever Welsh sports person? And there are some bonus points available here for the correct answer which I have jotted down don't you peer at it Kate start with Jim please Jimmy Murphy I think he was mentioned on this show a couple of weeks ago in reference to Manchester United and what he did there and staying on with Munich and so on but actually it's what he did with Wales. He was manager of the Welsh national team from 1956 to 1964. He got them to the quarterfinals in 1958, just six months after the Munich air crash. They only lost one nil to Brazil. He then went on while he was assistant manager at Manchester Night and a manager of Wales. He was offered the job to manage Brazil, Juventus and Arsenal and he turned them all down. All at the same time. All at the same time. Well he could do two jobs when he was at Manchester Night he could do Wales as well. He could have done all three but he turned them all down. What a great man. Fantastic. And good answer. Flex. I was thinking Craig Bellamy, Joe Allen, people like that. But I've ended up at Gareth Bale. Yeah. I've ended up at Gareth Bell because he did it all. And he's got, what, four Champions League, which is absolutely incredible. He was an instrumental part of those Champions League. He wasn't a bit part player. Some of the goals he scored on that run. And I tell you what, when you talk about what he done for Wales, which maybe this is the bit that Ryan Giggs doesn't quite tick, he put them on his back. He carried them. Two major championships as well. And the semi-final that he led them to as well, that was never supposed to happen along with, I don't know, Rob Sin Cano. Just how? He's probably another contender for the greatest ever as well. I think he'd be surprised to get a mention, actually. Kate. Definitely going to go him. Yeah, I don't know, Rob Sincarnia. Just how? He's probably another contender for the greatest ever as well. I think he'd be surprised to get a mention, actually. Kate. Definitely going to go. Yeah, I didn't go for Gareth, though he is my favourite sports person in the entire world, probably. Because I feel as though the answer needs to be from the national game. So my answer is Shane Williams. 87 caps, 58 tries, about 10 more tries than anybody else. He's my height as well, which always pleases me. And the only person who... That's a mad criteria. Just be the same height as me. And he's the only... I mean, I've cried it a couple of the John Lewis adverts, but I don't know, you guys must have seen the Guinness advert that they did about him. 87 caps, 58 tries and too small to play rugby. Oh my God, it makes me cry every single time. Same height as you. Bob. Well, that's fabulous. I'm impressed by all three of you. But Kate, I see your 58 tries. Jim, I see your World Cup quarter final. And Flex, I see your four Champions League. And I put down 11 Olympic gold medals and six London marathons. Tanny Gray Thompson, born in Cardiff. That's a great answer. Yeah, but who watches the marathon, though? How much views does that get? Who's tuned into the marathon? I get the sense that you don't watch anything long. No, too long, too long. You know, what was the performance like at that matter? Do we know? None of you got the bonus points because the right answer was, of course, Colin Jackson. Absolutely savages. The scores then tied in third, Kate and Flex. Oh, you amazed me. I'm so surprised. All right, Kate. Jim on 16. Bob, as ever, leading the way out on 17. And the next question is all about this. Burbank throws a dummy. And he sets it up. England are only 10 out. And they come to the left. Faye Waboso, what a try. And England are back in it. There's that spark. And it's a first test try for a manual, Faye Waboso! What a try! And England are back in it! There's that spark. And it's a first test try for Emmanuel Faye Waboso. So big week for England rugby union winger Emmanuel Faye Waboso. scored a try against Scotland last weekend, then travelled straight back to X to uni for his exams and then had to miss England's Six Nations training camp as a result. What is the most annoying reason you've missed out on a sporting occasion, Bob? Very quickly. Early 2001 when I had a career, ITV2 had just started and I was hosting a show of them called Don't Mention the score because for some reason they'd managed to get the rights to the Bundesliga. So me and Alan McNally sat talking about players and teams we couldn't even pronounce, never mind we've seen. But they said to me, you know there's the last game in the Olympia Stad is being played, England playing Germany. Do you want to go? And I said, yeah, and they said, we can get your tickets. You'll have to pay for your own flight. And I thought, no, I'm not doing that. Because I had a gig on in Robberham. So I did that instead. I missed England's 5-1. Yeah, but it's an unremarkable game really. Yeah, he'd miss nothing, Bob. Jim. Yeah, I was going to talk about the fact that I did my back in on the part run and couldn't go to Spurs against Brighton the other week. More your back four problems. People were probably quite keen to miss that game. But you said something when we were chatting before the show about your dad's incompetence, and it reminded me of my own. Clarify that but yeah okay. My own calendar incompetence. I actually bought some tickets for the first ever. This shows how old I'm more than anything else, 2020 again to take my little boy and his mates to and I looked in the paper to see what time it started and there was the scoreboard. It's been the day before. Perfect. It's great dadding. Flex. A couple of seasons ago, Manchester United beat Manchester City at Old Trafford, which was fantastic. It doesn't happen that often in a lot of fixtures. And you know when you're on the motorway and then there's loads of traffic and stuff, so your ways or whatever your sat navv is will direct you somewhere else. i follow it thank you i'm still going to make it on time stuck behind cattle cows for ages ages and there's no one leading them as well i don't know if you've seen like if you've waited there's not there's no one in charge of the m6 have you gone well well he's what's ways this mate i didn't know where it was. Chestwell through Stretford. It gets like that on market day. Unbelievable way. And I'm looking around for some sort of order. These cows don't pay road tax. They're not meant to be there. Who's in charge of this? I just walking alone, alone, alone, alone. And then I basically got there just before the end of the first half. And we was already winning and I missed it. I'm annoyed. I think you've disrespected the cows. I think they've got as much right to be on that road as you add. Kate. I was in Qatar working for two years between, oh God, I can't remember, 2017 to 2019, I reckon. Yes, that makes sense. And you may or may not remember that Tottenham got to the Champions League final in that season. I do remember that. And for the semi-final, of course, as it started to feel like maybe we're going to get somewhere, I started trying to quiet tickets, you know, what's the point of working in sport if you can't get to games that are important to you? So I'm lining up this ticket for the semi-final, because I hadn't managed to get anywhere with the second leg, hadn't managed to get anywhere with the quarters. And I was on the brink of leaving Katta. I was about to finish my job and go. And what I didn't know is that you can't leave the country. have these these labor laws i don't know if anyone's heard about this anyway you can't leave the country before you've um the final day of your contract otherwise they you don't collect all your money to get out the country so basically i had to stay in katar and watch it in a cafe with my arsenal supporting friend trapped in k in Qatar. That's a real shame. I forgot to give you any points, sir. There's no. Time for us to, it is really, yeah. Time for us to have a breather. And you mainly to reflect on how terrible the world is because we'll be back after the news. Hi, my name's Eddie Hearn and this is no passion, no point. I'm excited to be back with this new series. As always, I'll be talking to top performers about what drives them, how they gain an edge over competitors, and whether their dedication to constant improvement comes at a cost. I love golf, I play it until my hands bleed. I just enjoy going out there playing with no fear. What makes them feel fulfilled? It's not the money, it's not the trophies. It's the friendships and the memories I've got. And does that change as their career progresses? Just a girl who grew up playing football, and now I'm getting pets, like, without even seeing the camera. Like, it's crazy. From BBC Radio 5 Live. No passion, no point. Listen, whenever you like on BBC Sounds. Hello, welcome back to Fighting Talk. Welcome back to our panel, Kate Mason, Flex, Jim White and Bob Mills. I've been flicking through the Fighting Talk annals and genuinely nothing worth talking about, but I've got a bit of time here, so this genuinely is just filler. On this day in Fighting Talk history 2nd of March 2019 5th and to date last appearance of Clive Anderson 9th and to date last appearance of Danny Mills Greg Brady was on for the 161st time and in the midst of the longest windlass streak of his fighting talk career Clive Anderson may defend the indefensible for the fourth time in five shows lost for the fourth time on that occasion to Mina Rosuki If you missed any of the show, you can listen from the start right now by searching Fighting Talk on BBC Sounds and, as a bonus, you can probably skip over that last bit. Game change of time, five points for one of you, none for the rest. Maison and I used to have a music radio show because you really wouldn't listen to this. Liverpool players celebrated their League Cup win with a sing-along of their adopted Duolipa hit One Kiss. And I would like your suggestions of songs for others to celebrate too. I think maybe the thing to do here is you tell me the song and then I try and guess who it's for. I don't imagine that'll work, but we'll give it a go. Jim. This is not a celebration. It's a word of warning. Taylor Swift, you should have said no. Okay. Is it Chelsea, the Chelsea board should have said no to signing Cicedo and Fernandez? That's not a bad answer, but I'm not going to give you any points for that, Rick. Let's move on. No, it's Jubei fans to Paul Popper. He should have said no to that doctor who gave him those pills back then. You've been fine. Oh, I'm giving out lots of points because I'm excited. I'm not allowed to because it's the game changer. Flex. Soul to Soul. Back to life. Talk to me. Who's had a Lazarus moment? Amazing song, by the way. Oh, what about Tom Daly? He's going to come back maybe for the Olympics. It's not Tom Daly. Decent guest, though. I didn't even know he's going to come back for the Olympics. I'll give myself a point. I'm allowed to give myself a point. Who is it? It's for my beloved Manchester United, actually, because every time I think we may have turned the corner or we may be in the ascendancy, something happens that just reminds us all the time. You are nowhere near it yet, and Sir Jim is here, but it's still going to take a lot of time. So it's always back to reality, and I felt that at Old Trafford against Fulham. It should have been Tom Lockyer. That's what I should have guessed. That would have been a really good one. Kate. Do we play it? Don't know. Oh. Yes. Do you know that? I mean, do you know this one? I don't know any songs. We've got Teetay fans in the house is what I've noticed. Genuinely, I don't know any songs. This is Love Story by Taylor Swift. Okay, yeah. And you're going to guess. Oh, okay. So who's having a pair of romance at the moment? Um, I don't know, you're going to have to tell me. Oh, guys, come on, after her reboot of the NFL. Stop hitting the desk. Kansas City Chiefs should be going out after they're winning the Super Bowl, thanks to Taylor Swift's romance with Travis Kelsey. They won it before when she wasn't even there. Yeah, yeah, yeah. She's made it happen. She's just jumped on the bandwagon. That's really stopped doing up your hands. It's really root one stuff. No, I honestly think you're better than that. I do. I honestly think that. All right. Well, you're wrong. I'm in Lake Norant support. We've been in League 1 or League 2 forever, it seems. We've always had a local rival, and we were talking about this. Not long ago, was Barnett and they're out of the league now. Even more recently it was Brentford and they're now in League 1. We've got a new rival in League One. The O'Mayette. Charleston? There you go. Very nice. Struggling desperately to avoid the drop into the fourth division. That's the most excited. The Bob has looked all show, actually. He's really pleased for yourself. Okay, five points. So, I mean, obviously obviously kate out the question uh flanks i think there was a better answer for yours i think i'm going to give it to jim come come in to jim hey jim right see the serena viedman and i'm getting close to silverware there you go all right uh next question everton have had their 10 points deduction for financial fair play breaches reduced to six. That lifts them out of the Premier League relegation zone. So, by my reckon, there's a spare four points sort of floating about who you're going to give them to and what difference will they make. Flex. I'm going to give a big shout out to San Marino, the international team. Yes, come on. Because they have never won a competitive game in their existence. They last won against Liechtenstein in 2004 in front of 200 people. So I would love to give them these points. How would it help them? Well, it's four points. So that's a win and a draw. So it would be jubilation in San Marino for at least two nights. And hopefully that will help them qualify for a major tournament. Well, they get absolutely humped. I wanted to do a documentary about San Marino so I've spoken to a lot of those guys out there and they would really appreciate it. They would really appreciate it. The documentary, not the fictional version. Tell me. About the American Samoa team. No. The worst football team. You would love it, Kay. I would love it. It's really good. I would absolutely love it. That's your homework. Thank you. Yeah, team. No. The worst football team. You would love it. I would love it. It's really good. I would absolutely love it. That's your homework. Thank you. Yeah, it does feel quite schooly in here today. Yeah, it's because I told you off for hitting the desk. And you're wearing dungarees. And leaning back on my share. Okay, I'm sending the points of the Bundesliga to give them to buy a Leverkusen. It's not because I'm remotely upset about Hurricane leaving Totnam. I just need a little bit more time before I see him lift a trophy and obviously Without you. Yeah. Without me. And they're eight points clear but it's the Bundesliga by Munich always win. So I think if we just had those four extra points for Leuhausen, I think it would I'm hitting the desk because I'm such a rebel. Yeah, and that is one of the most vindictive answers to you ask. Bob. I'd like to give it to my hometown team, because they're in that terrible position at the moment where I think they're fifth in National League North. And if you know anything about the playoffs in the National League, the third, fourth, fifth and sixth play, all the ninth-tenths, it's ridiculous. It lasts for about a month. And it's too strenuous. I think if I gave them the fourth point, Chester, I'm talking about, I gave them the four points, then they'd be guaranteed at least second or third place, and they'd only have to play one playoff game. Jim? I kind of, you know, I don't want Citter and I don't want Liverpool to win the league. So I was thinking of Arsenal. Can't give it to Arsenal. So that's obviously ridiculous. So I'm going to give Liverpool to win the league. So I was thinking of Arsenal. Can't give it to Arsenal. So that's obviously ridiculous. So I'm going to give it to Luton. And for this reason, I like going to Luton. I love the Kennelworth Road. But my wife has no interest in football whatsoever. I mean, how we've managed to keep together for this long. I'm watching a Luton game the other day, watching the telly. She comes in and she goes, oh, football. And she looks at the telly and she comes in and she goes oh, football. And she looks at the telly and there's a picture of Rob Edwards on screen. Hello. Is that he me? Who's he? So four points for just having a handsome manager. Okay, next up. Jake Knapp was a bounce at a nightclub two years ago. On Sunday he won the Mexico Golf Open which came with a oneouncer at a nightclub two years ago. On Sunday, he won the Mexico Golf Open, which came with a one and a half million dollars first place prize and a spot in this year's Masters. Meanwhile, Joe Dean won a life-changing prize of 170,000 at the Kenya Golf Open a few days before the tournament started. Dean was working as a part-time delivery driver for a supermarket. So this is a good chance to ask for other sporting rags to riches stories, Bob. Rags to riches. Everyone's pain deserves the claim, all right? Everyone's story is valid. But let me tell you one thing that I know for certain there can never be a rags to riches story in the world of golf because you cannot play golf in rags because they have a dress code. You turn up in rags you ain't getting in the club. It's as simple as that. If you want to be a rags to riches or you've got to start off at a certain level. You want to be poor. Be poor in Cameroon. Be poor in Cameroon where the only job for an 11 year old is working in the sand quarry. Not even rocks, just making big lumps of sand for people to take away. So Francis Angano, all right, there's a rags to riches story right there. Not golf, all right. I couldn't afford a full set of titlice. Is that how you say that? I've never heard I don't think it is. I think you might be trying to... Titlis sounds wrong to me. I think you might be trying to... Titlisd sounds wrong to me. I think you might be trying to smuggle something into this ballcast. How dare you? Let's just go around and have a go. How are you proud, sit Jim? Titleist, isn't it? No idea. Flex. I have no idea. No idea. No idea. Kate. Titty lice. I didn't want to say that. Oh, that's much better. We'd better come of you. In a carry-on sort of way. Okay. Okay. Flex. I'm going to go with Maurizio. Sorry, but actually it's a richest to richard story because he used to work in the bank. That's not what I've asked for. He's only ever played an amateur level for a local team having had trials in Torino. He worked as a banker that saw him travel Euro. He worked in London, in Zurich and Luxembourg. And Sari used to work in a bank in the morning and trade and play games in the afternoon and gaining employment with a minor league side in 99. Where are you reading this from? This is all fact. No, you just read it. I've got this. No, no. I've got it. I've got it. I've got it. I've got it in my answer. All right, all right. And then he's managed to win in Italy. He's managed to win, you know, in Italy. He's managed to win with Chelsea. And really, he doesn't really have any form of pedigree in a professional game. And he stands on the top sign smoking. No pedigree and no rag. Yeah, I mean, no rags is the key. It's kind of emotional football rags or something. Yeah, okay. I'm going to give you a sympathy point actually flex, because I think that Bob nicked your answer. He did. But I think you might have changed it in the last minute, did it? No, I didn't. No. Jim, I was about to bang the table. Well, it's this season. Madesden United. They were bust in 1993, homeless. And then this season, they have not only transformed the FA Cup, they made it really worthwhile, they've been fantastic. What a great story. They've made 450 grand out of their FA Cup run, so it's them. It's George Olegoby. You know. What a nice man, George O'Ollicoe is now. What a lovely man. He's had a good guy. He was a vicious defender of the Orient, but he's a lovely man. Yeah, and my dad likes him. Classic wolves man. Kate. This is such a lovely story about another security guard called Shamar Joseph, who is a Western Indian cricketer, who decided to focus on cricket full-time about 18 months two years ago. Before that, yeah, he'd been working in security. And he took seven wickets in that test against Australia at the Gabber to win their first test against Australia in Australia. It says 9097. And yes, I did just hit the table. Thank you. Okay, the scores, Kate and Flex. I mean, languishing, languishing on 22 apiece Bob on 28 here's arch rival his nemesis jeer mountain 31 talking about yourselves now two Manchester United fans on the panel so it is with great delight that the next topic is about this. Fulham on the counterattack, he's got options here as Treyori. One of them is Iwobe. Iwobe in the area. Iwobie! Fulham are back in front, right at the end. Alex Iwobie has secured Fulham's first win in Old Traffat in 21 years. I Wobie! I loved it. It was reported that some members of United's losing. Secured Follins first win in Old Trafford in 21 years. It won't be! I loved it. It was reported that some members of United's losing team last weekend had the audacity to ask for Monday off a reward generally given to winning teams by the Gaffa. But who will definitely be at training on Monday as in who's going to get a beating this weekend, Flex? I'm still salty about this and I'm going to say it's going to be Fulham. They're going to need to ask for Monday off because they're going to play Brighton. And after TikTok gate, after they were so disrespectful to the establishment of Manchester United. Come on. Did you actually think it was disrespectful? Did you think it was quite funny? I thought Eric Tenha was so embarrassing. Just leave it, mate. The cottages have come and Nick free points of us. Like, just leave it. And they did a good tweet or whatever. Exactly. This is why they call it the free regimes. Yeah, they haven't won there for 21 years. But back to my point, they are going to, Deserby is absolutely going to destroy them. They're going to lose 5-0. And Alex Owobie and the likes of William and Paulina, they're all going to want to not come in on Monday and I hope they have to. They're really upset. Sorry about talking about Fulham just makes everything bland. Kate. QPR are going to get finished by Lester. They may have won their last two league games. Lester have lost their last two league games. Lester are good. QPR are bad. They're going to absolutely kill them off. Also, can I have, because I haven't got any points, can I have also a special mention for another team in La Liga as well? Two answers. One question, aren't you lucky? Amaria, winless in La Liga, and they're facing Saldivago, 17th place. That'll be 15 points off the bottom if they, sorry, 15 points from safety if they lose, which they're going to. Give me two answers just a bit desperate. Oh, yeah. Bob. I was lying when I said a like to. Two answers ago, things can only get better for Charlton. And I hadn't realised, of course, that two questions later, this was going to come up. And I was going to see, oh, they're terrible a way for them. Charlton are going to be working on, working hard on Monday, because Northampton are going to beat them by at least three goals this weekend. Jim? It's Manchester United again. They're playing Sitter, that on tomorrow. And when you play City, there's 115 reasons why you ain't going to win. A point for that, but I will not comment on it. All right, quick one. We learned this week that former Germany and Arsenal forward Lucas Podolsky is now worth over 177 million pounds after building his own business empire from a chain of cabab shops and his own brand of ice cream. So what are we going to ask, sports people as components of a kebab? No, sports people as ice cream flavours. Please, panel. Start with you, Jim. Well, I was going to say vanilla for the entire Formula One grid. Rocky Road for Eric Ten Haag. But actually... These are all good, actually, Jim. I'm going Raspberry ripple, which is the colour that would have been on Billy Bremner, Norman Hunter and Johnny Giles' face if back in the day, they were obliged to play in the away kit that Leeds wore at Chelsea. Pink and Lemon. They're like Sherbert running around. But I quite like it. I thought it was quite fetching. That's exactly why Norman wouldn't have worn it. No, he wouldn't. Me and Norman would never have seen eye to iron anything. Flex. I feel a bit bad for this guy, actually, but I'm going to go with Andy Murray, and he's just going to be the wafer at the bottom of a 99 flake. Just a cone. I think vanilla would be too strong. I think mint chocolate chip, rum and raisin. He couldn't handle it. Because I'll be honest. This is a guy's one grand slams. I know, and that's why I feel a bit bad because in a different era, he would win a lot more. I'm sorry that he had to be around when Federer and Nadal and Djokovic were around. But like, when he wins, I just don't think he's happy. When he's explaining other things, I just don't think he's happy. When he's talking about coming back from bad injuries to come back and play again, which is brilliant, I just don't think he's happy. So he's talking about coming back from bad injuries to come back and play again, which is brilliant. I just don't think he's happy. So do you think that ice cream cones aren't happy? Well, I just think Andy Murray is. It's a disrespectful answer when it's a joke. And I've asked for ice cream flavors, he's just got cone. It's just a wafer. But the good thing about that is actually quite interesting because, you know, depending on how you eat your cone, sometimes you bite the bottom of it off and, you know, you can get the ice cream out and that's actually quite exciting. So maybe that's what Andy Murray is when he's the cone. Yeah, trying to put a positive spin on something, which was definitely negative. Bob. Being relegated, certainly, from the top division, is a terrible traumatic thing. He might happen to loot and Sheffield, you know. Teams will go down. A lot of teams, they'll go down and they think, well, we're here, we found our level, we'll regroup. If you're a big team and youffield, you know, teams will go down. A lot of teams, they'll go down and they think, well, we're here, we've found our level, we'll regroup. If you're a big team when you go down, if Everton go down, which they may well, with their history and their bill and their new stadium and coming, it can be a really, really, it can be a rocky road. I think I'll just about give you a point for that, Kate. Because I didn't get to talk about him in the previous, one of the previous answers about Welsh people. I got to, it's compulsory. I've got to mention Gareth Bale in every single edition of Fighting Talk. So he is Ben and Jerry's fish food because it is the best flavor in the world. It's fish food. You're not familiar with Ben and Jerry's fish food? You know, yeah. Oh, sit back everybody. Just you wait. You've seriously telling me. You've had fish food. You've had fish food? You know, yeah, that's, I mean. Sit back everybody just you wait. You seriously telling me. You've had fish food. You've had fish food. You guys know fish food. Oh, everyone else knows. Spelt with a pH, obviously. Spelled with a pH because it's fat. You would have had it. It's like little chocolate fish. It's shaped like fishes in chocolate ice cream. I don't think the plural of fish is fishes, by the way, but yeah, carry on. All right, sir. Shape like fishes, there's caramel, there's chocolate, there's vanilla. I can't just describe this ice cream. I'm sorry, I can't. I'll give you a point to shut up. He's the best, he's versatile. He's full of unexpected surprises, Gareth Bale. And I miss him when he's not in my freezer. And take an off. All right, let's have a quick look at the scores. Kate, you will not be surprised to hear that you're languishing down in fourth. You've got 25. Flex 28. Bob and Jim, it's pretty tight. Bob on 33, Jim on 35. Talk amongst yourselves. Don't sing amongst yourselves. Any other business then? Jim, what's on your mind? Yeah, I don't know if you saw Bradley Cooper is getting a lot of hate because he is spending a lot of time promoting himself ahead of the Oscars. Is he? He's doing loads of interviews. He's just everywhere. And he's just trying to push himself and his film Maestro as much as he can. Have you seen the film? I haven't seen the film. You can really feel him pushing himself there as well. He's really just like, please I want the Oscar. Please God, I want the Oscar. Anyway, Rick, I thought that the next time this panel convenes on fighting talk, I think you should insist that everyone does their bit to promote fighting talk. So they have to go out there and really push it. So, you know, Bob's got to be on the cover of GQ. Flex has got to be on Graham Norton. Kate's already okay because she's got a national prominence. And if you could turn the sound up when she is delivering the... Only if she promises to talk about fighting. She could say... Enough from the cricket for the score. I'm on fighting talk this coming Saturday. As for me, I'm sorry, I won't be, because Serena's looking after me back four. That is a textbook, any other business there. Bob. My favourite any other business is the ones that just suddenly occur. I'm afraid it has. Oh dear. Heaven's for fend I should ever be accused of pedantry. But in fact, the plural of fish, as I'm very confident about it, it's absolutely valid because it's not just one type of fish. If you have two cod, they are fish. If you have a cod and a trout, they are fishes. You're absolutely right, Bob. But in the fish food, under discussion, there is just one type. I don't think there is. No, I think it's a little round one. There's not a little round race. How many, how many? No, that's not, that's just a blob. That's because you know Kate didn't mean that. Stay back after class, Rick. How many types of fish are there, that's not, that's just a blob. That's because you know Kate didn't mean that. Stay back after class, Rick. How many times of fish are they in that food? Multiple fishes. Absolute nonsense. Absolute nonsense. I will, it's not the hill I expected to die on, but I'm going to. Flex. Mine is something quite annoying that people tell me is fact and it's science and you can't argue with it. But leap year hype. It's not real. Mine is something quite annoying that people tell me is fact and it's science and you can't argue with it. But leap year hype. It's not real. In what sense? It's not real. Some people say, oh, I was 40 the other day, but really I was 10. And I'm like... No, really, they're 10. They're still at school. Pick one. I just, to me, that day was the first of March. Whatever day that leap year day was, that's not real. You know, and then they said, oh, it's 2.5 and 2.5 and 2.5, and to me, that day was the 1st of March. Whatever day that leapio day was, that's not real. You know, and then they said, oh, it's 2.5, 2.5 and 2.5, and then again, that makes an extra day every foot. No, they're making stuff up. Just leave it as it is. The 1st of March comes after the 28th. But I was about to propose to you, Flex. Well, then you should have done it on the 1st of 28. Listen, we've already missed a massive opportunity. Lex, we've only recently met. We're not what I'm a friend, but we're a colleague. You've got to come to my house. Because in my kitchen, I live on the Thames Street, and in my kitchen I've got a tide clock, which tells you the time, presuming that the day is 24 hours and 20 minutes long. Lovely. Which is what the time sequence is. It would blow your mind. I don't think folks can handle it, actually. Honestly, I just think the leap here is the biggest load of rubbish I've ever heard. Okay, well, there we go. This one has also just occurred to me as we were discussing fish food, because my main bug about fish food is that it's five quid normally, but it's $3.50 when it's on a deal. Yeah, the deals are good. The deals are good, but I want to cancel all supermarket deals. Because what happens is I go in to get, you know, pasta and whatever normal stuff for dinner. And I come out, as I did yesterday, with four bags of hot cross buns for 58p. And I don't like hot cross buns. Just because it's a steel. It's an absolute steel. 58P, you can't argue with that. But isn't that a you problem? You've got to have more willpower. I was hungry. I think it, I think Flex is right card. Isn't that a you problem? You've got to have more willpower. I was hungry. I think it, I think Flex is right. I think it is a you problem, Kate. All right. Let's have a look at the scores. Who thinks Kate has come last? Yes, yes you have, Kate. 27. I put my hand up and everything. Flex and now slam it into the table one last time. Flex in third on 30. Clash of the Titans at the top though. time. Flex in third on 30. Clash of the Titans at the top, though. Bob on 36, Jim on 38. Jim and Bob go into the head-to-head. Defend the indefensible. You know the drill, obviously by now. Ridiculous statement, you have to answer. Doesn't matter how much it hurts. If I say, I mean you. Jimmy, you'll wake. Yeah, good. Let's say it genuinely looked like Jim was having a nap. He's a different year. I'm trying to build a bit of excitement here, Jim. I will call Serena. Okay, Jim, you scored the most points. You go first. You have 20 seconds on Manchester United must go and re-sign Paul Pogba immediately. Well, just think about it. I know he can't play because he's been banned for four years, but just think about the hairdressing opportunities. Just think about Graham Sue Ness. I know he's not on the telly anymore, but getting wound up. All we need to do is MUTV, put a camera in his hairdressers every week, and the world will get more and more irate. Oh! Sort of weird end to that. and the world will get more and more irate. Oh. Sort of, it's like weird end to that. Jim having that sort of his internal monologue dripping out onto the radio. Bob, you have 20 seconds on. The start of the Formula One season is always the highlight of my sporting calendar. The start of the Formula is very much the highlight of the sporting calendar because there are very few occasions where I can sit in front of the telly, sit there and take the kids, shut up, don't interrupt me for the next three minutes. Let's see who crashes. Because no, when they're first starting off, they're not going to get really badly injured, but they're going to try and take the lead and there's nothing like that better than a pring. Not a motorway disaster, a prong. I don't think you needed the caveat. I don't think anyone was thinking. I'm a terrible man. I think, I don't know really, it was fairly... Well, he repeated an answer he did earlier in a show. Oh, hang on. Hey, both of you settle down. Can I just say? No, okay, flex, you win. By a weird default, very well done. Congratulations. I think you should win. Sorry, for a world that is going mad at the moment with wars all over for saying that the leap year is, quote, the biggest load of rubbish you've ever heard. Come on. And he's our winner. Congratulations. The rest of you just go home and think about what might have been. This was a World's End production for BBC Radio 5 Live and now after the news, it's 5 Live Sport. Hello, you're listening to the podcast Extra of Fighting Talk after a, well, I mean, a horribly chaotic end to the main show where Flex unbelievably went away with a victory. It doesn't feel like a proper victory. It does. Although you've celebrated it. He's a man United fan. Don't do that a victory. It doesn't feel like a proper victory, though you've celebrated it. He's a man-united fan. It's the first time I've ever been given the win. It's the first time I've ever been given the win. Yeah, it was a good. And it's just a clear win for me. This is a big deal. I'm going to tell everyone about it. Does that mean we have to send the champagne back if you don't think it counts? Yeah. That Flex has already ordered to. You can have a quick sip and then it goes back. It doesn't matter. We've heard it on air, mate. I was declared the winner. Yeah, you were. Here's something I wanted to talk about and we didn't have time to, which is the 800 metre runner Guy Leermont. Did you see this this week? Didn't get selected for the world indoor athletics and took it, I mean really badly. He said, this is an amazing sport that's being killed off. He said they're crushing athletes' dreams. They're ruining careers and physically, emotionally and financially breaking human beings, not athletes, but humans. And it made me think which sport is the worst run? And I think it's quite a crowded field. Do anyone want to have a crack at this? I thought you were suggesting that as a reaction that I should deliver on losing and coming last again. Well, you can also do that, yeah. Perhaps I'll do that next time. I can only up in advance. So the thing with him was, he was narrowly beaten in qualification, but because he's from, it's slightly complicated, because he's from Scotland and the games are in Glasgow, World Athletics said you can take, you can take one more. They said you can invite him and British Athletics decided not to, which is quite mean. And he's really, like he's really upset about it because it would have been, it's probably his last games as well. He's probably going to retire. So he's absolutely gutted and I think he's got, you know, good, good reason to be. But a lot of sports are terribly run. The only thing about sport, I know, I don't know anything about sport. I used to work on sports broadcasting, but I was just the guy in the corner being funny now and again. But I spent quite a lot of time talking to coaches of academies. And I think the turnover rate in academies is, I had no idea how terrifying and viciously is that you can be you can be at club that Steve what's his name I forget? Steve Daly no no Crystal Palace was saying you'd have kids at five parish so no name of Steve come on this can be good round five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve gone finished nothing you're not, eleven, twelve. Gone, I'm finished. Nothing. You're not doing it anymore. What do you mean? I'm not doing. No, you're not possible. That's it. Thank you. We don't need you. Go and see if you can catch up on your schooling. Yeah. I'll go and play the Sunday League, which is my other big bug bear, the football's grassroots. Grassroots initiatives. You know what grassroots means? Football academies. Well, they don't even have grass. It does not mean park football. You know what grassroots means? Football academies. Well, they don't even have grass. It does not mean park football. Oh, what? Park football gets nothing. Well, that's why you're annoyed because it gets nothing, or you mean it shouldn't. Oh, right. Yes, because it gets nothing. So kids who aren't quite good enough to get to an academy benefit not one penny from the trickle down and all the money that's put it to. So what happens? You know, there's this like initiative about getting lots of girls to play football that the FA have been on about. Yeah. So is that just magic money? That's girls, I think. That's giving them facilities to play. But unless they reach a certain point. I'm with you. They won't get any money. Then it's, no. Nothing comes of it. Bob's absolutely right. One of the most depressing and sad. I'm with you. They won't get any money. Then it's, no, nothing comes of it. Bob's absolutely right. One of the most depressing and sad assignments I've ever had. And boy, you know, this is not, as I had to do, Brighton Wolves the other day. This is really genuinely sad. It was, every year the PFA does a match where everybody who's been kicked out of the academy at 18 goes and plays a match in front of scouts from other places. And by God, that is awful. Because you know, you get a kid up front and the ball comes to him and he miscontrols it and you can just see 100 scouts just going. And the other problem, of course, and this, you have to be very careful what you say here because you start standing racist and jingoistic, would you not? Oh, Christ. It used to be the, you went to the academy. It was a distancing, within a mile of it and two miles. And you had to be the best player in that and then the best player. And it's still the same, the best player in there, you've got to be the best player. Until you reach, I think it's 15, when now the rest of the world is involved now you've not got to be the best player in sully hull or birmingham you've got to be the best player in the world at that age that's who you're in competition with and there's loads of players who even get to older than that which is even harder so say you go through all your schooling and schooling and your GCSEs and then you finish college and you're on YTS and then you get a pro. You've never been anywhere near the first team and you know you've bossed it in sort of under 20s football maybe under 23s released. Nothing. And then, you know, it's so difficult to make it even through the leagues, league one lead two. Then before you know it, you're playing sort of conference and down and before you know what you're playing locally. Then it's like, I just need to go and get a job. But I've never done this before. I don't know what this looks like. I've got friends who have dropped through the league. And it's like, I don't know what it is to work. And I'm like 25, 26. The only upside of it, the only upside I have to say is that teams like Lake Noreum, we've got loan players who, we've got loan players from Fulham from Man United from Sondland real players who in a real world should be actually playing for their reserves and trying to get their way into but they're not they're labelled not wanted on voice because we've brought so many more players in it's easier to buy than it is to nurture so the the loan market in the lower divisions is sensational. Yeah, you get some good, right, genvina. You can just transform it. If you've got a slick manager with connections, like fortunately we have, you can bring in real class. What is fascinating is how these academies, some of them seem to be run. Like they are just sort of a manny's dog and a two-bit operation. And you just think it's incredible to see how ramshackle it all can be when it's in the middle of, you know, the best football league in the world and England and we've got all of this stuff. But you're right about it feels like maybe if we just go and set up a, should we go set up an academy? Is that the conclusion of this conversation? We'd have to be nice to everybody. We have to say. No, but we could delegate that out conclusion of this conversation? The five academies. We'd have to be nice to everybody. We'd have to say. But we could know, but we could delegate that out, couldn't we? I'd enjoy giving the players points though. Yeah, you were. And taking them away. Yeah, absolutely. That's a fair throw. Can I put another sport in there? Yes. Boxing. I think boxing is the most obvious. It's an absolute shambles. I just, I do. You want to try and find, because I'm not one of those people that are closed mind is the most obvious one for me. It's an absolute shambles. You want to try and find, because I'm not one of those people that are closed mind is the things evolving and becoming something better and bigger and technology and money and stuff like that. But what's going on just with the basics of like the best, never fight the best? Like they're shirking each other, there's excuses, there's breakdown in communications. The promoters don't want to tour. The fighters are arguing over the purse. And like what we're saying, it's like, back in the day, you know, the best would just fight the best. And you hear fighters say this like, I'll fight anyone. And it's like, just take that term now out of boxing because you won't fight anyone. Whenever you're supposed to. Also, when you do get the fights, it's at the wrong time. It's like four years after you wanted to see them fight at their peak. And also the governing bodies, oh my goodness, from if a fighter maybe gets banned in this country, but you can go and get a license over there, and there's a little loophole there, and this border control has different sanctions to this one so there's you can get just what has gone on with that sport it's a mess really horrible to see because it's a fantastic I really enjoy boxing always have but you just sort of see it now and you're just like what is it should be a really pure sport exactly like it's a really straightforward thing yeah it's technically sort of beautiful. Athletes, or boxers want to fight. Exactly. And, you know, these people are putting their lives at risk every time they step into the ring, you know, male and female. And it's like, at least get the bits around it right. Because it's such a high risk sport, well, dedication, what you've got to do to actually be a boxer. I spoke to Eddie Hearn this week and asked him about the lack of atmosphere in the Saudi fights. And he was like, yeah, yeah, but it's new there and it'll evolve and they're kind of learning it will get better. And I was just thinking, I don't know if he believes that or if he or if he cares. But I just can't, I can't see it personally. I can't see how you ever going to generate the same kind of atmosphere that you get in. It doesn't seem like it. It's like some of the fights. And again, you don't want to sound like you don't want other places in the world to benefit from what great sport boxing is. But there's something uncomfortable of like 90,000 at Wembley just isn't being adhered to walking out and like 8,000 in silence. It's like, that's just not the spectacle of like the pinnacle of heavyweight boxing with big knockouts and the atmosphere is is part of what makes top level boxing. Mind you they've achieved it in the Saudi league for football. Yeah, so true. Jordan Henderson found it too intense in the end. The ultras, the Saudi altruists. The naughty 40. All right, well we'll leave it there and it was pretty depressing, so thanks everyone. Grab your VIP pass. We're delving into the secretive world of Formula One. Behind the scenes with two of the sports biggest names, Mercedes and Williams. This is not coal mining, this is Formula One motor racing. As they build their new cars, we want to be so much further ahead, and face shocking headlines. Here's Lewis Hamilton moving away from Mercedes.
