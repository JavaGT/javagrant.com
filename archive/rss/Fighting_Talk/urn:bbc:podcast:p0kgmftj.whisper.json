Quick point of order before we get on with things. You have until midnight on Monday to say your Happy New Year's. After that, you must stop saying it. Get them all done, get them out of your system. Thank you. Also, I am delighted to tell that the first fighting talk of 2025 is brought to you in association with Michael Owen saying Brazilian Ronaldo again and again and again. There's a liminaldo. Bezoluminaldo. Bezoluminaldo. Pazilminaldo. Pazilminaldo. Can't really explain why I like that, but I do find it really funny. So who has braids the cold palmer conditions to be on our new year opener? No, actually. On for the fifth time, and having been on exactly once each in 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024, and 2024. It could be a while before we see her again. England and Queensland netballer lawyer. Always good to have a lawyer on standby on fighting talk. Ebony Osoro Brown. Hello. Hello. How are you? I am fast after Christmas and New Year's. Okay, okay. I was worried about the pause. I thought you're going to give me some quite deep there. I am, do you know what? I'm not massively happy with that. Legally speaking, can I bring any sort of action against anyone who wishes me happy New Year after Monday? I wouldn't advise that you do that. Okay, yeah, fine, Just no, don't take legal action. On four show number 74, late replacement two shows ago, helping us out in a crisis, rewarded by coming last. In fact, yet to reach the final in three attempts so far this season and had a winless 2024. Still, he's a 15-time fighting talk winner, ranking the top 10 all-time in victories and appearances. The Thinking Man's Jim White! You really wanted the Brazilian Ronaldo, didn't you? Ideally, ideally, yes. But you've stepped in again. Jim, do you think you can turn this form around or is this an inevitable and irreversible decline? Have you lost the hunger, Jim? Sorry, are you talking about me or the club of support? A bit of both. Oh, right. Okay. Yeah, it's all gone for me. I'm past it basically, is what you're suggesting. Thanks, Rick. And a happy new year to you. Well, you've got it in in time, so I don't mind that. Making his seventh appearance, first of the season, on tour in March, bad luck, Guilford, Bromley, Colchester and Chelmsford. Sold out. But once you get a bit further from the M25, loads of tickets. Big in Essex and neighbouring areas. Spurs fan, Josh Jay. How we doing, Rick? Yeah, I'm good. How are you, mate? No, yeah, thanks for bringing to my attention. I'm not that popular up north. No, but listen, down south. I know. Yeah, I know. London and the home counties. I'm absolutely cleaning up. north. No, but listen, down south. I know. Yeah, I know. London and the home counties. I'm absolutely cleaning up. But, yeah, a bit of stugglers. Is it worth it? Well, I did, I did suggest it, but I don't think they're going to have it. You've got to persevere. You've got to win them over. Yeah, you got win them over. Yeah, although Manchester's nearly sold out, which is a turn up for the book. I don't want to hear you bragging. Before every, before every show, just as part of my extensive preparation, I obviously combed through all of the panellist's stats. And this is what I found. In three shows under Colin, you won twice, you average 45 points. Under me, you are zero from three, average 35. Have we got a problem? Are we cool? Well, I don't know. I just think Colin was a bit nicer to me. It's not helping you. Usually, you build up to the big guest. Not on this show, though. On for a 12th time. Last time he reached defending a defence wall. He lost to Jim White, brackets, thinking man's. I mentioned that because the atmosphere when these two arrived this morning, genuine tension. It was absolutely electric. I didn't know if you're going to fight or make out, and I still don't. Former Radio One Extra guy, host of Jacksonville, Jaguars UK on Sky. According to his bio, generalist, according to us, Fullum fan, Chris Parkinson's here. You called me a polymath last time and made me sound so smart. Yeah, well, a generalist, what you say. Which is a highfalutin way of saying, Jack of Oldclosed Master of None, is this? Yeah. Now, the thing that we've got to mention is as soon as I saw you this morning, I was like, this was creepy, though. It was creepy. No, it was creepy. No, it's not creepy. And I felt uncomfortable, Rick. No, no. You are wearing exactly what you wore the last time you came on fighting door. Have you got a fighting talk uniform? Same boxers as well. It's incredible, but down to the shoes. Yeah, same shoes. Trousers, top. I only wear it when I come here. Hopefully clean. Look, I'm really, no, no, well, after he's one, doesn't wash it. Yeah, yeah. That's the way it has to be. Well, it's nice to have you all here. Let's get on with this. The first question is all about this gentleman. He will be in towards Mope. Brilliant by Mope. What a sharp turn now was by Neil Mope. Got it out for the league of his feet very, very quickly. Right footed. Everton's first shot on target in the game brings a goal. And Neil Mopee with his first goal on target in the game, brings a goal. And Neil Mope, with his first goal for the club. And I think last goal for the club. Neil Mope, the Marseille player currently on loan from Everton, went on social media this week and said, whenever I'm having a bad day, I just check the Everton score and smile. Who else's sporting misery always puts you in a much better mood, Jim. This is quite specific, I'm afraid, because it's always been the case. But then for the last, what, 15, 10, 15 years, I've not had much pleasure in this. It's, it's Manchester City. And I tell you, there's one specific I've got on this, is that United States is doing so badly that they're clearly going to be in the bottom three at the end of the season, right? My dream is this, that United a third bottom, right? And then the Premier League finally come to judgment on Manchester City and their 115 alleged, obviously, because they deny it all charges and give them such a hefty points deduction that they end up one place below Manchester United and go down instead of them. And that will give me, you know, such joy. It would be beautiful. Do you think it will happen? I don't think so. I guess what I'm hoping is that United finish second bottom, right, and both Manchester teams go down. Yeah, yeah. And I get myself a point for that. That'd be very good. That'd be very good for where you work, right? Because when you go to work in Salford, there's going to be a lot of people thinking the same, I would know. They're so happy at the moment, all of them. Josh. Well, look, I think misery's a bit far, but I do enjoy watching Eddie Hearn getting the better of Simon Jordan on Talksport. During one of their infamous debates. I do listen, I listen to Talk Sport a lot, and I listen to Simon Jordan. Yeah, I prefer Colin, don't worry, mate. But I do listen to Simon Jordan. I think that you, you know, I do think Simon Jordan, are you really that clever, or are you just saying a load of big words that blokes like me don't really understand, you know? So, when I, you know, are you really that clever? Or are you just saying a load of big words that bloke's like me don't really understand, you know? So when I listen to a good football or boxing debate, I want to do so without having to look at a dictionary or for soros or any of these ones, you know. So, yeah, drop me out, Simon Jordan. Yep, Simon Jordan. Not for me, actually. Reese. I used to have a good impression of Simon Jordan. What? I can do a good impression of Simon Jordan. Go on, them. And, yeah, Josh, you, um... What, what, what, do, what did, what did you, um... What, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a business. One of the Crystal Palace. Once was the Crystal Palace. I understood. The, uh, business. What? That's great. That's really good. That's really good. He's Nick to load more points than you are from your answer there, Josh. You barely need an answer, basically. Whose misery makes me happy? Yes. Simon Jordan. No, I'm a Jacksonville Jaguas fan. This is a weird thing about... America has many weird things, I think. I think that's safe to say. One of the things are strange is if you're bad in the season that you're having in NFL, NBA, you then get rewarded with the best player who's coming out of college in the draft. So even though I'm a fan of the Jaguars, this season we're 4 and 13. So we may actually get the number one pick in the NFL draft. So as long as we keep playing bad, we could get a generational player who's basically the next LeBron James, well, the NFL version, called Travis Hunter. That man is unreal, and we may land him in Jacksonville. It's just a good. The draft is such a good system. I do love it. It's amazing. Ebony. Mine's got to be Novak Djokovic. Obviously last of one of the big falls between him, Roger Fedro, who I thought had an amazing class, Raffa and Nadal. But Novak Djokovic, obviously last year at Wimbledon, he's not the greatest loser, but every time he comes out and has a good performance. I still made me laugh in terms of in the arena. He just lost a match as well and I think he was unhappy about that. All right, question number two comes from you. Listeners who have posted questions on our social media this week. Hello to Marcus Sprinkle. Mark, see you there. Are you there, Marcus? I'm here, okay, good, good. Now, Marcus, I'm going to say right off the bat, I really like the surname Sstrengthle, both written down and saying it, Sprinkle. So much so, I looked it up, and apparently it is a nickname for a lively athletic person from the middle-low German, Sprinkle. So much so, I looked it up, and apparently it is a nickname for a lively athletic person from the middle low German, Sstrengel, meaning grasshopper. So your name is effectively Marcus Grasopper. Oh, I didn't know that. There you go. I'm here to help. What's your question, Marcus, Grasshopper? Okay, well, panel, I learned a couple of interesting facts about 2024 in sport. The first is that in 2024, Jack Greelish scored zero competitive goals. And secondly, when Kate Link Clark got drafted for the WMBA, the Indiana fever, they sold more shirts in 24 hours than the Dallas Cowboys had sold in the entirety of 2023. So, panel, please can you give me your great 2024 sporting facts? Okay, it was quite a long window, but we got there in the end, Marcus. Josh, best fact from 2024. So, best fact from 2024. I mean, the year of the 2024 was the year of Luke Littler, really, is he introduced himself to the world stage of darts and racked up more than a million pound in prize money securing premier league and grand slam titles on his first attempt he had uh i think it was around about 800 180s he had five nine darters um now obviously it seems to be the obvious choice but surely you know one of the years most astounding sporting facts is that he'd done this at just 17 years old his birthday this year he's not until the 21st of January, so he still can't even buy a beer yet. He's probably still knocking about on a provisional, and he's just a kid, really. So, you know, it's got to be little littler for me, and he's age. That little green pea. Reese. I'm going the opposite. It doesn't matter how, I don't care if you're young. I more care if you're old. 57 years of age. Kazioshi, Kazu, Mayora is playing, was playing last year in the Portuguese second division. He's gone back to Japan now. 57 years old and still playing. If you are 57 right now, you have no excuse not to be a professional football. That includes you, Mr. Sprinkle. Anthony. not to be a professional football. That includes you, Mr. Sprinkle. Ebony. Obviously, 2024 was about the year of the Olympics. Another highlight of that was Reagan, the breaker. And the fun fact that I found out was that she was ranked. Number one female breaker in the world following the Olympics, according to the World Dance Sports Federation. So apparently the ranking events leading up to the Olympics but not including the Olympics had created a set of unique circumstances that she found herself as the world best breaker and I just think given the entertainment that she prewaters she's got to be the best fact for 2024 I just I can't I can't do any more of her. Jim. In 2024, something happened that had never happened before in the history of English football. After the general election, there was only one of the 92 football grounds in the league, which is in a conservative constituency. So there's only one. i'll give you two seconds to tell me which club it is one two is no no no no no no it's bromley they are the only only club that the ground in a conservative constituency after last election and don't come back to with full i'm not liberal democrat i'm not i'm not coming back to him with the full of... Liberal Democrat. I'm not coming back to you with anything, Jim. I trust you. Mr. Grasshopper, can I... I don't want to lead the witness here, but one of those is an absolutely superb fact, and the others aren't. Who are you giving the points to? Well, whilst I am 56, I would love to think that I have got one year left in my sporting career, I have to give it to Jim White because that is a brilliant fact. Yes, you do. Absolutely right. I didn't need to lead the witness. Thanks very much. Have a good day, Mr Grazopper. Bye. Thank you very much, Mick. I think it just called me Mick, but we'll move on. I was calling it a Grasshopper. You've got to take much Mick. I think he just called me Mick but we'll move on it as I don't know. I was calling a grasshopper. You've got to take a Mick. You've got to be fair. Right. Question number three, Thomas Tuchel, or as Bob Mills started calling him last week on fighting top, Tommy Tuckle. So this week, work starts here as he got his feet under a table at the FA. But what should be the New England Boss's first job in his first week, Ebony? To get it in writing that he deserves a knighthood, even if the Tim don't go on to win anything. I don't think he'd be eligible. We can find Sonnyk for him. Josh. So I think you should get their teams to say a big thank you to Sir Garif Southgate for changing the nation's expectations of their football team. I mean, some have been critical about Garif receiving the night. You know, some people say it's rewarding, rewarding failure. But let's have it right. Before he turned up, you know, we were hopeless. Hodgson, Capello, Aladais, they'd all let us down. Aladais played 1-1-1. Well, he's got the best ring ratio. I'll give you that, Mick. But, yeah, but before that'll give you that, Mick. But yeah, but before that well-spoken man from Crawley come along, give us a little semi, we couldn't, we were useless. We were absolutely useless. Give us. Don't, don't, don't, don't, we all heard it, we'll move on. So I big make you to go of. Jim. Well, he's at Spurs, Newcastle in about an hour. He's what he was doing. Jim. Well, he's at Spurs, Newcastle in about an hour. He's probably there already, isn't he? So, obviously, learning how not to defend from the start is what he's going. But actually, I think what he really needs to do is learn the words of the national anthem. Because if he does, that's going to shut a lot of people up. Yeah. I mean, if there's one thing that agitates people inexplicably, it's their manager not singing. Reese. So, Jim, we're related to this one. I know he was around then. So, you know, back in the 1940s, there was a lot of things that happened, but there was probably a lot of funny business that went on as well between certain people in certain countries. So, I want to Carl, Tle, to go through German centrebacks, especially, and left backs, right backs, their family lineage and see if there are any chance that we could recruit some for England, because it happened against us with Nusiela. So we're going to go trawling for Germans. You've got a little bit of heritage. Yes, I don't care if it's your great, great, great, great, great, great grandma. I think it's a good idea. And they're blooming tall, aren't they? Okay, let's have a quick check in with the scores. Josh, no surprise at all. You are trailing dismally on four points. Ebony has seven. Jim on nine. Reese out ahead currently on 10. Talking much to yourselves. Jim on nine Reese out ahead currently on 10 talking much yourselves I don't think you'll make it to double digits today Josh I'll be honest question number four then okay panel first weekend of January so where are you going for some FA Cup? What? The FAA Cup third round is next weekend so we'll be asking that next week. For now, what else in sport do you know is happening but you're just not entirely sure when, Reese? Formula E. Yeah, yeah. It definitely does happen. Yeah? Don't know where I can watch it. I'm aware it exists. Good answer. Does it? It does. We all know that it exists. Good answer. Does it? But it does. We all know that it does. Formula-y. You just assume... Actually, no, he can't be presented it anymore. I'm not going to go down that, really. Josh. So, I've gone for the inevitable sacking of Lopatagu at West Ham or Postercoglu at Totten. I mean, both these teams just as bad as each other at a moment. There's no sort of bragging rights in this rivalry. It seems to be a race to the bottom. And whoever wins has got the illustrious name coming in of Graham Potter. So loads to look forward to both West Hamers first. Who do you think goes first? I do think it's the West Ham guy's going to go first. Yeah. I think they're going to stretch it out a little bit with Big Ange because you've got injuries and that. But I do think the writing's West Ham guy's going to go first. Yeah, I think they're going to stretch it out a little bit with big ang because you've got injuries and that. But I do think the writing's on the wall in as well. Jim, we don't know who's going to be in it. We know that Reese Parkinson's Jacksonville, Jaguars won't be. But I'm looking forward to the Super Bowl, simply for the fact that the half-time is Kendrick Lamar, right? The half-time is Kendrick Lamar, right? The half time is Kendrick Lamar. Jim's a Kendrick Lamar fan. No, I'm not a Kedricelmaher, please. Rees, just listen for a change. Will you please listen? The reason why Kendrick Lamar is a great choice is because he's got 15 minutes of the world's attention just to diss someone else. It's just a vend's got 15 minutes of the world's attention just to dis someone else. It's just a vendetta. 15 minutes of vendetta. He's the rat Neil Mope, Reese. So it's great to have him on and that's what we need. How is Jim aware of the Kendrick and Drake beef? That was not on my bingo card for 25. Oh, but it was massive though. But Jim? Hang on. Hang on, Reese. Why would I not be aware But Jim? Hang on. Hang on, Rhys. Why would I not be aware of it? No reason. Thank you. Jim is across every hip-hop beef of the last decade. Absolutely. I'm there. What's your other favourite one, would you say, Jim? Anyway, let's move on. Ebony. I was going to say, the London Marathon. I think I watch it every single year and I'm always, I don't know if you're a bit like you guys. I want to do that next year. I want to set that challenge. I'm going to wear a costume. I want to raise money. And then I'm like it comes down every year and I still haven't done it. I still haven't signed up. I don't actually know when it is up until it's on the TV. It's early April I want to say. Yeah, but it was October at one point. So. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So it's now moved again. But I'm never aware of it until it's actually happening. If you were going costume, what are you thinking? Big dinosaur. Big dinosaurs, good, Rhys, what are you going? Well, my fighting talk out. Yeah, of course, yeah. People who are like, the guy from fighting talk. Josh, fridge on the back? I was good actually say a washing machine. Yeah, nice, mix it up a bit. Yeah, because I'll clean up. Just wash a machine or a washer dryer? Just a washing machine, sure. Jim. Obviously, I'm going as Kendrick a bit. Yeah, because I'll clean up. Just wash a machine or wash a dryer? Just a washing. Just a washing machine, sure. Jim. Obviously, I'm going as Kendrick Lamar. Yeah. Please don't do that. You'll get tabs. Do not do that. Right. Question number five. Raise a lot of money. He went to. Raise something. On Monday, dance player Rob Owen was due to be working and delivering for a frozen food retailer. Luckily, his mate Derek covered for him so he could play in the last 16 of the world. Sadly, he lost to Callum Rids. So, and I'd like to be honest here, when have you skipped work in the name of sports? Josh. So I've wasted hours of my life and days off of work, scyving off of work for the PC game football manager. I really have. My missus caught me. She called me a couple of times. And she caught me in bed the other day with my laptop out. And she saw what I was playing. And then she went mental, you know, she went mad. She said, you told me you had a headache and I said, well, yeah, a selection headache. So, yeah, it's, it's, it really, I've had to block it away, you know, I've had to chuck away the game because it's... Are you not on it anymore? I'm not on it anymore. No, I'll go to... That must have been tough. Yeah, it has been tough to take a... But I'm in sort of like a fellowship of we all meet up and we all talk through, you know, trying to give up football manager. So, you know, that's what needs to be done. I'm Josh James and I'm a recovering football manager addict. That's exactly that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's a heartbreaking story, actually. Jim. Yeah, fortunately, most of my life, working life has been involved in sport. But the other week, a friend of mine was in a syndicate for a horse, so I went to watch it, and I just assumed everybody at work. I'm getting on a bit, as Rees has said, they probably aren't interested in my take on the Super Bowl. I thought, I didn't think I would tell anyone. So I went to Southall to watch my mate's horse, and I got a call after the first race, I think, to say that Ruben Amarin had been appointed and could I write 800 words? I didn't on my laptop. I'd be on the phone. And by the way, my mate's horse fell at the first. What did you? I mean, 800 words is quite a lot of words as well. Were you just dictating it? Were you just sort of speaking the piece? Yeah, no, I wasn't. I was typing it in. I wrote it down and then typed it in. I see. Types on his phone. Very modern. Reese. So, not work, but school. Yeah, I'll allow it. I'll allow it. Primary school. 2002, I was eight years old, and I think it was at 9.30. 9.30 a.m. was the kickoff between Brazil versus England and the Japan. Was it Japan and South Korea World Cup? Yes. Yeah, it was. Yeah. Japan and South Korea World Cup. And there was no form of me going to school. However, I found out that they were actually showing it at school, but I still begged my mom to stay at home, only to see David Seaman be humiliated by Ronaldinio. Oh yeah. Was it a cross? Was it a shot? Was that the Brazilian Ronaldinhoio? Just want to check. Yeah, hang on a minute. It wasn't him. Yeah, that was, I remember exactly where I was some dingy little bar in South London watching that. So pumped up. Yeah. So, so disappointed. Yeah. The war came. Horrible stuff. Ebony. So when I was an athlete, I can't really remember a time when I wasn't skipping off work to go and play sport. But I think the pinnacle came probably in 2022. Clearly, I spent, well, had my baby in 2020. So I spent a year of maternity leave. Came back to my legal job. And after three and a half months, I was like, any chance you'll give me a sabbatical for eight months to go and play netball in Australia and then play in the Commonwealth Games. So luckily, a supportive employer said yes, but it was a bit of a cheek, I think, after three and a half. I'm just like, yeah, that is. I mean, I'm three and a half, yeah, three and a half months being back in the office. But they obviously recognized I was good enough, and they let me do it. The value, the value, yeah. Yeah, the value, yeah. I mean, were they, did you go back? I did go back for a year and then. And then left. No, I went on maternity leave. I mean, amazing. Amazing. It's a juggle, it's nice to see you. It's a juggle, it's a juggle. It's a juggle. It's a juggle. It's a j are in, it's nice to see you. It's a juggle. It's a juggle. It's a juggle. I want to try to have everything. Right. We're going to try and squeeze in. Yeah, we are going to squeeze in. So it is from, actually, it's a question from someone that we didn't have time to ask. I think a couple of weeks ago. Here we go. Hi, it's John Robbins here from the Ellis James and John Robbins podcast. Delighted to be finally asked to be on Fighting Talk, even if it's in a sort of a gratis capacity. I found it fascinating that footballing powerhouse, Man City got Noel Gallagher to design their fourth kit, which is a kit that I can only understand the need for if three teams are playing at any one time. It was in a definitely maybe style. It was one of the worst kits ever produced. So my question to the fighting talkies is, what's the best and worst you have looked this year? Well, thank you very much, John. That was left over from last week's show. I should probably have remembered that. So best and and worse you've looked in 2024. I'll start with you, much, John. That was left over from last week's show. I should probably have remembered that. So best and worst you've looked in 2024. I'll start with you, please, Ebony. The best that I've looked was probably at BBC Sports Personality of the Year Awards. Got to glam up. The worst I've looked was chasing off my toddler at Baby Rime Time. That is all you do at Rhyme Time. I just chase the toddler. That is all you do. Never get involved with the rhymes as far as I can tell. Yeah, and wipe off baby thick. Yeah, lovely stuff. And Josh. So best I've looked, probably, I was in Great Nick when I went to on a stagdo in Marbaea in about sort of August time. Worst I've looked is probably the 31st of December a few days ago. Real sort of mess with a man to be honest all downhill from that glorious stag day yeah yeah Jim the worst a look was at the Olympic opening ceremony where all of the reporters were out in the open and it chucked it down and I looked the epitome of the drowned rat and then the best of look was about three days later the sun came out. Bacon hot. Went to report on an event wearing t-shirt, shorts and flip-flops. It wasn't good for anyone else, I have to admit, but it was great to do that. And I guess if we ask this question next year, best will obviously be your Kendrick Lamar outfit. But an equally worst as well. Reese. In Valencia trip in July looking gorgeous tan. Yeah. In the fighting talk outfit? Always. And then worst I've looked is I've just, can you see on my forehead? Yeah, I don't want to mention it, but yeah, yeah. Yeah, you can see it, right? Yeah, of course. You know what I've got. I'm not blind. Do you know there's these things I just realized recently, they're see-through plasters. So this looks way worse than it should, but I've got a massive spot on my forehead but you can't tell me can you can you see I actually cannot see that I could see the plaster have a look at you can't see the plaster with obviously I can't see the place you touch it no no just Just touch it. Just confirm. Oh, I can't see it. This is, I can't. Don't push hard. Have a little. No, with your finger. Go on. Can you feel it? What is it? Ebony, have a go on that. I can't. Can you feel the plaster? Yeah, it could feel that. That is amazing. So that has taken down the swelling by at least 8x. No, it cannot. It cannot have been eight times bigger than that. It's unsightly now. Now I'm looking for me. When you walked in, I was like, who's your friend? Right, that is it for the fast up. All I've say is plenty of room for improvement. Hello sports fans, it's Greg James here coming to you with an exciting announcement. Starting on Monday the 6th of January every every morning on the Radio on Breakfast Show, you could be in with a chance of winning some amazing sporting prizes, including tickets to the men's and women's FA Cup finals, Wimbledon, the Formula One Grand Prix at Silverstone, and more. To find out more details, make sure you're listening to The Breakfast Show with me, Greg James, every morning from 7 o'clock. And go well. Hello and welcome back to Fighting Talk. Welcome back to our panel in descending height order. All heights, I have to say, are just complete guesses from me. Ebony Osoro Brown, 6.1. 6.1. Thank you. Reese Parkinson, 511. Hey, come on. There we go. 6-1. Oh, all right, fine. Jim White, 510. Lovely. And little Josh James, 5'3. I feet on 5'10. I feet of 5.10. Sure you are. Interestingly, is 6 foot. We are on the BBC Sounds Up as well, which means if you just join us on the radio, you can go now and listen back from the start, then you won't miss me hearing, me hearing, me calling a man Marcus Grasshopper. And, to be fair, him then calling me Mick. Onwards. Game changer time, five points to be won and lost. And weirdly, it says here, Rick's story about getting a diary for Christmas. Don't have a story about getting a diary for Christmas. Even if I did, Hartsey out, it would be worth sharing. So ignoring that, what are the dates I need to circle on my calendar, which I also don't have? Basically, what are the events or fixtures I can't miss? And why is it essential that you and me are there? Start with Jim, please. Where are you taking me and why? Well, one place I'm not taking you is the Club World Cup final on the 13th of July. You can do what you like. Load of old crap. July, Rick. No, where we've got to have a date, mate, is 28th of September final day of the Rider Cup. And what's fascinating about the Rider Cup is that wherever it's played, the home side win, if it's in your, and it's in the United States. However, I think the European team are going to be really motivated because the Americans are all being paid something like $500,000. And the Europeans aren't, so the Europeans are going to be full of fury about it. All the Europeans are pretty quite annoyed that Rory Macraway is going around saying, I'd pay to play in this tournament. They're like, well, no, but I mean, we would all accept some money. It's going to be great, though. I think it's going to be a lot of, I think it's going to be a lot of, you know, Kenji Lamar-style vibes about that. I mean, obviously you're going to have to... I know it's the Gageap. He's got some of those points for that. Ebony. Mine's got to be the Netball League, Netball Super League season opener. It's going to be on the Saturday, the 8th of March. Okay. And it's the rebrand of the Netball Super League. So it's Netball Super League 2.0. Yes. It's the bigger stadiums, bolder ambition, better standard of play. It's reading directly from their PR release. I am indeed. And it is going to be fantastic. So where's that opening going to be? It's going to be in Sheffield. Sheffield, okay. I've got a trip to the States to watch the rider cap on netball in Sheffield at the moment. Okay. But there's a season that follows. So you can go along and watch and support the girls. All right, all right. Rees, where are you taking me? I'm taking you. Forget Sheffield. I'm taking you to Norleans. And you get to see Jim perform at half time. We are going to the Super Bowl. And the reason being is to Detroit Lions have a chance to make it to the Super Bowl. Their coach is essentially Stone Cold Steve Austin. It's called Dan Campbell. Yeah, yeah. Very stone cold. Unbelievable thick neck on the guy. Huge neck. Yeah. You can only imagine how great his speech will be. Can you imagine Stone Cold Steve Austin given a speech in a Super Bowl? Dan Campbell, Super Bowl, let's go. So it's a good answer. I'd love to go to a Super Bowl. I didn't like you saying Detroit, like you're American. It's Detroit. Josh. So, Better Beav versus Bivel 2 in Riyadh on Saturday, February 22nd. Not just a fantastic undisputed fight, but arguably the best boxing card ever put together. The Comaumon event is Britain's Daniel Du Bois, making his second IBF title defence against former world champion Joseph Parker. You've also got Zee Lezang versus Ajit Kabayel for the playing WBC interim heavyweight title. We've got our very own Joshua Buatzi and Callum Smith doing battle for Boazzi's WBO interim title. And Hamza Shara's fights for the WBC middleweight championship against Carlos Ademez. And yeah, all those events that are on the undercard, they're all headline events. No, I know. That is a great, great lineup. So what am I looking at here? I've got that out in Saudi in February. I've got the Super Bowl. Super Bowl is... Let's go down to a Detroit City. No. It was good about a Detroit City. Is it early February as well? Yes. I could just about fit those two in. And then I've got Sheffield early March and I've got Ryder Cup. Look, I mean, the boxing is... The boxing is fantastic, but I'm not going to Saudi. Sorry, Josh. I think, I think, I think I'm going Super Bowl. Come on. I am. I mean, it would be, it would be, no. So, five points to you, where are you going to take him from? Anyone you want. Anyone you know. I do. I do. I mean, he's got his head down. He's got his head down. Can I just say, Rick, Detroit might not be in the final. Well, does that mean I don't, I mean, I can still go, can I still go. You can go. Yeah. Well, you're only going for one reason to the half time show well you've just lost a lot of points there I'm afraid Jim all right question number whatever this is a recent survey said that 78% more people are searching for fake replica shirts compared with 2023 with parents being priced out of buying the originals from the club. What else in sport is a cheaper or poorer quality version of the real thing, Rees? So if everyone just goes to Google now and types in the Mickey Mouse Cup, you know what comes up? Football League trophy. Does anybody care about that? You have the FA Cup and then everything else is, yeah, the League trophy. Does anybody care about that? You have the FA Cup and then everything else is... The League Cup. We've got to the Semis of the League... No one cares. Let's be honest. It's the Mickey Mouse Cup. It has a Wikipedia page dedicated to it being the Mickey Mouse Cup. How can you take that thing serious? Look at the sponsors that it's had in the past. Everything's bad. I am very glad that is the one trophy that Yogan Kloat won in his last season. I'm thrilled. Thrilled with that. It's the one they all wanted. Right. Ebony. Not to cause offence. I know Josh are a Tottenham supporter, but I'm going to say the purchase... He's heard it all. The purchase of Dominic Solanke, which was for $55 million, which is arguably the lesser or the cheaper version than Harry Kane. Oh, I think, I mean, I think so. It's a decent player. I think that's a bit harsh. I mean, whoever you brought in was not going to be as good as Kane. Josh. You are 100% right now. Oh, okay. Well, you get another point. Yay. Don't describe you. But still, good player. Selanky. So, if you're listening, keep it up. He is. Yeah. What are you listening to? I'm trying to give the team talk here. Just fighting talk. Yeah. So, I've gone for the proposed fight between Chris Hughbank and Connor Ben. I like both fighters. I think they're entertaining. They're always interesting to watching the interview. But we keep getting told that this is the biggest fight in big British boxing, which I like both fighters. I think they're entertaining. They're always interesting to watch an interview, but we keep getting told that this is the biggest fighting, big British boxing, which I struggle to believe. Personally, I haven't got much of an appetite for it. And I'd much rather, they step out of their dad's shadows and go and win their own world titles. I mean, how good would that be, too? A dad and a son, both world champions. So, yeah, the real... But you'll watch it. You were you and you will watch champions. But you'll watch it. You were you and you will watch it. Yeah, you watch it. It'll be good fun. Also would. Yeah. But yeah, I'd rather them go for world titles instead. Jim? Yeah, it's not cheap. I admit this, but it is so pointless and so second rate. Nobody's interested in it. And it's the Saudi Football League. I was reading this week that apparently Marcus Rashford was offered twice what he's being paid at Manchester United which is right up in the super super super what 600 grand. He's got offered 600 grand and he's not going to go there because he realizes if he wants to get back in the England team he's got to be somewhere where people pay attention. Apparently Namar plays there. I've completely forgotten that. Naimar plays in Sand. No one is remotely interested. The only thing that they're interested in is how much was paid to take old players over there. And once they're over there, we forget all about it. Yeah, you're absolutely right. You're like this. My first ever job on Tele was on Rise on Channel 4, the not much loved breakfast show replacement for the big breakfast. With fighting talk legend, Dougie Anderson, in fact, where we first met. And I was described online as a cut-price home county's version of gobbie northern narcissist, Vernon K. And I've always thought, that's about right. Next question, Arise, Sir Gareth. Sir Southgate has been honoured. But who has been criminally overlooked for a knighthood or damehood? Rees. It's his birthday today. He is older than his coach on the team that he plays up. Not your old Japanese footballer again. Yes, it's Mazu. No, his football boots should be put into a British museum. I'm talking about someone whose birthday is today, Sir James Milner. Legend. 23rd season last year. It is mad. And he'll just keep going. How old is he? 39. 39. Decent, isn't it? Yeah. Ebony? I'm going to turn it on his head because I think it should be a damehood. Yes. And I think I deserve a point, although it's going to be an honorary damehood. Okay. So I think if Gareth gets one, Serena Vigman deserves one. I know she's Dutch and doesn't really qualify, but I think special... Again, we can find something. Some sort of dispensation. Yeah. For what she did for the lionesses. Yeah, she's been absolutely unbelievable. And Jim? Because he's a great man and because he's raised so much money and attention and profile for the charity that he's been supporting motor neurone disease, Kevin Sinfield. You know, there's never been... That feels likely, doesn't it? Well, I'll come back to that, there's never been... That feels likely, doesn't it? Well, I'll come back to that. There's never been a knighthood from any rugby league player. Isn't that extraordinary? There's been dozens of them in rugby union. Never been a rugby league player who's been knighted. You know, the whole of Yorkshire and Lancashire must be thinking, hang on, we've had some great people who've played our game and never been knight. And surely it's in field. The one thing, there is a slight caveat on that in that he was got a CBE and apparently there has to be a gap of time before he can be a night. But he will. Surely he's got of me. I think he's in the bag, isn't it? I went, because we're going to do for a podcast extra, great sporting dames and knights top five. So obviously went on the podcast extra. Great sporting dames and nights top five. So obviously one on the Wikipedia page. And the ones, there are some sports that have very few, some that just have none. And then there are ones that have their own page. So it's cricket and rugby. And I think maybe football as well as I'm surprised about. Josh. So, well, it's about time we knighted Ronnie O'Sullivan I think the greatest ever suit the player to ever live uh you've given one to Andy Murray and Ronnie's got more personality in his little toe than Andy in his whole body you've given one to Gariff Southgate I love him but he actually won nothing and Ronnie has won seven world titles and you even go give one to Lewis Hamilton and Ronnie himself once said about Lewis Hamilton it's fantastic for once said about Lewis Hamilton. It's fantastic for Lewis to win seven world titles. If your car's going around quicker, you can afford to make a few mistakes and still get away with it. I wouldn't have felt as good about my career in Snooker if I've been playing on a table where the pockets I was using were bigger than my opponents. It's brutal. It's just a really good point, I know. And it's proper fighting talk as well. Yeah. Okay. Chess, you may have seen this, was in the news over the festive period because the Grandmaster Magnus Carlson withdrew from the World Rapid and Blitz, great name, after he was threatened with disqualification because he is wearing his jeans. He did later come back, but it made me think, what are the other sort of ridiculous or outdated sportswear regulations? Or, if you refer, when should sports be, would just be allowed to wear whatever the hell they want. Jim? It's shin pads. You're meant to wear shin pads, right, when you play football. And you can be booked if you don't. But they don't wear them anymore they wear these kind of tiny little square postage stamps micropads and they all have their socks are putting his forehead yeah very similar they like they prefer to wear their socks rolled down in Jack Greeley's style doesn't help them score goals obviously but you know they'd prefer it like that and I don't see why they can't be allowed to do that. They're not going to get the sore little shins, though, Jim. Well, what, those shin pads they wear to comply with the rules are really going to protect them, you reckon, Rick? No, no, you're absolutely right. Sorry, I shouldn't have questioned it. Josh. So, yeah, anyone who plays Sunday League, they'll know that you often get sort of jobs worth refs that insist on you wearing sock tape, which is the same colour as your socks, or an under armour that is the same colour as your top. So, yeah, I just think it's unnecessary. I get it like in the pro ranks and that, but when you're playing for like the bricklayers arms on a Sunday, you know, is it really matter if I'm wearing black socks and I'm wearing using white tape? Do you know what I mean? I'm only here to have a runabout and kick lumps out of someone, you know? Yeah, it's no needs. Just calm down on Sunday league rest. I'll just wear whatever tape I want. Yeah. Ebony. I'm going to say the Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders. So ridiculous regulations in the sense that they wear a little blue crop top and some white shorts. They train, they perform all year for the Dallas Cowboys. And at the end of the year, they've got to get it all back. So all that hard work, all that complying, all that sweating, and then hand the whole kit back. Hang on. You don't get to keep your kit. Don't get to keep your kit. That is outrageous. That is outrageous. That's hard work. That's hard work. That's appalling. The Dallas Cowboys got to have a look at that. Ries. 2025, let's go to golf. How is it possible that they still have the rule that you can't wear shorts? And they play half of their courses in Florida. In Florida. And I want to see Victor Hovlin's legs. It's ridiculous. It's a bit nice to see everyone's legs actually. It really would. All right, let's talk New Year's resolutions. Mine was, I think I I just had one, genuinely, to try and see the good in people, and it's going badly so far. But what do you suspect were the resolutions for sports stars as we go into 2025, Ebony? I think with sports stars, we go into 2025, Ebony. I think with sports stars, it's always trying to get that 1% isn't it, every single year. So quite often the resolution is that, I'm going to train on Christmas Day. I want to beat my opponent. No, you're not. Like, you're not beating anyone because everyone else is doing exactly the same thing. So stop making a resolution. Yeah, so that is the, because you hear it from athletes so often, don't you? Yeah, I've trained on Christmas Day. But too many of you are doing it to give you an advantage. Just stop. Yeah, so that is the, because you hear it from athletes so often, don't you? Yeah, I've trained on Christmas Day. But too many of you are doing it to give you an advantage. Just stop. Yeah, just stop. Have a nice Christmas Day. It's fine. It's absolutely fine. Josh. I mean, I don't think they're going to do it, but I like to see boxing judges come out and explain their decisions. There's always controversial decisions in boxing, which doesn't really do any good for the sport, you know. And judging a fight is very subjective. I probably should say that. But if the judge has come out and they explained their full processes, then it might help ease people's concerns and, you know, make it a little bit less controversial. Yeah, but is it just going to be like VAR? Is that not the thing? Is that not what we thought with... Well, actually, in Ussick and and Fury's fight they had an AI boxing judge. Yeah. So that might be the answer as well. But that AI boxing judge gave a score that people were even more appalled by didn't it? I can't remember? It said it was like 118, 112 or whatever and everyone was like, well that's nonsense. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe the AI the robot got paid off. Yeah, they're all getting paid off. Maybe, allegedly, I didn't say that. I didn't say that. Give myself a point to try and just gloss over that. Jim, I think this, Wayne Rooney ought to follow Josh's lead and just decide in this year he's going to play a lot more football manager. Because he's got to learn how to be a manager because standing on the touchline at Plymouth at DC United at Derby hasn't done him any good just learn a bit more football manager Wayne he done well at Derby didn't they he had a brief he did all right initially and then they got done he's the opposite of you base he does well up north and badly down south yeah yeah exactly Reese Harry Kane his New Year's resolution is to start learning He does well up north and badly down south. Exactly. Rhys. Harry Kane, his New Year's resolution is to start learning how to put some shelves on his wards because there may be some trophies coming his way. Would you be happy for him, Josh? No. No, come on. No. No. If you leave us, you're gone. You're gone. I don't care what you win. You know what I mean? It's like, yeah. I'd love to see him win something, but I couldn't care less, you know what I mean? I really could not care less. Either you win it with us or you win it, or you don't win it at all, you know? But bear in mind, the single tier coming out of Josh's eye. Okay, let's have a quick check in with the scores then. Oh, surprising. Jim, you are now trailing behind on 20, mainly because Reese took a load of points off for you. Josh, well, well, well. Level of Reese on 24. Ebony out in front on 25. All to play for. Don't look surprise, Ebony. You've had a good back nine. Okay. What was that sign what was that side i've got a good number 12 and i think i'm going to make it to the final two and i always struggle in the final two you do you do my brain doesn't work quicker now i'm actually i'm going to give you another point actually josh Josh, just to see that that sort of sounds. Honesty. Okay, any other business then? Start with you, Ebony. My own business starts with Stormsy. And I don't know if you saw on the news the other day. One of Jim's favourites, I think. Love him. It was all over the national news about him getting banned from driving. Firstly, because he got six points for the tinted windows on his Lamborghini, and then secondly, because he was using a mobile phone at the wheel of his Rolls-Royce. Yes. But the reprimand he received was a £2,000 fine and nine months being banned from driving. And all I thought was, it's just going to hire a driver. Actually give him a ban of, okay, you've got to ride on a tut-totook for nine months or on a boris bike or something actually be a bit creative guys affect his actual life but no i think he made national news it just actually blew my mind yeah so the stomsy's later again so we're making him go around on a tricycle uh Josh um so there seems to be a bit of a theme where I live at the moment, where if you've got the slightest bit of Spanish or Italian in you, then what you'll do, you'll give you a kid a name to represent that heritage. So I know a geezer who's got half Italian granddad, so we decided to call his kid Vincenzo, which is a beautiful name. I just think it's weird on a kid from Billerickey. You know what I mean? If you don't sort of agree, don't think away half a little, imagine if the shoe's on the other foot and you go to Italy and you meet someone who's got a half English granddad and they're like, bonjourno, this is my son, Keith. It's weird. Jim. Just thinking about what Ebony was saying about my good friend Stormsy, when she was saying that he was done driving a Rolls-Royce using his mobile phone, surely, I've got a SCADA and you can just, you know, you can speak without on the mobile phone. I mean, what's he doing? Surely a Rolls-Royce has hands-free, doesn't it? What's going on there? You're not the only person on this panel who would know whether a role that has hands-free. You're a lawyer. Yeah, everyone's sort of looking around around being like, I don't know. Probably texting. Anyway, I'm like half the population, I've just signed up for a gym thing. And unlike half the population, I'm going to really muscle up because I'm going to get that bloody Reese Parkinson. Bring it on, Kendrick. Reese, I've just realized that protein bars, they're not really protein bars, are they? I mean, you're slow to that, mate. Come on. How can a protein bar, what's the protein bar in a birthday cake protein bar? How can you flavour a protein bar with birthday cake? Salted caramel, white chocolate. What's the protein in there? So how is this... Ebony, how is this allowed? I think there's a case. Advertising... Advertis. This is ridiculous. I should eat a protein bar and get protein. Something's fishy there. I think you've let yourself down there because it's so obvious to everyone. Don't eat them. Don't eat them. All right, let's have a look then. Yeah, as you fear, Josh. Jim, trading behind on 22. Reese on 25. Ebony on 27. Josh absolutely flying at the end there on 30. So Ebony and Josh go into the head-to-head. Defend the indefensible. It's a ridiculous statement, you have to answer it, it doesn't matter how much it hurts. If I say I, I mean you. Josh, you scored the most points and you will go first and you have 20 seconds on the following. Daniel Levy was criminally overlooked in the New Year's honours list. Oh well, Daniel Levy, he's done terrific for Tottenham. He's taken us from a sort of mediocre mid-table team to a mediocre mid-table team, you know. So if anyone deserves it, it's him. He's earned a lot of money not just for Tottenham as a club, but for the community. He's raised loads of money for charity, you know, in that area. It's not your forte, is it? No, it's not like. I think this feels like an open goal to me, Emily. All right, you have 20 seconds on this. I'm glad the Commonwealth Games is being ditched. It's a waste of time and money. I'm glad the Commonwealth Games is being ditched, not even all the countries in the world players. Actually, you want to be Commonwealth champion, but are you really the best or the best? It's only got 12 sports, not even even watch as half of them, don't even know any of the stars in it. So what's the actual attraction of watching the Commonwealth Games? And to think it's going to be in Glasgow for the next one in 2026. I think he might as well just get rid of the whole thing. I mean, it wasn't great either, but Jock was that bad. I think he might as well just get rid of the whole thing. I mean it wasn't great either, but this was that bad that I think we've got to give it to Ebony. Well done Ebony. Thank you. Thin round of applause there. Bitter round of applause. Thanks very much for listening. This has been a World Zone production for BBC Radio 5 Live. Weekend mornings on Five Live. Saturdays from 9am.

That's what this shows all about. Sundays from 10. Colleen Murray, Conversation, connection and community. That's what this show's all about. Weekend mornings. On BBC Radio 5 Live. Hello, you're listening to the podcast Extra of Fighting Talk. Does anyone want to have a go at their Defend the Indefensible that they didn't get to do? Reese, do you want to have a go at yours? All right, I'll get you the music up as well. Oh yeah, this is nice actually So you would have 20 seconds on Having a teenager win the Dance World Championship Makes a mockery of the sport Oh, it's absolutely disgusting I mean Luke Littler Luke Littler, who's he? Who is he? Darts isn't even a sport It's basically It's actually pathetic at this point that he is being awarded prize money for throwing a sharp thing at a wall. That's pathetic and just because he's 17. I was doing that at 17. Yeah, that wouldn't have won you anything. Jim, do you want to have a crack at yours? No. But we'll do it anyway. So 20 seconds on, being part of the Sir Alex Ferguson document. Jim, do you want to have a crack at yours? No. But we'll do it anyway. So 20 seconds on. Being part of the Sir Alex Ferguson documentary was a career low point. As I always hated him, I thought he was a crap manager. He was terrible. Come on. Yeah, he won trophies. But where is he now? That's what I want to know. Where is he now? The club that he's meant to built are right at the bottom. And where is he now? He's watching Rangers against Celtic, for goodness sake. The man doesn't care and we have to accept that. He's finished. In my heart he's a goner. I'm not interested. That might have done it for you know, Jim. But you were so far behind. Yeah, you were so far behind. I don't think even if he had to be, Jim. I don't think even if he not. Well, let's have a look. If he points I'd have got to the final, would I? Well, you would have been level with Ebony, and I definitely would have had Ebony in the final or not you. Rees would have been way behind, I'm afraid. How can you be way behind having won the five points? I know. I know. Question for Reese. How were you so far behind having won the five-pointe? I know. I know. Question for Reese. How were you so far behind, Rick didn't like my protein. Yeah. You did lose, I think, about three points with repeatedly saying Detroit and then singing it. That didn't know. Good Sunday that, right? Yeah, it is good. It is good. But not when you say it. Right, we're going to do Rick's rankings. So today we're looking for the greatest dames or knights from the world of sports. So top five, Jim, who are you putting in there? Well, having just pretended not to like him, it's obviously got to be so. I know that's going to be painful for you, Rick, and you're probably going to cut it off. But in that documentary, right, in that documentary was a realization of what he achieved. I mean, the 2008 Champions League winning team for Manchester United was so good that, I mean, just in every position, it was absolutely brilliant. I honestly, I'm that this is, you know, people say this is a joke. I honestly think that 2008 team would be the current team as they are now. When really up front is quicker now than Joshua Xerxie, I reckon. And for sure, you know, Ronaldo would outrun some of the players they've got there. I mean, Ferguson, God, he could build teams. Absolute master of his craft. Yeah. Ferguson, God, he could build teams. Absolute master of his craft. Yeah. You know, he won the trouble without the support of a Middle Eastern potentate. You know, I mean, it's just, just what a performer. Andy was there for so long as well. So I'm sorry, Rick. No, no, you actually don't have to apologize. I'm sorry, mate. Just put him in there. He's in, he's in. Ebony. Mine's got to be Dame Nolene Turer. She's the Silver Ferns netball head coach. What's her surname? Sorry. Turer. Turer. There it is. And I think she is elite. So in 2018, the Silver Ferns, everyone knows in terms of in New Zealand, rugby and netball are like a religion. So for them to go to the Commonwealth Games and achieve fourth place, not even on the podium, having been ranked number one at two in the world at the time, was absolute sacrilege. But however, under her leadership and guidance, the following year at the World Cup, they beat Australia in the final to claim the world championship status. So the turnaround within a year from, I guess, what they could see in bottom of the table, to the top of the table, absolutely phenomenal feat, especially with all the media pressure and the expectation that was up on her shoulders. Fair play. Josh? I've gone for Sir Henry Cooper. He's the only British boxers to ever be knighted. Lots of people that have been overlooked as well. I mean, like the sort of Joe Calzaggy. I think he probably deserves a knighthood. One of our, probably our great stever boxer, really. But yeah, I think a boxer deserves to be in there and it's slim pickings in terms of, you know, people in a boxing world. Just the one. Just the one. Yeah. All right. Henry Cooper. Rees? I take back everything I said about Luke Littler because this man presented him with the one. Just the one. All right. Henry Cooper. Reese. I take back everything I said about Luke Littler. Because this man presented him with the trophy. So Chris Hoy. Chris Hoy. Yeah. I think, what is it, 11-time world champion? Olympian as well. Extraordinary man. Yeah, considering everything now, I think, like, what a fulfilling life to have lived. It's, yeah, pretty profound, actually. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. So the way that he's kind of approaching the situation that he's in now is genuinely inspiring. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, an amazing man. I was straight onto Wikipedia for this. is genuinely inspiring. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, an amazing man. I was straight onto Wikipedia for this. I made no apologies for it. Just because I thought, well, I obviously don't know who all of the sirs and dames are. And I was immediately captivated by someone called David Faghan, Sir David Fagin, who is a guy from New Zealand, so another New Zealander, the only person to have been knighted for services to shearing. He's a sheep shearer. He's won the golden shears in New Zealand a record 16 times and has set 10 world records. Is it a sport? It's more of a sport than dance. So, here they are in no particular order. Top five Dameswell Knights from the world of sports. Sir Alex Ferguson, Dame Nalene Terrer, Sir Henry Cooper, Sir Chris Hoy, and a guy you've never heard of who's a sheep shearer called Sir David Fagan. That's your hot for this week. Thanks very much, everyone. Brazilian Minaldo."}
