Hunting eggs like Easter Bunny. I'm Rick Edwards, and this a fighting talk. Looking down at my papers in front of me, I realize I've completely forgotten to write an intro. So just take a few moments to imagine your own, some sort of sporting analogy, sort of whatever you like. Just put it in here. Yep, everyone done? Good. On four, show number 13, overtaking on the all-time list of appearances, Rick Edwards. Is it just coincidence that he's finished last or joint last each of the three times he's been on with me hosting? Yes, it is coincidence, those finishes are entirely related to his performance levels. You can't just keep saying Matt Letticee and expect to get points. Comedian Tess Ilias. Hello, Tess. 13 times. So 13 is my lucky number so hopefully this will be the one. Where I finished third. You know I like it. Yeah, thank you. And I'm going to give you just a couple of points head start. Thank you very. And I still think you won't make the final. Oh, well, I'm aiming for third. Dizzy, dizzy heights. An 11th appearance, one away from what is known as, of course, the Rick Edwards threshold. And we'll also be hoping to get over the Rick Edwards win threshold of four fighting talk victories. In his 10 shows to date, he's never finished worse than joint second. As such, a very strong chance to reach his first champion of champion show, subject to being available in mid-May. Big issue billionaire Paul McNamee! Hello, Paul. Hello there. How are you doing? I'm very well, thank you. Now, I did an interview for a recent big issue. Thank you. Thank you for having me. Same issue as an Eric Cantanar feature, but you chose to put Eric on the cover, not me. So I apologise. Would that get me a point back? Yeah, straight back again. It's that easy. Nice to have you here, Paul. Back before her fifth appearance of the season, a former fighting tour champion of champions, but we're just the one win to her name this campaign, needs a miracle to get to the final four in May to fight for the biggest prize in Saturday morning lighthearted sporting punditry. Manchester City Apologist and Tartan Army member, Scott Fort Branch, Natalie Pye! Hello, now. Hi, Eric. How much on a scale of one to an absolute shedload Do you hate the international break? Yes, massively, especially when John Stones, Manwollicanji, Kyle Walker or now doubtful, yes, hate it. Especially when Scotland are losing as well. Hate it. Awful, awful, awful. We can agree on that. You get point out. Finally, the fourth person with the surname James to appear on Fighting Talk, joining Merlin Act of Bradley and comedians Ellis and Josh. 18 footballers have been Fighting Talk champion only once has the show been won by a goalkeeper. Mark Schwarzer in February 2017. A very impressive 53 England caps. Former Watford, Liverpool, Villa, West Ham, Man City, Portsmouth, Bristol City and Bournemouth, number one. David. David. Rick? Is that it? No, no, no. We were discussing on 5'5 breakfast this week, and I was speculating that we, I think we're friends now. What do you reckon? We're getting there, aren't we? We're on the right path. In my world, you are one of my besties. That's fantastic news. Yeah, I'm giving out. Very general. Willie nilly. Let's get down to the, I'm giving out point. Very general. Willey-nilly. Let's get down to the business of punditry if we can. Have I got the bell? I've got the bell. Fantastic. Fighting talk is never one willing to resort to cliche or to clutch at the obvious. So, happy Easter everyone. Who from sport is a good egg and more interestingly, who is a very bad one? T Tess get me started Matt let's know good egg Lamine Yamal Barster's 16 year old star boy made his law league deady last year at 15 been set in the world on fire had two very good performances for Spain this week and in a recent interview was asked what subject she liked at school. He said, I'm not great at maths, but I enjoy it. It keeps me entertained. What a good egg. Bad egg? Bad egg. And everyone seemingly involved in Formula One who is not a driver. Just scandal after scandal after scandal. Just a bunch of bad eggs. Box of eggs. A collection of bad eggs. What's a collective noun for eggs? David James says batch. Any advance on batch? Eggs. Eggs? Are you thinking just the S? I'm looking for a collect. It can't be an eggs of eggs. Half dozen. No, no. Give it to David with bat. A lay of eggs? I mean, God knows. It doesn't really matter. Paul. Good egg. Jack Grelish. Yeah. Jack Grealish. Yeah. Jack Grealish is one of those people who you suspect, even if he had no money, he would be just a decent chap. Anytime there's any footage of him, there's viral footage going around at the moment from medal awards after the Super Cup. When, again, after the Seville match, they were being presented with their medals everybody walked past this one kid apart from Jack Greilish. Sephirin the head of you if it was trying to stop him Jack said no and he just stopped with this girl and he spoke to her turned out the girl was blind he's particularly good with kids with disability his sister his cerebral palsy any time you see Jack Greilis you just think think, he's a good one. I shouldn't have asked about good eggs, actually. I just want to hear bad eggs. Who's your bad egg? Connor McGregor. Yeah. I have nothing good to say about Connor McGregor. I hate MMA anyway. I think it's not really a sport. It's just ridiculous. You know? Ned Bolting said exactly the same thing last week. Did he? Yeah? Yeah. So you're in good company, though. Oh, not sure I agree with that. Oh. Oh, go on. Oh, not sure I agree with that. Oh, go on, go on. Listen, listen. Don't be shy about getting involved, David. So would you, would you say karate is a sport? No, smash, would you car. Here we go. He's luring you into a verbal trap here for. But the point is MMA is all of these mixed into one. And when you see proper MMA fighters fighting, it is, it is poetry. Would you say egg is a food? Would you say that... One of the great questions. Would you say that... It's a yes for me. Honey is a food. Would you say that cabbage is a food? That doesn't mean you have to put all those foods together and say that means... Oh, yeah. It's an excellent. I think... Do you know what? I thought you had him on the robes and he's absolutely nailed you there, David. Basically said that they're all foods. He hasn't said that none of them aren't foods or combined they're not food. And if you're a master chef with that ingredient, you take the point that egg, I would eat that. I would eat that. Yes, I do know you'd eat that. Port some water into it. It's a disgrace. Matt. I don't know what's going on. Good egg quickly, please. Good egg. Jude Bellingham and Phil Foden, both good eggs. Did you see them? They gave the little England mascots their jackets. I loved it. Just a little thing that'll mean so much to those kids, those freezing old, those freezing poor kids. Yes. And then the bad eggs, the people that keep putting the kids out as mascots in shorts and t-shirts all the time. Like these, we don't have, we're not Spain, we don't have the weather for this. Give them some thermals. Right, at least a jacket. The players have got jackets, but we're sending the kids out in short-sleeved shirts. Unacceptable. I've never thought about it. You're absolutely right about that. I was a working class kid from Blackburn at the age of 12. And if I was offered the chance to go out to Wembley in shorts and t-shirts in March, I'd be like, oh my God, yes, please. I agree. Yeah, but you'd be chilly, though, wouldn't you? For what? And it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to walk out with Jude Bellingham. It's not one or the other. I'd ferns it for 10 minutes. No, it's true, actually. You could have trouble. I'd ferns it for 10 minutes, though. David, good egg, please. You spent 120 quid on a shirt. You'd want to show over on it. Yeah. A good egg. Mine is more global. I just think a good sports person. The person who is accepting that their defeat was due to the opposition being better and being able to shake hands or the person who loses is not going to be grudged at the person who is better than them beating them. I've got to say, you'll do better if you give specific answers. That is specific. I was waiting for the name. Are we getting the name? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Exactly. Give us a name. Garrette, after Brazil won one. Okay. I mean, I don't for the name. Are we getting the name? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Exactly. Give us a name. Garry Southgate after Brazil won. Okay, I mean, I don't have the facility to give you half a point, but that's what I was thinking about. Bad Egg? My old teammate, but he wasn't my mate. So he wasn't a teammate. He was a team not mate. Okay. Name and shame, please. That's a name. He had his own nickname. Come on. Blakey. Come on. I forgot his name now. He's just team not mate. He used to cheat at cards. And in a team, you cannot have a cards cheat. Give us a club. Is it a poker club? Seven of clubs. No. Oh, I thought you meant a card. Club you play for. I'm not a magician. Portsmouth. Portsmouth. Blocke. Nitham Blake. He called himself Blake. He had his own nickname. No one has their own nickname. Oh, he gave it. That is. But I mean, I don't know whether. I suppose I'm giving you. I'm giving you a point for, we try to do really weird. Well, I like that. I'm trying to be friends with David. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. But also, you've got to give me some names over the course of this next hour. Please, David. Thank you. All right. Question number two comes from you, the listeners. Could be, could be a made-up name actually. This. Chris Guinness is on the line. Hello, Chris. Hello. Is it a real name? Yeah, that's my name. Yeah, good, yeah, just checking. Your theme music. Why are we playing that, Chris? Chris. Oh, why are you playing it? The Guinness ad. Yes, exactly right. And what's your question? So, hello, Chris. Hello, Chris. Hi, Chris. With Paul's Bad Egg, Connor McGregor, giving a pretty awful performance in the new Roadhouse movie, what do you think was the worst ever film or TV appearance by a professional sportsperson? It's a lovely question, Chris. If you haven't seen Roadhouse, and I'm thrilled to say that I have, Conner McGregor's performance is absolutely horrendous, but in my view, in a good way, like early Arnold Schwarzenegger vibes where you're like, what the hell is this and why do I like it so much? It is mad, absolutely mad what it does in that film. Paul, bad sporting cameos. Dennis Rodman, series four celebrity big brother. That is one of the worst. Dennis Rodman went in as a global superstar. Everyone thought, here he comes. We're going to get something special here. He was a horrendous character, charmless, unpleasant, bullying. He was so bad that the winner of that show was not Dennis Rubman, but was Chantelle Houghton, who wasn't even a celebrity. And he was also so bad, the runner up was Michael Barrymore. Looking for redemption. Michael Barrymore came runner up ahead of Dennis Rodman. That was the worst performance. Also, the thing with Robman is you have a kind of romantic idea of what Rodman is going to be. And then the reality was, it was very disappointing. Not a cameo or acting appearance, so I'll take a point off. Tess. Oh, took you back to the summer of 2011. We're here out from the Olympics. Country still together. It's a nice place to be. Blackburn Rovers, in their Infinite Wisdom, release an advert, advertising the owner's chicken brand, Venkees. Oh, yes. Remember it. And it featured the first team, players including Ryan Nelson, Chris Samba, David Dunn, Morton Gams Pedersen. Just a horrendous advert with some of the worst acting I've ever seen in my life. And that season, we got relegated with a music with a music. 31 points, or I'd like to call it, chicken feed. Yeah, yeah, good answer. David. Well, there was a show called Crossroads. Myself and Dion Dublin were on it on an episode. Everyone immediately getting on YouTube. Yeah, that is not my... Is that a good score? No, that's just the music. But my vote goes to Dan Marino. In Ace Ventura? He was so wooden. He was really good, isn't. No, just like Conradger. The listers were out. And you enjoy it? No, Conan McGregor. Yeah, no, true, true. I've seen it and I'm laughing at you as you're describing what I thought I saw and no one else did. You know what I mean, don't you? It was like, why? Seriously? Yeah. But Dan Marino was, the best bit was when he bent over and you could tell that he was a man. I don't you think that was him. Nah. So I love a good comedy, like really stupid comedy, random film. So obviously I'm a big fan of the classic comedy film, Dodgeball, a true underdog story. It's from 2004, and that is an important note before I give you the name of the person. Vince Vaughn plays the owner of a gym. At average Joe's gym. It's full of like, you know, eccentric people in the gym. They enter a dodgeball competition. They can win £50,000. They need to win it to save the gym. Towards the end of the film, Vince Vaughn decides he's going to quit. So he goes to the airport and he sat at the airport when this sports star comes up to him and gives him the chat that revitalises him. And that sport star is 2004's Lance Armstrong, who says this to him, quit. You know, once I was thinking about quitting when I was diagnosed with brain lung and testicular cancer all at the same time. But with the love and support of my friends and family, I got back on the bike and won the tour to France five times. Not aged well. Not aged well. Listen, if you inject the love of your friends and family, sometimes, it will inject the love of your friends and family, sometimes. It will do the job. Chris, some good answers there. Who are you giving yours to? Four good answers, but I remember the awful Blackwell and Rover's advert, so it's got to go with Tess. What is the TV? What's even a TV program? Tess is like punching the air. Tess is rightly and excited. Tess is rightly excited. He's never done this far. I feel like Conan McGregan, Roadhouse. Howie? Thank you very much, Chris. Having a good day. Cheers, mate. Thank you, bye. Thank you, Chris. Love you. The next, absolutely pathetic. The next topic is sort of about this. Now through the middle with Venetius. Finisius with a chance. It bounces to Hendrick. And Hendrick, the 17-year-old, scores his first goal for Brazil here at Wembley Stadium against England. So England lost to Brazil last weekend, but it was the multicolour cross on the collar that got some England fans shirty and hot under the collar and cross. They were hot cross fans. That's enough. What are the other times when the kit has overshadowed the sport? There's some obvious ones here. Paul. I've decided to avoid the obvious ones. Thank you. And I'm going for a complete sport. And that is golf. Golfware. Every time I see those people playing golf, I've never played golf. I think this cannot be a sport if you're wearing stretch slacks. That is not a way to go out and play sport. They wear stretch slacks and then they have strange ill-fitting tops that are not necessarily, and this is for the men playing golf, for men who are in the shape that they are in. I think that golf wear is not good wear. Unless, and this is the, I'm going to be very strict on this golfers, unless you go back to wearing tweed plus fours and tweed fit at jackets from a good tailor, you should not be playing golf and you should not be wearing golf gear. That's proper fighting talk. Natalie. Talking about hot under the collar, Rick. Back in the early 2000s, I was a club 1830s rep in Ibiza. Now, during this time, I witnessed a lot of stuff. You can imagine. And I may or may not have witnessed quite a few wet t-shirt competitions in that time. But that's to be expected, I think, in the early 2000s in Ibiza. I think what's not to be expected was Aston Villa having a wet t-shirt competition every game at the start of this season. The season just gone. Because basically, if you remember, they got the new shirt, which apparently they said lacked breathability and held onto the sweat, basically just making all the shirts look like a wet t-shirt competition and fully clinging to the bodies. Yeah, and they started wearing the replica kits, didn't they? They had to change the kits, yes. Right, David. Yeah, I'm thinking more of a, rather than a kit, 1996, the tradition was in a cup final. The cup final teams would get their suits. Oh, yes. And we, at Liverpool, after a conversation. And we at Liverpool, after a conversation between myself, George O'Marni's press team and the club captain John Barnes opted for a cream suit. You were responsible? No, I passed on the information. Yeah, you were. Anyone who saw John Barnes' suits in the 90s would have known that John Barnes actually sewn this one down. And the Cup final has been remembered more for the suit, I think, than the actual scoreline. Yeah, it was 1-0 to Man United. Yeah, it was 1-0 to Man United. I wasn't asking you for the score. Oh, okay, I thought you forgot. Some of us remember. I had to watch it through the windows of a Dixon's. I mean, honestly, one of the lowest moments of my life is watching you unsighted as Cavanof voided in. Were you unsighted? What's going on? No, I was being MMA pinned down. You weren't getting picked. Get up, save it! It's etched into my brain that. I can see, also I can see every angle of the replay of that goal. I hate it so much. So much. I'm taking a point of you for conceding it. I'm lucky. That is unlucky. I can see that is unlucky. Just upset my grass, time. I've gone gold, silver bronze. Bronze. Bronze, Cameroon's 2002 home kit, iconic sleeveless vest. Oh yeah. That they won the 2002 Afcon in. The African Cup of Nations was won in that kit. And then they got to the World Cup that summer and FIFA said, you're not allowed, what you're doing? You can't do that. So they had to saw some black sleeves onto it so they could bear it due to the World Cup. That's a little bit you forgot your feet. The kit manufacturer was Puma. They could have just done that forum. I don't know who did that. Too embarrassed to make the course of humour. And then silver medal to Manchester United, the iconic grey kit. When they went three and all down, Southampton at half time, and Fungi made them change the kit. Too obvious. Okay, and then gold is Cameroon two years later. Puma did not learn their lesson. So after the vest fiasco, they then created a onesie kit from Cameroon. Which also breached FIFA regulations. And you're like, you think, Puma, what? You do? And you think, actually, that's good marketing, that. Because everyone's talking about Puma. Yeah. Yeah. Also, of course, like Puma are trying to get out of that deal. Yeah. How can we upset the Cameroonian team? Let's have a look at the scores. Then, David, trailing on debut, as is to be expected, Cameroonian team. Yeah. Let's have a look at the scores. Then, David, trailing on debut, as is to be expected, on 10. Paul has 13. Natalie on 15. This is unprecedented. No. You are currently leading on 16. I wouldn't be surprised, honestly. Uh-oh. I would be surprised if you just walked out now. It's not going to get better than this. I'm tempted. This is a quick one now. Heartbreak this week for Wales. Here he comes. Dan James. Oh, Shesney saved it. Shesney throws himself to his right hand side. It is desolation and disappointment for Wales. Poor old Dan James, who joins Paul Bowden as a mister of spot kicks that may well have taken Wales to a major finals. But what is the most iconic and painful penalty miss of all time? A quick one, please. Natalie. Scotland, 1996 euros, still as devastated as you are about Liverpool, Rick. Gary McAllister misses the penalty because Yuri Geller moves the ball. What the heck? And then Scotland go out on goal difference. Thank you, Yuri. Paul. Roberto Baggio, 1994, World Cup final with a vine ponytail. Could have won it. Over the bar. Brazil took it. I mean, amazingly, for the player that he was, it's sort of the thing that you first think of as well. He says it's still handsome. Yeah. I can imagine it. It does. Tess. I'm going for my Waddle, which is Garrow Southgate 96, was my first international tournament. And it just felt like all the ducks were landing up in a row and it felt like it was coming home, all that stuff, and then he didn't, because Garret Southgate couldn't take a penalty. Yeah, me and my dad had tickets to the final and it was fairly just supposed to go to a final without England. And then you have to wear back on his head in a piece out. Yeah, so it all works out well in the end. David. I'm going to be counting on manager. Interested to hear interested in your answer here okay i'm going for a game uh f a kuhk come on quick answer yes 2010 yes f a cup final mhm kim prince rogang penalty saved by pedichick then frank lampard misses to the right as I dive to the right, because he knew I was going the right way, and he misses his penalty. WNWD 1-0, but it's the only FA Cup final with two missed penalties. Did you save yours? I was on the way to saving it. That is a very clear no. All right, last one before we go to a break. Sven Goren Erickson took charge of Liverpool in a legends game against Iax last weekend. The former England boss said, and I quote, it's always been my dream to manage Liverpool, even if just for one game. So what is your lifelong dream in sport, and are you ever going to achieve it net? So just take a moment, Rick, just to say that I've achieved many lifelong dreams in these last few years of being a Manchester City fan, seeing them win the Champions League in person, seen them in a United in a cup final, seeing them win a treble, a domestic treble. Still denies. You know, many more. In terms of watching, I want to see Scotland in a World Cup in person. Like, I want to be there. And I was getting like dead hopeful. And now we've gone seven games in a row without a win and we're going into the Euros. And I feel like we're never going to qualify for another World Cup again. And I desperately want to see it. So that's what I want to see in terms of what I want to take, like do in sport, Rick, I want to win the mum's race at Reggie's school. Yes, here we go. Oh yeah. And given the fact that I think I'm the only person that takes it serious, I think I've got quite a good chance because I'm in training now. Are you going to wear spikes? Oh, I'm going to. Yeah, oh, okay, Rick, I appreciate that. Bring your own blocks. Yes. It's intimidated if nothing else. Yes. Paul. Mine is a dream that I will never realize, but it is one that I used to have 1985 Barry McGuigan against Giusebio Podroza at Loftus Road. I loved Barry McGuigan. I still love Barry McGuigan. I posted Barry McGuigan. He was my pin-up before any footballer. That night, I was serving Mass. I was an altar boy. I said to Father McWilliams before Mass. You got to let us out early so we go and see McGuigan. He flew through Mass. Got in the bike, got up and watched that fight. And I relived that so many times. Still get emotional thinking about it. Thinking about his dad singing Danny Boy. Thinking about dropping Pedro's in the seventh round. Thinking about 15 rounds. But I'll never do it. I mean, look, I've got to say, I start feeling a bit emotional that. Taz. Lifelong dream. You know soccer head? Yes. I get picked for that. It's the 40th minute. We're two-nulled down. We just got a three-kick, 25 yards out. But Mark Wright right lips off injured Harry red nap turns to me it's time son I got on first kick whipped the ball left-o-tie top bins 2-1 first off injure time ball comes to me in the left I look up meet shira's eye he knows coming we've done this in training all week he makes it run I bit the bowling Shira steams in heads in past Diji Bufon 2-2. I haven't finished. Second half is scrappy. Second half is Scrappy. We go three two down. Timothy Chamonleet trips over himself. And bundles it in. 75th minute, Rednap wants to bring me off. Vernon Kate wants to have a go. I say, no, Harry, I'm not leaving. He says fine and takes Scorlese off instead. 85th minute, we get a penalty. I want to take it, but Paddy McGin is it having it. He takes it, misses. We're still three two down. Ninety third minute, we get another penalty. Sheer snatch take it, but Paddy McGuinness in having it. He takes it, misses. We're still three to down. 93rd minute, we get another penalty. Shear snatches the ball off Paddy and gives it to me. I step up, Pennecure down the middle, 3-3. The game goes to Penns. I score mine. Maria Maggoyler's save Sarah Michelle Gale's weak effort, England win 5'4 and man in the match. Well, I enjoyed that enormously. You don't often get a round of applause at this show, but that did just happen. spontaneous. Timothy shall happen. Rightontaneous. Timmy! Right, David, I'm going to assume that your answer starts with, but this isn't a dream as such. Carry on. No, that was a dream because having been selected for Socrates this year, it might happen. Every other one we've lost. Thank you. Well, get me in? I will have a word. Thank you. So you wonder why I was in this attire today? Yeah, so I need to describe you're in a full Great Britain Adidas track suit. Retro. And it's retro. And you've checked the label. You look good. I checked the label. It's authentic. Yes. So my dream, when I was a kid at school, I was a bit of a sport, Billy. The only discipline that I didn't do was the pole vault. My teacher says to me, I'm going to practice pole vote because we're going to put you in a decathlon. Yeah. You look like a decathlon. Thank you. You do. And I practiced the pole vault, and they cancelled the decathlon. It's really hard the pole vault. It was the only time I ever practiced the pole vault. So my thing, and I wanted to be, Daly Thompson, hence this outfit. Yes, yes, yes, yes. I wanted to win the World Gold Olympic decathlon. I wanted to whistle to the national anthem, as Daly did and got crucified for it, and do a somersault and do all those things with a big tash. Yeah, I mean it's a really, really good answer. All right, everyone dust yourselves down. Be ready to go again in a few minutes right after the news and the proper sport. Welcome back to Fighting Talk. Welcome back to our panel, Terzilias, Paul McNamee, Natalie Pike and David James. Now a little bit of insight for you as we took that brief break, immediately a very competitive David James started querying the scoring. How did that accusing Tess of giving too long an answer, milking it for points. And it reminded me that footballers are always like this. So when John Faschnie was on, he actually kept his own score. So it just was noting it down. So you might want to take a leaf out of his book and just see what you think you deserve, David. Panel. All right, game changer time. Five points to one of you. None for the rest. Happy birthday, BBC Radio 5 Live. Listeners and presenters have selected their number one sporting moment of the 30 years on this network. First of all, panel, for a bonus point, can you guess what won? Tess, quickly? No will suffice, David. What was the question? Linus is winning the Euros. Yes, very, very breathless. Super Saturday? Great guess. Paul? The rugby, Wilkinson scoring. 2003. Blackwood and Rovers were in the Premier League, May 95. Absolutely not. Well, it was actually this. Barra Hista Front. Barra wins. All Britain. In the main 10,000 meters. And immediately. Bonus points. Natalie Pike. Super Saturday. So that was number one but this is of course fighting talk so I want to know what was the worst moment of the last three decades of sports. What is, what are you gesturing like that for David? I'm sorry that he was a whole day. David, give me the worst moment of the last three decades of sport, please. Well, you just mentioned Clinton Morrison and talking about England, and I don't want to say anything bad about England, but 2008, England versus Croatia, at Wembley, 3-2. Oh, that was... Oh, it was terrible. And the worst thing was, I'd been called back into a squad, which I'm really happy about, although I didn't get to play. And Nicco Crunchier, my teammate at Portsmouth, who I knew Inside Out. Player, actually. to play. And Nico Cranchier, my teammate at Portsmouth, who I knew Inside Owl. Player, actually. Proper player. Best shooter in a club. He was lining the shop, I'm going, I know what you're going to do now. I actually know what you're going to do now. I know how you're going to do this every day in training. And he did it and scored, and we went out. And the lesson there is, play DJ. If you've got DJ there, play him. Oh, just don't have him on a bench knowing what's going to happen on the pitch. Natalie. So Super Saturday is the number one because everybody loves the Olympics. We love the Olympics because it shows us who's the best. Who is the best? You know, Mo Farrow is the best. Kelly was the best. These are the people were the best. We don't share medals at the Olympics. So not since 1912 did anybody decide to share a medal at the Olympics. Now, I know for a lot of people, this moment is probably in one of their best sporting presenters. It's because the soft. I agree. Yes, Tess. Not me because, apparently, if you go back to Tokyo 2020 that was held in 2021, people say it was the greatest high jump competition of all time. The high jumpers were doing their personal best. They were doing their seasons best, three of them jumped two meters 37. And then, without jumping again, two of them just decided that they were going to share the gold. Tambari and Barishim, I think, were the pronunciations, they just shared the gold. We don't know who the best is now because there's two of them just going, oh, let's not jump again, let's just share it. It's an absolutely glorious moment. Don't know what you're talking about. Horrendous. Paul? This was when United were supposed to be on the up again under Oligona Solciar, who foolishly was given the job. Two points, two points. It was the Europa League Cup final, May 2021 against Fioriel. United should have won that. United actually, for once, had a decent team with Cavani and Pogba and Fernandez. They really should have won the game. Got to extra time, couldn't do it, got to penalties. They lost in penalties. I can see what you're doing, Tess. I can see that smallest violin sign. They got to penalties, Tess, and we lost 1110 in penalties. That was one of the worst moments I have ever had. Glorious. It was terrible. There's four other people sitting around this desk. Absolutely loving the memory though. Definitely worth three points. I mean, was that as bad as Blackburn Rovers or via Sportak, my score when David Boughty and Graham the soul decided to have a fight? No. Anyway, my worst moment of the last 30 years is Derby County in 2007-8, where they amassed a measly 11 points, winning one, drawing eight, and losing 29 games in the entire season. They scored only 20 goals in 38 games, conceding 89. Top scorer in the league was won Kenny Miller with four. And my favourite thing about... Scotland's finest. My favourite thing about the whole thing is Robbie Savage played the last 16 games for them that season. Fact. And they got knocked out in the first round of the League Cup and the FA Cup. Right. I've got to give someone five points here. So I've got Croatia beating England three two. I've got the glorious shared high jumps. Definitely not that. I've got United losing a final, I mean, which I love as well. And I've got a derby season. I don't really remember. None of you are getting it. Let's move on. Play the thing. Thank you. Listen, if none of you give a decent answer, I can't give five points out. Now, whilst the makeshift raft from the Titanic film and the Axe and the Shining fetched the Big Bucks, a red thong, which is worn in the full full Monty sadly went unsold, unloved, and we hope untouched at this week's big Hollywood props auction. So what is the one bit of sporting memorabilia you would not want to own, irrespective of the value, Paul? I've got two of them. It is the club championship trophy and the senior club championship trophy from West Palm Beach Golf Club. These are relatively new trophies. They were awarded last week to a young thrusting pup called Donald Trump. Donald Trump just happens to own West Palm Beach Golf Club and somehow rose to the top and won these trophies. Not worth a single brass farthing. Don't want them, you can keep them. You are fake news. Thank you very much. Tess. Is something from last week sporting memorabilia? I don't know. Hold on. Are you awarding points now? I'm just doing fighting talk, Paul. You are so full of yourself. You can't even look at Paul. Look at him. Look at him. I'm just doing fatting talk, Paul. You are so... You can't even look at Paul. Look at Paul when you say that. Look at him. I'm just doing fighting talk, Paul. Look at him. He's back to him. Look at him. It's turned his back. Look at him. It's not worth it. Come on, man. Look at him or you lose points. It's not memorabilia, Paul. Thank you very much. Carry on. The match ball. The match ball from this weekend. The match ball from last season's game at Ewood Park in which Burnley beat Blackburn Rovers and clinched the championship title at Ewood Park. We're arch rivals winning the league at our ground, beating us, sending us into mid-table mediocrity as they went to the Premier League, humiliating. Well, look, I enjoyed the pain in your eyes there. David. He used his pain for like 30 seconds till you pressed the button. The arguing today's amazing. Don't be impatient. It's called improv. Hang on, I have some guy in a van on the motorway today. He's really wound me up. Anyway, go back to 2008, England versus Croatia. Not this again. The worst sporting moment in history. Which in the sake. Hang on. Carry on, carry on. I'll, I'll keep on. I'll be your newly friend. Come on, come on. My friends don't normally do that to me. The umbrella from that game. The umbrella. Is that the umbrella? That umbrella. That bit of sporting memorabilia from 2008 is the thing that you would never want to have. Wally with the Brolly? Thank you very much. Oh, that's actually very good. That's very good. Someone's got on that, haven't they? Someone has that. You wouldn't want that? I'd want that. But if you went around the person who had that, you don't even know. Tess just muttered, that's a good answer, and Tess doesn't matter that often. I've heard Tess mutter loads when he gets to the parker class, but anyway. Natalie. Who would have thought I was the least argumentative on a fighting show by the way, Rick? This is insane. Wow! First I would like to take this opportunity to just speak to my dad to direct. So my dad collects programs. Hello Mr Pike. Hello Mr Pike. My dad is a huge program collector, Rick. He is obsessed. He has thousands and thousands. He goes to program fairs weekly. They go back to pre-war programs. Man is obsessed. When my dad dies, I don't want his programs. Oh. Don't need to be the programs, Dad. Dad, don't want to be the programs. What's going to happen to the program? Someone sort them out. He's going to have to sort them before then because I ain't going through them. I'm not selling them. I'm not sorting them, Dad. No. I'm not the bit though. Sell them. Yeah, yeah. All right. Question number, whatever it is. With renowned artist, David James on the panel, gives us the chance to ask what we think is the first time ever. Sports greatest artwork. And I will start with you, David. Well, sport, it's interesting because as a footballer who likes art, I did once look into why there wasn't much football art. I know the PFA just down the road here had a Lowry, which I think they sold for a few million quid, which was nice. Well done the PFA. But the issue with football, I thought, is a disposable kind of entertainment. And when you see the winning goal of Blackburn in, I don't know they lost 2-1 at Amfield when they won the title. Yeah, I was playing. The winning goal by Jamie Rednapp. That moment is kind of captured by a million people and then forgotten about it the next day. So I did a painting once in 2016 of the England... Sorry, your answer to sports greatest artwork is one of your own pieces, is it? I just wanted to say that I thought that the England team had the 50th anniversary of winning the World Cup needed to be immortalised in art. So I did the painting. You've seen a clip of that. The problem I found with art, Man City... Is that just a bit of background info? That wasn't the answer. It's an FYI answer, yeah. The answer is... Did you complain about me? Doing long answers. Bert Troutman, yes. Who broke his neck. At the Etty had stadium. Yeah. There is a statue of him diving down on the stairway near the front office, which is magnificent, because that guy is a legend was a legend it took you about five minutes to get there but you have got a point Natalie first of all Ronaldo statue can we just can we just have a moment of course we can have a moment of course to say the world's most vain man has a statue that looks like it's melted he looks like he's just open the arc at the end of the Rays of Lost Art. It's absolutely amazing. But in honour of Manchester we are in Manchester and given the fact that this actual painting is across the road from where we are currently sat and this man is a proud mank. I have to say it's a bit of a serious answer Rick but I feel like sometimes you like it you appreciate the serious after now and again. Lowry's going to the match, sold for £7.8 million a few years ago and is now in the museum just behind where we are. Surely that's the best. Yeah, any of your own art that you want to plug quickly? No, I do have a picture of Sean Goet scoring against Fabian Bartes in my downstairs toilet. That doesn't count. Okay. Paul. I think any piece of art has to have an emotional connection to you. There has to be some resonance there. You have to connect straight away. And for me, the most potent piece of art in sport, in all of sport, is the Munich clock on the south stand at Old Trafford. There is something incredibly powerful about it south stand at Old Trafford. There is something incredibly powerful about it. It's just frozen in time, February 6, 1958. Every time you go there, no matter what kind of mood you're in when you go to Old Trafford and you see the clock, you just stop, pause and think. And I think that is the single best piece of art in sport. Yeah, it's a serious answer, and it's a really good answer. Tess, good luck following that. It was a good answer as well. I'm going to go for Myron's sculpture from the 5th century BC. Of course you are. Of Disgobulus, that one? Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, so that is one of the oldest... You know, the discors sort of behind the... Yeah, bent over disco. From the year 450 BC, that, been replicated many, many times, and it's probably inspired a lot of modern sporting art, iconic, and the oldest sporting art that exists in the world. And how are you for Google? Donald Bell. For Googling. No, no, but it's a good one, though. That's three really good answers and then whatever they said. Wow, again, see, it takes so long answering and you just keep pressing your button. Just tell him, he's not your friend for one. Discopolis. It's not coming to your party. Scobulus, yeah. You like that statue, though, don't you? It's a good one. It hasn't helped discus throwing. They're still doing discos. They are, true, yeah. Manchester City against Arsenal is on Sunday. It will be live on 5 Live. Massive game, obviously, in the Premier League title race. I want to know who's going to be grabbing the headlines, and what will that headline be, Tess? I think it will be Saka, having pulled out of the England squad. He will make a miraculous recovery, score the winning goal, and the headline will be Saka has risen because it's Easter weekend. Yeah, it was. Solid answer that. Paul. I also think Arsenal are going to win, I think, as has been discussed, there are some injury problems at the back for Mancetti. I think Pep Guardiola is going to throw a hissy fit as Pep Guardiola likes to when he doesn't get his own way. So the headline will be Pep popped by Artetta's excellent army. It's puns It's gonna be a pun you know That's the back page Yeah Okay David When's the next issue Come out So I might not be there Because I'll be across The Way at Amfield Where Liverpool will win And I will see Arsenal not winning at the Etihad therefore the headline will be Arta great delivery much better in audio form than it will be on the papers Natalie so I think the headline will be about Artetta and I think it'll be because he'll be moaning about something or complaining about something or gesturing about something. But I also think from City's perspective, it will be Harland because people have started to doubting. People have started, as if they don't remember last season, what's wrong with people? I think he's going to thrive. I think he's going to do brilliant. I think he's going to get a hat trick. I think he's going to shut people up. So it will be Artetta cries as Harland thrives. I like it. All right. Lewis Hamilton has, I'm he's going to shut people up. So it'll be Arteta cries as Harland thrives. I like it. All right. Lewis Hamilton has, I'm sure you know, joined celebrity dating at Raya. If, and I do accept that this is a big if, you were taking the multiple Formula One champion on a hot date. Where are you taking him? And why? Paul. I am taking Lewis to the Lauriston, which, as we all know know is the best pub in Glasgow, just south of the river. Best Guinness outside of Ireland. We'll sit in the snug. We'll have a cozy chat. But I will have to remind Lewis that it's cash only in the Lauriston. So all his flashcards are no good there. But don't worry, Lewis. I'll look after you. I'll bring the cash. And you reckon you get first, second base? It depends how well the Guinness goes. Of course it does. I've just been told to move along there. I can't understandably. Natalie. So Rick, I laughed when this question came up because I saw Lewis Hamilton on said dating app this week. Really? Did you swipe? How do you do it? Do you swipe on it? You like. You like. week. Really? Did you swipe? How do you do it? Do you like? You like, you heart it. Did you? Yes, and then I got into my girls' WhatsApp group, told them all that Lewis Hamilton was on Raya. Two of them were also on Raya. They got on there, found him and also liked him. And we're taking it as like a group thing. Like the more of us that like him, the more types of one of us might get liked back. So hang on, it's actually a small if. Yes. You might go on a date with it. Yes. And so if Lewis wants to go on a date with me, he's vegan and vegetarian. We can go out in Manchester to a nice vegan vegetarian restaurants. We'll share a linking there. If it goes well, I'm going to invite him back to my place to play Mario Kart. My son's got Mario Kart and I need some help! Also, the idea of a date ending with you and Lewis and your son, by America, is very pleasing. Well, keep us posted on that, please. David. Where would I take him? I would take him to somewhere I think that anyone I was dating needs to go, which is the National Portrait Museum. Have you got some work in there? After this show, I'm hoping so. There'll be one of you, Rick. Oh! In our dashing cardigan. Unbelievable. Dashing cardigan. Thank you. Thank you. He repeated. He was reading. He was reading. But then the thing is, I think Lewis is probably used to fine dining, fine cuisine. I would need to take him to a place which has been featured on BBC radio. Sands Caff in Liverpool. And if you've not been there, where Everton have put that monstrosity and cost Liverpool its city of heritage title, that new stadium that's filming. Sands Caff is... Good fight, yeah, terrible. Four years this Caff's been there. The lady who owns it is from China, speaks with a Scouse accent. They do the best spring rolls and some other stuff. I love that. Paul? I've done it. Yes, you have. Just checking in. You're all right? You're all right, mate? Test won't you go? Thank you. Thank you, Paul. I think Lewis Hamilton is probably bored of the finest stuff in life. I think he's like, you know what? Give me something different. Didn't know he was vegan before I put this answer together. But I'm going, Vankees, fried chicken and a night bus. And I think he'd maybe put his veganism on hold for a night with me. For you. Yeah, for me. I think he'd do it. For test, hold for a night with me. For you. Yeah, for me. I think he'd do it. For Tess, anything. All right, no more points for that. Let's have a look at the scores then. I mean, this is extraordinary stuff. David, as expected, trailing behind 28. Paul on 29. Natalie on 33. Tess, are you going to throw it away? You're three points clear. You're on 36. Amazing. You're smiling, but you're... He's looks like you go cry. It does. This is emotional for it. So, if you're any other business, it's all right. You are going to be independent and defensive for Tess. So I'm going to start with you. Set the Bar. Okay. WWE wrestling. Big fun. Wrestling. I can't wait. Got my weekend planned. But I'm sick of people who dis-restling. We know it's not real. No one who watches wrestling is going, oh, yeah, it's sports entertainment. You're not watching Game of Thrones and me going, you know, that's not a documentary, right? It's, it's entertainment. We love it. It's nevertheless. People do have to do that with the crown for Americans. Yeah, yeah, they probably do. It's very, very impressive. They are athletes and they are the pinnacle of their sport and entertainment and I love it to bits and the Rock is back and I can't wait. And so what if it's scripted? Is it any more fixed or scripted than fighting talk? Oh, oh, now then. That's cost you a couple of points. Very interesting, Tess. Po. Podcasts. Podcasts. Say no more. Podcasts are fine if they're coming out of a show and it's a nice way to package things up and present it to the world. And I don't mind people coming up with new ideas for new podcasts. Just not everybody all the time. You know that guy in the island, Sande, up in the Orkneys, who ordered too many Easter eggs. And then he had more Easter eggs than there were people on the island. I know the guy, yeah. That's the way it is with podcasts at the minute. Everybody, every politician who retires, every broadcaster who decides to get in, I'm driving on my car, I'm going to make a podcast. Everybody is making podcasts. I enjoy a good podcast, just not all of them all the time. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Also, I think with the guy who ordered the Easter eggs, I'm suspicious. I think you did it deliberately. I think it was a bit of publicity. I think it's a publicity hound. It worked. Yeah, we certainly covered it. Natalie. I just want to take an opportunity to appreciate their good levels of hausery sometimes that happen in the world. I love a bit of housery, a good top quality winding up. Like I'm really here for it. And so I want to appreciate, have you watched the Netflix TV show Three Body Problem? It's just come out. Not yet, but I have read the book. It is number one around the world on Netflix. It's brilliant. And my good friend John Bradley, who was in Game of Thrones, is one around the world on Netflix. It's brilliant. And my good friend John Bradley, who was in Game of Thrones, is one of the lead characters. And he's brilliant in it. John Bradley is a Manchester United season ticket holder. He lives in Manchester, goes to Manchester United on a regular basis. In the show, the creators who knew that he was a Manchester United season ticket holder made him a city fan. And it's glorious. He opens his laptop and up pops the city badge and I'm looking knowing how painful it is for him and I'm loving it. That's very funny. Also I'm just going to take a point of myself for saying I'd read the book. I don't know why I said it. David. Council grass cutters. Okay. I'm going to have to expand on this please. Yeah, I'm going to have to expand on this, please. Yeah, I'm going to have to expand. Two things. One is the paths, the bit of grass by the path. They go on there with their mowers. They just churn it all up. Leave all the crap everywhere. And after a few years, this builds up, and then they have to close the road off to take all the crap off. Right? So why not just collect the crap in the first place rather than having to wait a couple of years to stop everyone in their traffic And have you've written to the council about this I feel like you're kind of man who might have done No, I only phone that guy out with how am I driving? And tell them they're driving really well The other one is when they go on the parks And footballers out there, all that grassroots footballers And if you need a free kick at soccer aid, I might be your man These grassroots footballers, The People on the M, have cut the grass, leaving all these grass chippings. He gets everywhere, absolutely everywhere. And there's clumps of grass all over the place. So you're trying to play, like your Blackburn Rovers, back in 19. When did you win something? 1995, you know when. Yeah. We'll be you in the last game. And these clumps of grass are just getting in a way, so you can't be like Robbie Savage. Did he play for white? Condemming the working man. Well, we don't even really have. In the podcast section, we'll talk about your free kick, actually, David. Which was a known goal, and I think you know it was. The VAR. The final scores, David, on debut. Coming in, a creditable last. People always come last off, though. don't worry about that, David. It's a bit nice having you on. Paul, not good from you actually. A very fine fighting talker, 32. Tess, pipped to the win, but nevertheless, in Defend the Indefensible on 34, Natalie on 37. He just gave me the finger. Meaning, which one? Tess and Nat go into Defend the Indefensible. This is a ridiculous statement. It's stupid, you have to defend it, it doesn't matter. How much it hurts, I want to see the pain in your eyes. If I say I, I mean you. Nat, you scored the most points. What am I going to give you here? Yes, okay. It's us. I hope Arsenal beat Manchester City on Sunday, as it will be better for football. Of course it will be better for football, because everybody loves an underdog story, and Arsenal are clearly massive underdogs. Nobody wants to see the same team winning everything every single year. Everybody loves Mikhail Artetta. Everybody loves soccer. Everybody hates Pep. Everybody hates Harland. Everybody hates Manchester City. 115. Do we need to say anything else, Rick? They don't deserve it. Arsenal deserve it. Football needs a new champion. Bring it. Give it to London. I like zero and you say 115. That was very pleased actually. Tess, you have 20 seconds on this. I hope Andy Murray carries on playing as long as possible, as I really enjoy watching him get injured. Yeah, it's hilarious. People think Andy Murray doesn't have a personality, but all of his personality is in his knees. And so watching his knees every single year, groan and mourn under the weight of knowing that he didn't win enough championships that could be considered in the top four, because it was a top four when he was playing. We all know that it wasn't really the top four because it was a top four when he was playing we all know that it wasn't really a top four it was a top three he was a nearly man a journey man stop great to finish on stop i'm going to give it to give it to i'm obviously i'm not going to give it to tess i I'll give it to Natalie because, to be fair, I agree with everything you said. And also I can do whatever I like. Tess. So this means actually interesting for stats fans. You were a late replacement. Nat, thank you very much for coming in. It's the sixth time this season we've had a late replacement who's coming and won it. There's a lesson there somewhere. Just playing with freedom, I suppose. This has been a World's End production for BBC Radio 5 Live. And now, after the news, it's 5.5 sports. Shut up. Thank you. Any points now? Hello, you're listening to the podcast extra of Fighting Talk. Quite a lot of stuff to get into, actually. First of all, David, you were asking how many points you got? Why? Because I believe I've got more points in this than I did on any week at Strickley. Wow. Were you rubbish on Strictly? No, no, I got a 10 in the Placoblo. Did you really? Congratulations. A combined total of 10. I can't. Right. Now, yes, what do I want to talk about? A bit of beef between Tess and Paul. Are you two friends again? Yeah. Well, I am. I wouldn't go that far. Oh, he's still there in lingering results. You've got to leave it on the pitch, Paul. Got to leave it in the pitch, mate. Still in the studio. Yes, good point, actually. We are still amazingly. We're not going to swap shirts at the end. Please, God, don't do that. Now, a couple of questions that we didn't have time for. First of all, who is the greatest to do it with an egg-shaped ball? David. There's only one answer. Tom Brady. Yeah, I think you're probably right. Tom Brady. I'm not going to give out points here, but that is a good answer. He won everything and just looked fantastically good at winning everything lovely looking man natalie Gavin hastings and obviously captain of Scotland Lions and the last time that what you're laughing at Scotland Scotland Scotland all right Hartfordshire calm down all right England softwrails I got to say David very much gets a spirit of this show it's a natural so okay so you're going from Joan All right, Watford. I've got to say, David very much gets a spirit of this show. It's a natural. So, okay, so you're going from Joan Leum to Gavin Housings. Fine, Paul. Brian O'Driscoll, 135 caps, 133 caps. Eighty-three is capped, then 62% win rate is capped. That's a very Tesla-like answer. Can we just lift that notepad up, by the way, and share it with everyone. No wonder he can't read his own writing, Rick. Look like that. What is that? Yeah, but that's a journalist. That's a journalist. That's his Donald Trump. Award yourself a trophy. Tess? I'm going Jean Alamo. I think when all of said and done, I think Patrick Mahomes will surpass Tom Brady and look better. Do you reckon? Yeah. What, in the future? When all the Tom Brady and look better. Do you reckon? Yeah. What, in the future? When all is that's what I mean? Is this postcard? That's what, that's what? When I said, when all is said and done, that's what that means? Is it what that means? Is it what? When I said, when I said and done. I gave my answer, Joan Alomou, and then I give a qualifying answer. Can we live in a president? See, the Blackburn 95 or-Rin 95 or 2038? Listen, Blackburn Rovers have as many Premier League titles as Liverpool, so pipe down. Yeah, that is really painful that's so true. Yeah. And Blackburn Rovers have won one more league title at Anfield than Liverpool have. Blackburn, primary-le-title as. Was losing. Yeah. Thank you, Jim Redna. Did you train with the Seahawks for a bit? I did. Why? Okay. I went out with another egg-shaped legend, Martin Johnson. Went out to the United States for a couple of weeks to have a look at the NFL. New York to see the referees, Miami to the rookie symposium, Seattle and San Francisco, Seattle went to train with the Seahawks. The amazing thing is I only had one cross-trainer in the biggest gym I'd ever seen. Shocking. And he said, we don't need cardio. The average play is three and a half seconds. Wow. When you were training, were you just training out of interest or were you thinking I could have a go at this? Just out of interest. My friend at West Ham got me in touch with Seahawks and he said it would be an interesting comparison to see how a goalkeeper in football had so many similar traits to different positions in NFL. Yeah, what would you? A receiver? I was kicking 55-yard field goals. I mean, that was just like, the warm-up in trainers. You've got to like the sniff. Interesting. I went to Miami and I was just hurling this ball, you know, like 70-odd yards or whatever. And the general manager came out and said, you've got a good arm. And I'm like, yeah, he said you'd be no good for us. Because we play short. And I'm like, oh. Oh, right like oh oh okay and all of a sudden the short game is really different bit like golf um which is not a sport boarding sport truth it's a pastime it's not hang on what about snooker pastime shut up thoughts I love I love snooker but you can't how can it be a sport when you wear it a tuxedo what if they wore something different what shorts and t-shirt yeah I love snooker. But you can't, how can it be a sport when you wear, you wear a t-sadot? What if they wore something different? What, shorts and t-shirt? Yeah. No, still wouldn't count. And socks. What? Pull up their socks in the knees. By your definition of sport is only what you wear as opposed to what you do. It's not only, but that has quite a lot to do with it. What about a t-shirt in the World Cup? Would you be a sports person if you're playing for Cameroon? Cameroon, yeah. A little vest. Yeah, a little vest than that. Good question. It's not only about... It is not only about... It is... His whole world views Cumberland right before our eyes. It's not only about the attire, but the attire has a lot to do with it. Like, I like chess. Would you consider chess a sport? No. Well, actually, see, chess can be played by a computer. A computer doing something is that a sport? No. But what people do it is? What are we doing now? I don't know. I don't know about esports. What are we doing now? I don't know. God knows. Has he's the voice of reason. You've got a remote control. Okay, let's move it on. Because as Tess rightly points out, what are we doing here? Louis Ruce Sammett is about to sign for the Kansas City Chiefs. So most unlikely success story in sport. Louis Rue. Nothing from you? Louis who? Louis Riesmett. Who's that? Welsh rugby player. Oh, that's everything. We've never had this. What's this question? This is new this. You don't want to, you don't want to, okay. God forbid ask you a question. You haven't had times of practice. Go on, let him. Go on. Louis Salmon. Louis, if you like. Some Welsh egg guy. Some Welsh egg guy. Yeah. Has gone over to the NFL. Yeah. And he might sign. Some Welsh egg guy has gone over to the NFL and he might sign. I think he's going to sign for the Kansas City Chiefs, not necessarily get on the roster. So I want the most unlikely success story in sport because when it was announced that he was going to go over on the eve of the Six Nations, so give up rugby and go and try and play American football. American football people basically said, yeah, good luck. Never going to happen. And although it still might not, it's going quite well for him. So most unlikely success story in sport. Improv, please, Tess. I'm going to go with Pakistan hero legend, one of the greatest cricketers of all time, In Zamammal Hack. He entered Pakistan cricket at a massive six foot four when a lot of Pakistan cricketers run that tall. And just slightly chubby as well. And didn't set the world on fire initially, but Imran Khan stuck with him. He came good in the semis and the final and then never lost his place for 20 years. It's actually a good answer on the improv, Paul. I am going to say Jose Marino. Jose went in as translator, not as any kind of coach for Bobby Robson, and then started to learn about coaching and went through coaching, wasn't particularly high-level footballer, and then became one of the great managers of all time. Yeah, another good answer on the improv. He's Natalie. Natalie looks terrified. I've got nothing that's as good as those two. Why has Jamie Vardy come to my head? How weird is that? Why would Jamie Vardy come to my head? How weird is that? Why would Jamie Vardy ever pop into anybody's head? Well, I think you could sort of say that he got started very late. But then Ian Wright would be a good answer for that, wouldn't he? Ian Wright is my answer. Is it now? Is it now? Yeah, that's definitely my answer. So fighting talk relies on being scripted like wrestling, does it. No one is saying that fighting talk is a sport. Paul, did? We're all suitably attire. Well, you are. All right, comedian. No one is saying that fighting talk is a sport. Paul, pulled it, because we're all suitably attired. Well, you are. They're all sweating. David, have you got an answer for it? Well, Clive Allen went out to do NFL kicking. Did he? He did. That guy scored a lot of goals. I'm not sure he scored many field goals. No. So my one is Happy Gilmore. Yeah. He won all those prizes. He beats super Gavin in the final and he got his mum of house. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. And a car full of big checks. Here's one that you have, you have prepared. So are you happy with that Tess? Yeah. Much happy. How would you playfully update a sporting bit of kit to cause the maximum amount of upset to fans. Natalie, first please. Well, Manchester United are desperately trying to get back into the glory days. They want to be everything that Manchester City is these days. They're trying to steal our staff. They're trying to steal our everything. They wish that they were Manchester City right now, basically. And so I would make their new home kit, sky blue. The fans would love that. And a sky blue kit, make them wear it. Make the fans would love that and i sky blue kit make them wear it make the fans wear it you're gonna copy us paul then you might as well properly copy us oh yeah i'm glad that uh i'm responsible for united's kit thank you i to cause a maximum annoyance to the maximum number of people i would take the three lions keep them on your shirt but shave them all the lions are now hairless that would really There's actually few things creepier than a hairless Tess I would do two things one I'd put capes on goalkeeper jersees so but they're flying through the air I thought oh my God imagine David James is like those portraits So they're flying through the air. Oh my God. Imagine David James is like those portraits of David James flying through the air. And then he could blame it on when he couldn't get up to save Eric Cantonar's goal, he could blame it on someone standing on his cape. Wow. I got tangled in my cape. Yeah. And also I'd put pictures of bottles on South Africa's cricket kits because they bottled every single one day to one we've ever been in. All right. David. Interestingly, when I played for Portsmouth, I had a haircut, which is my favourite haircut, and I called it him a Superman haircut. Hang on, which haircut was that? Quite Kent. I'm trying to picture it. It was a side part. It was a side part. To be fair to you, shockers. Oh, thank you. It was a side party. Anyway. I would, in the world of cricket, I would have different coloured cricket balls so no one could see. I think if you really, like, camouflage. Green? Yeah, yeah, yeah. So the guy who's bowling, it knows he's bowling it, and then no one else can see it. It's just annoyed people. And as long as you had a little sponsor's logo on it, big issue. Sort of the definitive David James answers to a question there because I don't think I was talking about the equipment uh he's giving you said the kit yes but I meant kit if I went into a cricket shop and I said can I some cricket kit they would give me some bats pads and balls yeah maybe you're right maybe you're right, actually. I'll let you off there. Ding, ding. And one last thing, let's talk about your free kit goal. Got a lot of coverage. It was, it barely made the goal. Come on. It hit the post and it went in off the goalkeeper. Not your goal. No, no, no, no. That is what happens. I don't know with grassroots, right? He was wet. The guy on the mower, obviously hadn't mowed it properly. Disgusting. I don't know how they get away. And we're playing this game. I could just give you a quick story. So I end up playing this game. It's a football reboot, all this stuff. They'd collect loads of boots. We can just fade out. You can fade back on again. We're playing this game. I'm playing a goal first half. Winning 1-0. Second half, go out on field. They have two penalties. Keep a save the first one, and then they hit the post, and then he saves a rebound for the second one. So it's one all, going into the last few minutes, and we've got this free kick, and I've got up to Will, and I've gone, you're going to wait it? He went, oh, I'm not going to wait it. So you have a shot in it? He's gone, well, if you want to shoot, I have a shot, and I'm like, all right, then. I've sized up the keeper. Mm-hmm. Looked like a Sockery keeper from a couple of years ago. World Strongest Man, Big Beard, massive. And I've just looked at the pitch and all the bobbles and all the potholes and stuff. Mm-hmm. And thought a low shot would be better and hit it. And it was like everyone on the field looked at it. It was like, where is this ball going? And there was a little bend at the end. And I think this might hit the post and I was going to be happy with the post. And then it hit the keeper and went in. But I thought the keeper was on the line and everyone else did and they gave me the goal. There was no VAR and the video didn't come out until a couple days later. Video's pretty conclusive though, isn't it? I've seen the video and I just think the angles aren't really, really great. What game is this? What game is this? What game is this? This is a grassroots football. So, Sunday league. Huttwood, I was saying this is a proper Sunday league match for Huttwood down in Southampton versus, I called them Made of Wood. Made of something. Whatever their name was. Midd and head. You were trash talking at the Sunday league. That's nice. Mid and head? I'll watch the penalty takers as well. I said, don't go left. Don't go left. Shout now. And he went left and missed. Middenhead. You were trash talking at the Sunday League, that's nice. Middenhead? Oh, what's to the penalty takers as well? I said, don't go left, don't go left! Shout now and he went left and missed. I told you. Yeah, and I... I think maybe I don't want to be your friend, actually, David. No, no, no, you got to do on a pitch? Oh, okay, yeah, fine. Was it not tempted to be like, David, you want to go back and goal for this one? For the pens? Yeah. No, because I trusted the goalie. They know his pen's saving record as well, so I don't know quite really. Hey, Rick, I didn't want to say it right at the start either because I didn't want to put you off, you letting me win. Yeah. I think David and I are actually friends. Do you? We're friends. Yeah, yeah. Is that right? David once gave me a gift. Hang on. What did you give her? Candles. From eBay? Four candles. Yep. And you missed the nice part, the part that I really liked is he gave me them in like a denim, like a carrier bag. And I said, do you want your bag back? And he said, no, I made that for you. Made? What? I do sewing as well. I'm a tough thing machine is broken. What is happening? I don't know. I think we're going to have to leave it there because I don't know why David Jones is going around. Can you rerun the final again? I made bags for candles. Of course. He doesn't make bags for a candle. And they're wonderful, gorgeous candles. I love them. Well, look, I'm going to go home. I can't listen to any more. I'm getting on to cardigans. Thanks, thanks, everyone. This is why everyone should not have podcasts. Agreed, agreed, agreed. Agreed. Let's take a journey back to 2003. Canadian Teen Sensation Aver Levine was topping the charts and turning the music industry upside down. But what if I told you that the Avalovine we know and love might not be the same Averill? What? Did Averill die? Was she replaced by a doppelganger? I'm Joanne McNally and I'm doing a deep dive into a notorious internet conspiracy. Who replaced Averlovene? Listen on BBC Sounds."}
