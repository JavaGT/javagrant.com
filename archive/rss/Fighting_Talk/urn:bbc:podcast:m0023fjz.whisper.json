This podcast is supported by advertising outside the UK. BBC Sounds, music, radio, podcasts. I'm Josh Whitakam and this is Fighting Talk. Yes, for one morning only, I am back as the host of Fighting Talk. Coincidentally coincided with the announcement of my nationwide tour, but let's not let that dominate proceedings or lead to bonus points for mentioning. This is my 49th time in the FT chair. Tantalising, Pizza Gate awaits for number 50. My last show was an Olympic special in 2016 and was won by a little-known TV host, a pretty boy named Rick Edwards. Winter Day and you could be hosting the show in 2032. Let me give you some names to start. Dalglish at Liverpool. Ronaldo at Man United. Staruk at Plymouth. What do they tell us? Never go back. Yeah, here I am. Unable to resist returning to the lit firework of sports punditry. Can we go against the lessons of history? Well, I'm amongst friends. I've asked the fighting talk producers to give me my four favourite panellists on my return. Unfortunately, none of those were available. A bit fun. Oh, come on now. Come on. You've got to enjoy the tapins, haven't you? Set your watch by him. So who is on? First up, show 33. Third under my chairmanship, having finished last in the previous two. It's Italian a football aficionado, Mena Razuki. Just goes to show you how much Rick likes me. It does, doesn't it? Yeah, that is... I feel bad about that. I was a winner under Colin. And this is just... No. Yeah, so I'm hoping, I hope, you know, we have a nice, healthy relationship today. Well, do you know what? You're sitting much closer to me than anyone was sat close to me. I don't know what's happened to the studios at the BBC. I think the producer's trying to tell you something today. Well, let you know what? You're sitting much closer to me than anyone was sat close to me. I don't know what's happened to the studios at the BBC. I think the producers trying to tell you something today. Well, let's see. Someone slightly further away, making his third appearance on Fighting Talk. He won his debut. He came second next time out. Yeah. Can he continue to come worse on each show? You're heading in the right direction. This is great. Tour de France, veteran presenter. It's Ned Bolting. Hello, hello. That music again. Oh, yeah, you'll never escape it. Exactly, this show is nothing if not Route 1. Now, 121 appearances. Wow. That is a life well lived. He has been on seven shows with me hosting, one when we were both panellists. Yeah, Halcyon days. Oh, Halcyon days. A show, it says here, which featured the sentence, and then Grobblah shot him. Dougie is here. It's Dougie Anderson. It's lovely to see you, George. It's good that you're here, and I've been charting your work since you left the FT stable. And I have to be honest, I'm pleased with what I've seen. Oh, thank you. Thank you. Wow. Is there a point available there? I'm not doing the point. Yeah, thank you. Right. Finally, show 37. His debut came when I was the host in 2014. Were we ever so young? And the only one of 19 debutantes that I gifted Victory to. He's won four of the last five DTs. Wow. On tour. Go and see him live. It's much the same shit. He's won four of the last five DTs. Wow. On tour. Go and see him live. It's much the same shit. He'll be getting today. Defending Independents are on tour. You are? He made it sound like I'm doing the DCs on tour. Why not? Why not? It's Ivo Graham. Hello, Josh. Mike, the producer, just pointed at your name because we hadn't made clear to the audience who you were. What's the tour called, Ivo? It was called Grand Designs at the Edinburgh Fringe when I was performing in a venue called The Grand. But it's now been changed to Grand Design due to legal anxieties. Just one grand design. Yes. Kevin McLeod had his lawyers on the phone. Let's get going. First question's all about this. A blistering right hand had deposited Anthony Joshua on the canvas. A towel has come in from Ben Davidson and this contest is over. Moments after that, the camera panned to the ringside and Tyson Fury who said, that cost me 150 million, referring to his chances of proposed future fight with Anthony Joshua. But what have been the other costly moments in sport lately? Let's start with you, Ned. Oh, well, okay, well, with a heavy heart, I've got to go straight. Well, I'm going to just lance the boil because people would be worried at what point I'm going to start talking about cycling. There'll be a lot of dread there. I'll just get it out the way now. Yeah. Tour de France every year. There we go. Tour de France is a three week race for which you are paid at the end of the race. If you win, if you have a good fortune to win, half a million quid or thereabouts, right? Which would seem like, yeah, that's what you get, it's a prize money, which would seem like, all right, for three weeks' work. But then you have to think about the work that's involved in actually winning the race, you know, being chased by 175 other blocs up and down mountains and that sort of thing. It's the kind of money that if you're a golfist, you'd kind of earn just for wearing a pair of salmon, pink trousers, and a sunbeiser and walking through the lobby of a Saudi hotel, right? Yes. You get your half a million quid for winning in Tour de France, stand on the podium in the Chancesileise with your yellow jersey, and then you find out that tradition dictates, and it's very traditional sport, that you have to hand over all of your prize money to your seven teammates who helped you get there in the first place, including, including in the case of Bradley Wiggins in 2012. He had to hand out a large amount of his prize money to Chris Frum, who was busily plotting his downfall throughout the entire three weeks and trying to beat him on that way. So there you go. It makes you feel for Hans Armstrong even, doesn't it? Yeah. Dougie. You break even. I'm reminded to hear of a story from earlier on this year that of a scaffolder. Oh yeah. Holt me. Scaffolder who decided to cash out. Oh no. Ethan Call me, Scaffolder in Wales. It's just to the west of England. And missed out on £814,000 because he cashed out early on his £219 pound bet. He had it for three Premier League scores. It's last day of the season. Brighton, Nill, Man United 2. Liverpool 2, Wolves Nothing. Sheffield United Nill, Tottenham 3. That was the bet. Yeah. 15 minutes to go. All the results, bar one, were in. He just needed Man United to score one goal. Oh, I feel sick. He decided to play it safe. He cashed out. He took 5,130 pounds. If he'd held his nerve, in the 88th minute, Man United got their second, Rasmus Hoyland, completed the hat-trick of results. He needed to wait just 10 minutes, and he would have walked away with 814 grand. In the bank, you can chuck in the scaffolding with 814 grand. Just five grand, you back up the ladders on Monday. Oh, no. Penny's to your dad, Ivo. What's your own? Oh, there's no need for that, Josh. The main person I've benefited from nepotistically in my career is you, and it's lovely to see you again. So, I would like to talk about Aaron Rogers, quarterback and COVID skeptic, who at the start of last season, and I don't know much about American football, but if I do spread any misinformation in this the answer, I'm only following the great man's lead. He tore his Achilles a minute and a half into the first game of last season after transferring from the Packers to the Jets. That costs $37 million, which the Jets could not recoup any of because they hadn't taken out any insurance on him. The Packers had an insurance policy for his entire time with them, and the Jets didn't. So really, this is an answer about insurance, and my father would be very proud. I had actually a similar thing, just when it came to a bet just to mention that on Slovenia and I decided to cash out because I thought England weren't going to do it and then Bellingham scored. And I got about 500 quid. But anyway, my story is about the championship playoff final at Wembley. Adam Armstrong scored the only goal of the game in the first half as Southampton defeated Leeds United 1-0 in the playoff in Wembley. Adam Armstrong scored the only goal of the game in the first half as Southampton defeated Leeds United 1-0 in the playoff in Wembley Stadium. Southampton received 140 million, which will increase to more than 305 million if the club avoids relegation this season. Will it, though, is the question. Wow. Yes, let's hope not. Let's hope not. Now, it's question two, and obviously that comes from you, the listeners. This week's question two listeners on the line. Hello, Peter Stones from Worcestershire. Are you there? I am there, Josh. Hi. Hello. Any relation to John? I don't know. Maybe. Not a relation that I know. Oh, it's a shame. We've got a song for you, obviously. Do we like to hear it? Of course. Yeah, it's a shame. We've got a song for you, obviously. Do we like to hear it? Of course, yeah, please. There it is. There it is. The totally needless cover of like a Rolling Stone that the Rolling Stones will be. It's about 30 years too late. Yeah. Mainly because they felt they had to. What's your question, Peter? My question is mentioning no other podcast. Yeah. Which sportsperson would have made parenting help when they were younger? It's a good question. It's a good question. Which sports person would have made parenting help? Put it in your podcast apps. If they, well, as a child, I will start with you, Mina. It's got to be Zlatan Ibrahimovich, right? Can you imagine Zlatan as a kid referring to himself after the third person? Zlatan doesn't like baby food. And also he's just one of those people who talks about endlessly how people confront him on the pitch by slanging off his mom. I don't want to be slagged off on the pitch, to be honest with you. He says things like he recently said, I am the boss when talking about his relationship to Milan direct and ownership. I am the boss and I am in charge. All the others work for me. And you just kind of imagine that's the kind of stuff that he'd be saying to you every day. When the lion goes away, the kittens arrive. When the lion comes back, the kittens disappear. It's almost like, it's kind of like a weird Peter Drury sort of Shakespearean thing as well, you know, like sometimes the way that he speaks. And he, when he talked about proposing to his wife, they were like, you know, what did you give her? Like, what was, what was the ring? And he goes, what ring? She got Zlatan. And I kind of imagine that's the kind of stuff he'd say to me all the time. So, yeah, if I'm having to choose one, it's not going to be Zlatan. It's a good choice. It's a good choice, Dougie. Well, you worry as a parent, don't you? And I say that having no children at all, but I believe that's the case. You do worry, and the worrying never stops. But if your child says, I want to be a Formula One driver, that's a financial worry, the money that goes into supporting that dream, but also the danger involved, the chicanery. And I think coupled with that, it doesn't get any better, does it, when they actually become a Formula One driver? You're watching your son just go around at 100 miles an hour with death knocking at the window. And what's worth in death knocking at the window is perhaps a plucky Brit trying to get up the standings and knock you off number one. I'm talking from the position of the parent, of course, of Max Verstaffin, who's got Lando Norris just knocking at the door trying to get to number one. You, Lando, he probably says, if I may quote from Spaced Season 2. You Landau, won for the comedy Cognoscentia there. And Cognoscentia, of course, one for the Italian listeners. If you haven't seen season one or two, just get on spaced. It is still the gift that keeps giving. Hold on. So you're saying you don't want to be Max Vastappen's parent? Yes, yes. Do you know much about his dad? Yeah. I wouldn't want to be Max Vastappen. Yeah. Ivo. Well, I hate to sort of launch into the awkward Vastappan moment with something a bit more frivolous, but this is less about what they would have been like as a kid. And now, I would say I wouldn't want to be the parents of Kyle Walker. No one thinks your son should play for England. You've got so many grandchildren to look after. And he's hosting all these parties you're not invited, too. He's absolutely gushing. I'm still captivated the idea of Peter Drury as a child. That'd be amazing, isn't it? Hello, Mom! Every morning. Feminity of Rome. Peter, bless you. No, I think it would be appalling, frankly, to be the parent, I the parents, of the British Olympics skateboarder Andy McDonald's who competed at the Paris Summer Olympics at the age of 51. Now, a rough calculation, that's going to put his parents in the kind of 75 to 80 age bracket. And they, at that ripe old age, have still got to pretend that they're somehow impressed with the antics of their child. Who is 51 and is still skateboarding. Come out of your room, Andy! No! What are you going to do? Go and meet your friends down the shopping centre. Do anything, Andy. Andy McDonald, what an embarrassing son to have. Peter, who are you going to give the points to? I mean, it's definitely not Dougie, because being a parent of an F1 driver, it'd be amazing for travel around the world. You're just wrong, Peter. You're just wrong, is it? You also only gave one answer, which is pretty poor from you. Yeah, Mina gets the point. I mean, Latton famously stole bikes to get to training as well. What a pain to be awful as a child. Thank you very much for Latta. Cheers, thank you. Thanks, everyone. Have a nice week. Cheers. Now, there's yellow weather warnings for extreme rain across the UK. Wimbledon's ground flooded. It's been wet, wet, wet. But when have you seen sport improved by rain, Ivo Graham? I think the only thing that redeemed England not qualifying for Euro 2008 was Steve McLaren having to use an umbrella. And who's to say how much of a factor that played in his dismissal? But I think that really sealed the deal. And I think we have to be grateful that the rain that night brought an end and quite a sort of iconic end to one of the bleak periods of English managerial history. And he's now, of course, in lovely hot climbs. Best of luck to him. Seal it up, man. Ned. I'm going to go football as well. And it's a memory from my early years as a football reporter at Sky. I went in August 1999 to the famous Tyne Weir Derby when Rood Hullet in his Gucci suit was standing at the side of the pitch. And he left Alangira on the bench. And then in comes the famous Peter Reed Sunderland team. There is a deluge at St James's Park like I've never seen. We're handed in the press box these totally substandard Newcastle United ponchos that do nothing to keep the rain off. We watch in horror as Nile Quinn glances a header in and then Kevin Phillips somehow while simultaneously falling on his ass in the box curls a winning goal right into the top right hand corner and Rude Hullet is sunk without a trace and the rain just added an intense amount of drama to what was already an extraordinary night of action at St James. I think they're the two most iconic choices have already gone. So, Mina, what are you going for? God, I feel like you're Peter Drew Roos brother. I'm just not a big fan of the rain, so I can't think of any sport. And regardless of what producer who's hammered me about this, it says, I'm just not even if it's in Formula One. But I will tell you one thing. Super Bowl, Jen Ziers won't remember this because it was 2007. Super Bowl halftime show. And it was Prince, the greatest halftime show ever. And then he comes on, first time it's ever rained in when he was singing Purple Rain. I mean, could you think of anything more iconic in a halftime show than to have friends sing that song, Purple Rain? And then for it to start raining, for the first time ever, by the way, in a half-time show. That's got to be the most iconic moment. Do you know, the producer Simon just told me that he was there, Clang. Have we got a clang sound effect? Was he really? And he just told me, he thought it was an effect. Because he's thick. Do you know what? Because he's thick. You know what? Because he's a boomer. He thought they had made it raid. No word of a lie. The Rolling Stones once did the Super Bowl half-time. Did not play like a rolling stone. Start me up. They started with start me up. Of course I did. They know how to please a crowd, Dougie. Yeah, well, football or rugby is always better in the rain because it obviously creates jeopardy and comedy. Who could forget the classic John Terry penalty slip 2008. Oh, that was great. Absolutely. But let's spare a thought for one of those great unsung heroes of football. The club official on the touchline, getting soaked but ready. Perhaps lurking under his cagul is the dry towel to give to a player before the throw-in for the all-important ball rub to aid gripping. Oh, love it. Love it. Now today is ask a stupid question day and the day to embrace your ignorance and not be shy about learning something new. For instance, it's not possible to change the weather. What in sport does everyone else seem to understand but remains a mystery to you, Mina? I'm going to ask you guys a question because this happened to me last year and me, the commentator and a few other people on the pitch side didn't understand this. So what happens when you get a penalty mid game in a football match? You strike it and it hits the woodwork and then comes back and then you the same player can't touch it, right? What about you? The same player can't touch it. I'm going to have no idea but Josh said it like he clearly knew what I was talking about. I just remember that. Why are you just copying him? Yeah, absolutely copy him. You know this rule. No, I've got no idea. If the goalkeeper were to save it and it came back, the player who took the kick could then... Rebound it. Yeah, rebound it. But if it's off a post or I believe a bar... Yes. Yes, it's got to be another player, I think. Yeah. I'm looking at Ivo now. I'm going to go points down for this, I think. Because I knew something. I thought you said, ask a quite dumb question. Yeah, no, no, fair as you know what? The whole point is, back up. Back up. Yeah to be stupid yeah yeah double points yes thank you very much no but i don't i think that is a good point no one knew but i've i read the you are the ref back in the day oh yes because it's the same player that touches it you're not allowed to touch it twice in a row unless it's changed has it i thought it's changed we're all like woohoo because're all like, woo-hoo, because it was like an important thing, yeah? And then it was like, no, no, because it hit the crossball. How do none of you know this rule? And we're like, oh, this is so embarrassing. So did they get to, did they retake it? No, it's a foul. And it's given a free kick to the other team. Yeah, there you go. Can you come up with three as divisive questions as that? Dougie. Well, from my point of view, absolutely not. Well, for a couple of years now, only because I never really heard it been spoken about ever before on TV is the high press, or they've gone for a high press there. That's dangerous with the high press. I do not recall this being mentioned, spoken about as a child. And, you know, it sounds like it should be a gymnastic event, the high press, not something in football. Lovely, dismount from the high presser. The judges will be impressed with that high press. I don't get it. It's pundits speak. And they don't seem to realise that you're never going to be in a football ground beside someone who's screaming at their own team. What's with the high press? It is never going to happen and here's something can you answer me this on the subject of pundits when did pundit pumps become a thing i'm talking of course about the black trainer with a prominent white song they are all wearing them and when will they realize that gentlemen oh there we go the pundit pumps but ned you're not wearing it with a suit that's true i'm not wearing it with a suit. That's true, I'm not wearing it. No need. They need to remember the gentlemen prefer brogues. Ned. Rugby. I watched rugby as a kid back up. Is your hansett just rugby? Yeah, pretty much. Because I watched it as a kid. So, that's a hallelujah for you. Yeah, absolutely, back in the day of mud and people who were a bit overweight running around and pints at light. And then it disappeared behind a paywall for a couple of decades, didn't it? And it suddenly reappeared rugby, and it's caught my attention over the last couple of years. And everything has changed. Everything has changed about it. Including that mystifying bit. No, it's crap. Oh, right. The bit where they hoof the ball really high into the air. That can go on for about 20 minutes, kind of. But then one player at the back, that can go on for about 20 minutes, kind of... Yeah. But then one player at the back, I think they're called the fallback, catches the ball, right? Out of the air like that. And instead of then getting fallen upon by all the other players, he just stops the game. Yes. He does a thing called calling for a mark. What's that all about? You don't just do that in sports? I've just done something really good. Now everybody stop and admire it while we just take a pause to reflect on it. I do not understand what that's all about. Ivo. Well, I mean, I think XG, I think it's probably quite a common thing for this and things that don't need to exist and things that I don't understand. And also, I think I kind of back myself to sort of outlast XG. Like, I don't think I ever have to learn what it. I think it will just be quietly dropped at some point in shame. I would also add to that golf handicaps. I don't really understand how they work. And I, again, consider it a point of pride. I want to get as far in my life as possible without really understanding what a golf plan is. You're going to have to really, for your gig tonight, you're going to have to know all about golf handicaps, aren't you, for your small talk? I suppose so, Ned. But perhaps we can talk about this afterwards. Well, let's have the scores. Let's have the scores. And Ivo would be in the lead with a handicap of three, but he is in last place with 14. Dig-go on 15, Mina on 16. Ned leads the way on 17. It's all very close, isn't it? It's all very close, isn't it? It's all very close. Very close. NFL team, the Jack Stewart, Jacksonville Jaguards, appeared on the Showcase Network TV broadcasts on Monday Night Football this week, was slaughtered by the Buffalo Bills 4710, in what some pundits called the worst performance on Monday night football they could remember. Following the defeat, their plane developed technical problems and they were delayed leaving Buffalo for three hours. What have been your own personal travel nightmares in the name of sport? Ivo, I have to start with you, a man whose life is travel nightmares. Yeah, well, and it wasn't even me who missed the train to Carlisle on the 5th of August 2017. It was my friend Stu, and I was livid with him, because it's very rare that the fixture calendar lines up that you can go and watch a match away at Carlisle during the Edinburgh Fringe. And because we missed the train, we just went to watch Hibu. I pushed so hard to go to Carlisle for the second half, but no one has ever gone to Carlisle for the second half. So we went to watch Heberny and beat Part of Kistle instead, and it was lovely to go to Easter Road. But then miraculously, five years later, I got another chance. Swindon got Carlisle away in August again. And this time, it was really tight with my show. And I made it to the game, and I made it back. But a lot of people at the Pleasants were very unhappy with me. Dougie. Such a nice for Ivo to mention game and I made it back, but a lot of people at the Pleasants were very unhappy with me. Dougie. Such a nice for Ivo to mention Habernian there, and I feel I should carry on with this, because I think it doesn't have to be long haul, does it? A problematic journey. In fact, trying to hide your green and white hibs scarf while navigating public transport in Glasgow after a way game at Rangers Ibrox is as terrifying an ordeal as it gets. But the first time I ever went to Glasgow was in 1985 and I know what you're thinking, Ned, and you're right. Taggart was a big hit at the time. Glasgow was the place to be. Hibs were playing Alex Ferguson's Aberdeen, lost 3-0, supporters bus with my father. I was very young on the way out of Glasgow, attacked by Rangers supporters. Hibs fans get off the bus to have a running battle in the street, then everyone back on the bus, and off we went to Edinburgh. Terrifying. Terrifying, Ned. Again, I go back to my early years at Sky Sports, and I was off to do Saturday afternoon inserts into Jeff Stelling Soccer Saturday program, reports from the match. I was going to Upton Park, driving with my ISDN kit in the back seat, along the A-13, about to turn off to Upton Park, hit an enormous traffic jam, stationary traffic. I thought, I'm going to miss kickoff here, starting to get back anxious when I noticed the passenger door in a car, two cars ahead of me, open. And this is around about the year 2000, and a teenage Rio Ferdinand got out in his West Ham training kit, about a mile and a half from Upton Park, with his boots flung over his shoulder and started jogging towards Upton Park. Oh my word. He got there in time for kickoff and I didn't. Meena. Oh God, I don't feel like any of them was this exciting. One time. Going to Carlisle. As quick as you can on this, Mina. It's almost the news. So if you don't have much, it's ideal for the show. Champions League, Champions League I was hosting with Colin Murray. Yep. Absolute nightmare. Trying to come back from Anfield. We were stuck in traffic all the way back, all the way to Manchester, then had to go and come back to London. We were so late that I missed my flight because I was going to cover Italy to do an important interview. Anyway, massive delays, got there at night, had to do the late night show for an American broadcaster, finished up four, had to be 6.30 in Juventus headquarters to do three sets of interviews. I had only slept one hour. I arrived and then I looked to the communications director and I said, who's that? That looks so familiar. And I was like, is he an actor or something? He goes, Cristiano Ronaldo. Lovely end of the first half. We're back with more after the news and sport. Welcome back. Panel to Fighting Talk. It is Dougie Anderson, Mina Rizuki, Ned Bolting and Ivo Graham. Two points in it between them all, so everything to play for. Let's get straight on with it. Game change of time, five points to one of you. And you will get to take away five points from one of your opponents. No points for the rest of you. It's that simple. Last time I hosted Fighting Talk, Britain was still in Europe. Rick Edwards was the host of a TV show called Safe Word. Wayne Rooney was playing for England. Oh, let's play also. This didn't exist. This theme tune. We've got buttons now that didn't even exist. I don't really do this. Wayne Rooney obviously now is the manager, unbelievably, of Plymouth Argyle. But what have been the other biggest changes in sport since 2016? We'll start with Mina Azuki. It was Champions League Final, Athletico Madrid versus Real Madrid. Pepe was up to his antics, a centre bank for Real Madrid, and Mark Clattenberg was taking this all very personally. But of course, it was Real Madrid that scored the goal, and it was marginally offside. But who could tell? No one could tell, because you know what? There wasn't VAR. So at the time, when he gifted him that, and then he saw Pepe do his antics and decided to give a penalty to Atletico, it was almost like he was doing two wrongs, don't make a right, and then talks about that in an interview. So it's kind of like two wrongs did make her right, but there was no VAR at the time. And we thought Mark Clattenberg was quite good at the time. Yes. Well, are you going with VAR? It is. Okay, because Mark Clattenberg, the now referee of gladiators, would have been quite a good answer as well. But we're going to go with VAR. Oh, Dougie. No, I'm going to go with Gladys. No, it's too loud. We're laughing. And we're right to laugh. 2016 was a more innocent time. And we've all changed in many ways. Was it? Yes, yes, it wasn't. It was a more innocent time. Do you remember the American election? Only too well. Only too well. But let's move on and be serious. To be fair, the American election? Only too well! Only too well! But let's move on and be serious. To be fair, the American election is exactly the same. I'll give you a couple of three, okay? 2016 was actually the last game at Upton Park, that famous one, West Ham Man United. Upton Park now, of course, just flats. But, you know, since then, West Ham have won more European trophies than Tottenham and Arsenal combined. And in 2016, Andy Murray won Wimbledon and an Olympic gold, and now he's a house husband. Oh, there we go. So which are those six answers, am I going to say? Andy Murray or West Ham. won't take any of them. You can all have two answers. Ned, which two do you want? I'll just go with break dancing as part of the Olympic Games. As you rightly say, I mean, it's simpler times back in 2016 when Josh last hosted this show, the Olympics were geared around simple stuff, like how fast can you run, how can you, you know, fall off in a really straight line from a really high diving board and things like that. How far can you throw heavy things and stuff? And now you can basically win Olympic gold medal for showing off on the dance floor and Inferno's nightclub at 2 o'clock in the morning. I mean, what will they dream up next? Horse dancing? My uncle, who's an Arsenal season ticket holder, tells a lot of stories about this hooligan who used to frequent the Emirates. And he said it was a violent man. He was violent to opposition supporters. He was violent to his own supporters. A trip to the Emirates in 2016 wasn't a trip without seeing this guy in a fight, usually talking about how he was a lawyer so he could get out of anything. Anyway, you wouldn't see that now because that man's name was Keir Starmer. And, of course, now what he'd be here. You know, he's having a sandwich in some box. But in 2016, he was picking fights left, right and centre. Well, there's some good options there. But I think, I mean, Keir Stahmer is a lovely answer. Not based in truth. No, I know. So that's out. We're going to go with a combination of VAR and Mark Clattenberg for the five points, I think. And who would you like to cost five points? Who's winning? Who's winning? You are. But that would be a... Do you want to make a game of it? 10 to 5 points of just giving you off yourself? That would be both exciting. Can we do 2 to 1? No, you've taken the points of yourself. There's no points for anyone in that one. Right. This is me being kind. To the Cold War now, at last. It's Stanislav Petrov Day. This week, a day to remember the man who single-handedly saved the world. It was Stanislav that intervened at the height of tensions in 1983 when I was born and prevented an all-out nuclear war and catastrophic fallout. I love the fact we've added catastrophic fallout. Just to be clear, that would have been a catastrophic fallout. So what are the downsides of nuclear war? Well, the old catastrophic fallout, I suppose. You've all seen the public service films of the time. But who is the Stanislav Petrov of Sport? Who prevented nuclear war and catastrophic fallout? Dougie. Thanks for coming to me first. Aye. But who is the Stanislav Petrov of sport? Who prevented nuclear war and catastrophic fallout? Dougie. Thanks for coming to me first. Ivo. Well, this is all really about the vault fast, the blatant disregard of protocol, the, if you will, seismic shifts. So with all that in mind, here's a sentence I thought I'd never utter. William Webb Ellis is the sporting Stanislav Petrov, because he was, of course, the man who decided, this football thing kicking the ball was nonsense. I'm going to pick it up, hold it, run with it, thus creating the sport of rugby in 1823. Shipped out the rule book. Yes, that is a good one, Ned. I think that the world was in a terrible state about 15 years ago, and we were heading towards an inevitable cataclysm because football, as a project on television, was failing. We had a dearth of interesting pundits. There was a very vanilla line-up, you're Martin Kianz, you're Danny Murphy's, dare I say, you're Lee Dixon's. Into this... You're talking pundit pumps, aren't you? into into into the people still the big names of the BBC I keep it down dad don't you if you watch the coverage of the euros into this mix and into this slide is this sorry yeah yeah I was balancing it out applies to all networks equally but it was dragging the nation's game down you know and and with it I dare I say that there was a risk as people lost interest in football started to turn off the big It applies to all networks equally. But they're dragging the nation's game down, you know. And with it, dare I say, there was a risk, as people lost interest in football started to turn off, that big beluga whale of football would drag with it the kind of ancillary little fish that feed on the skin of big football matches like fighting talk. Because without football, there is no, you know, all of you could have been without a job. We did a nods to other sports, but we don't really care. So this was the cataclysm bearing down on us because people losing into. Into this comes Roy Keene. Oh, yeah. A man who said, I'm never going to go into a football studio, the entire time as a player, came into a football studio, pretty much the first opportunity. I was working for ITV on the first match he did at Wembley. We're all terrified of him, terrified of his beard and terrified of him. But he has reinvigorated football punditry by talking the truth. He is 89% of my Instagram algorithm. There you go. Uh, Mina. Well, this is to Alley the Fears. How do you say that word, Aligh, Leigh? Alley, Alley. Alley the fears of Dougie and his imaginary children who are all Formula One drivers. But it is Sid Watkins. That's where my life is at the moment. Sid Watkins. Formula One's first full-time doctor, new neurosurgeon and the sports medical delegate. He was, well, prior to his coming on board to Formula One in 1978, death was a regular occurrence. And at least one driver would be killed while racing most of those years. He greatly reduced that fatality rate. Of course, in the 12 years prior to Imola, when we did lose Argentinezano and Ratzenberger, he had managed to reduce the fatalities by a huge amount. He was the first professor of neurosurgeon. And he changed the sport because he changed the culture about it. It wasn't seen as Formula One drivers were Playboys that, you know, were doing a risky job and this is what comes with the job. He made sure the sport became a safe thing. And ever since he's been on board since Imola, there's only been one death, which is George Bianchi, who is, of course, was the godfather of Charles LeClerc. But what a hero. He saved Formula One and made it a sport we can all watch. I wouldn't want to have to follow that answer, Ivo. Well, luckily, I can. With something glib. I don't know if you would call a United Nations Goodwill Ambassador Glip. I'm sure there are some glib ones out. But amongst them I would not be... I think Jerry Halliwell was one, wasn't she? She was! Oh God! Well, I can promise you this story is going to take in both a UN Goodwill Ambassador and a popular UK girl group. But how? Let me tell you about Didier Drogpa. Because Didier Drogpa, he is credited with essentially helping the Ivory Coast avoid civil war. After they, it stopped feeling very glib very quickly in the FT studio as the near evasion of the Ivory Coast Civil War has come up. After the Ivory Coast qualified for the 2006 World Cup by defeating Sudan in October 2005, Drogba invited TV cameras into the dressing room, and he spoke directly to the nation. He said, men and women of Ivory Coast, from the north, south, centre and west, we prove today that all Ivorians can coexist and play together with a shared aim to qualify for the World Cup. Today, we beg you on our knees. Within one country in Africa with so many riches must not descend into war. I don't need to read Didiard's whole speech. But as I say, the goodwill ambassadorship was in the post. And the following year, there was an Ivory Coast flag on Girls Aloud's greatest hit. Coincidence? Yes, they meant to do an island flag for Nadine Coyle. They did the Gone way round. Right. Right. Incredible. The next, we did those in the right order, didn't we? You didn't want to be talking about Roy Keene in punditry after those two. The next topic is about this. There's a football match, obviously, it's a great spectacle for the Premier League. Probably not so much certain stuff. I think it's part and parcel of the game and we'll say the dark arts. Appalling son, Kyle Walker there. If you haven't listened to the first half, that is a callback, just to be clear. So it was dark arts that earned Arsenal a point at Man City last weekend, apparently. But who will Arsenal have to top to become the masters of the darkest sporting arts? Mina. We invented it. When you think of dark arts, who are you going to think of other than Italy? Let's be honest. I mean, an Italian football actually has a specific word for it, for Wittia, which means the dark arts. Or it's just being a little bit cunning, let's put it that way. I think there's nothing more fantastic for an Italian football spectator than to watch Giorgio Kalini Yank Saka's shirt in the Euro 2020 final to win Italy the title. And of course, alongside him was Leonardo Bonucci. Do you know what he was famous for? Eating garlic sweets so that he could then breathe on his opponent, and that opponent would want to run away because his breath smelled so awful. That's what those two did, and that's why those two are called Professors of Defence. Bit of trivia for casual racism fans. Mike was just asked to play the Italian National Anthem and play chadap at your face. It's listed in the thing as Italy. That's what it's listed. Wow. We have the Ivory Coast National Anthem when you play sound in the underground. Dougie. Just to say, Josh, as a little extra, I know you're just back as I guess, but you do seem to be enjoying yourself. It's quite good to know that the producers hold nothing over you and you can really. No, from your point of view, I would say it's a very strong eight out of ten. No, the ultimate act, it has to be, it has to lead to a successful outcome for your team. So let's take Sergio Ramos, or as I like to call him, the sporting Alistair Crowley. The 2018 Champions League Final against Liverpool, there was beauty in his deviousness, that apparent innocuous coming together with Mo Salah, Salah thens out the game, Liverpool's chances of winning in Tatters, Ramos knew what he was doing, that kind of arm lock, Salas' shoulder, forcing him down, dislocating said shoulder. Salas's off the pitch. He's in tears, knowing his work, you know, he's done for the season. That is a true deployment of the dark arts. Arsenal could learn from it. Win at all costs. Channel the greatest of the mall. Sergio Ramos. There we go. Ned. I think football could learn from the world of darts. I think we could all learn. Everything I'd learn for the world of dance, Matt. It's made the world a better place, frankly. The legend that was Jockey Wilson, everybody in the darting world was afraid of Jockey Wilson. He once doing an exhibition match with Rod, the Prince of Style Harrington, picked up a dart and threw it at Harrington's midriff. It lodged in his midriff, died his white shirt, red. But his most devious trick, Jockey Wilson, was whenever they went flying en masse together, the darts players in an aeroplane, he would ask the stewards to give him a bag of dry roasted peanuts. He would put them all in his mouth, suck off the coating from the dry roasted peanuts, take them out of his mouth, let them dry a little bit, and then walk around the cabin, handing them out, and passing them off as normal salted peanuts. Wow. That is dark. That's dark. Fair play. Also, what a lovely image. All the, all the darts players on a huge dark. In a huge dart, yeah. Eyebone. Of course, Keith Deller famously did not like to fly, but that's another story for another. Ivo. Oh, turbulence. I don't think that this, I don't, I wouldn't call Cameroon in general, the Masters of the Dark Hearts, but I would say Cameroon versus Argentina in the 1990 World Cup contains some of the most egregious fouling and one of the most delicious fowling sequences you'll ever see. Claudio Canigia, one of the most beautiful footballers of all time. There's still posters of him and producer Simon's bedroom wall. He runs the length of the pitch, has Cameroon player, after Cameroon player tries to hack him down. And the final tackle described by Nick Hornby in fever pitch as a murderous assault by Benjamin Mass. He's just such a fantastic. And there's also that lovely bit of that aesthetic because I'm sure one of his boots comes off. So there's a boot flying. There's a sock flailing. It's everything you want. The greatest football match all time. Let's have the scores. Mina, you're just a lovely person. You gave those five points off you. You would be first, but you're last on 24. Oh my God, did you really take them off me? The law's the law. Dougie 25, Ned 27, Ivo 28. The whole thing feels awkward, doesn't it now? Do you want the five points back? Yes. Oh, I didn't expect you'd do that. We'll meet you halfway. Right. F1 champion, Max Verstappen, was not happy about being fined for swearing and even suggested it could force him to quit the sport. But who was or is sports greatest swearer? It's a quickie, this one. There used to be a golden envelope in my days, and I've got a thought in my head as to what I would have gone with for this. Well, let's pretend there is. Let's pretend there is. Okay, go on. We'll go left to right. Okay, well, this is Gennaro Gattuzo. He was coach of a Greek club, which I'm sorry, I don't remember the name of because it's not a very good club. And they asked him, how are the players coming on in training? And he said, you know, sometimes maybe good, sometimes maybe. And then you can figure that out. And it's become a mean because it's the greatest moment of swearing. And it's just a quickie run. And how did it go for them after that? Sometimes maybe a she. I was a pitchside reporter in the FAFA Cup final 2011 won by Manchester City. I know if you know, Wembley has the most deafening PA system in the world. And when you rush on to the pitch to interview players, you cannot hear a thing. You cannot hear your own questions. You certainly can't hear their own answers. You know roughly what you've said, but you can't hear a thing because there's just no... And reviewing the tape, I realised that within the space of about a minute and a half, both Micah Richards, Micah Richards had dropped the F-bomb, and I hadn't picked up on that because you're supposed to apologise. And then shortly after that, Mario Ballotelli, asked me, permission to swear. He said, can I say... And I nodded because I couldn't hear what he said, so I just wanted to be nice. So he took me up on the offer and he dropped the S-bomb as well. And yeah, Micah Richards is now TV's biggest star. And a very good pundit he is as well. Very good pundit is as well. I'm glad that you like some pundit. Yes, no. Still wears the pumps though. And the best, the best bit of swearing still remains John Aldridge on the touchline, Ireland, Mexico at the 94 World Cup. Oh yeah, that's a good one. Absolutely brilliant. But here's a little kind of limited edition, if you will, worth searching out on YouTube. Christian Daly, after the Scotland Germany match, or Germany Scotland, as it was in Dortmund, during the Bertie Vogue's press conference, who was the then Scotland manager. And let's just say that Christian, he thought the Germans were cheating. Leave it at that. Either. This is an English woman against a German. And listen, Jill Scott, MBE, was already, I think, a record appearance holder for England and a serial trophy winner. But I think she came to a lot more people's attention when she swore a German player in the final of Euro 2022 and said five words, two of which are off and you. Queen of the Jungle soon to follow. Let's move on. The answer I was looking for was, I don't know the exact words, but there's a great footage of when Tony Adams was, when David Ellery was miced up. Oh yes, yes. Against Arsenal Millwall. Realised that he was miced up. Yeah. Search that out on YouTube. It's not for Saturday. I'm never going to give a shout out to a Harrow housemaster. Facing what is undoubtedly crossroads in Korea. Let's cheer up Anthony Joshua. Let's sum him up in a word. Uh, Let's start with you, Ivo. Strictly. Dougie. Obsolete. Oh. Horizontal. Meena? Beaten. Beaten. Now, a little surprise, he's here. Right. We move on to any other business. It's still there, the old favourite. Let's start. We'll go from bottom to top. So, Dougie, let's start off. Oh, it's an age thing, isn't it? Oh, it's an age thing. I've now begun to determine which gigs and concerts I go to based on the venue where an artist is playing and in particular if I know the toilets are spacious clean and there's room at the bar if you want to be there to watch the gig from. I was at a place in Hackney recently, won't mention the venue, it's a good venue, we'll mention the band, La Luz, they were brilliant but the brush pasts every single five seconds and then you go to the toilet and it's not worth speaking about in there. Yeah. What would be your favourite venue then? Barbican. The Barbican. Are you hesitated? Yeah. Yeah. I feel it. I feel it. Well, this is the stress of being farther to a Formula One Driver, isn't it? Okay, next up, Ned. Podcasters who swear in podcast. There's a specific sort of subset of people who swear in podcasting because it's so it's a podcast so you can do it. And I mean people who have established careers over many, many years on national broadcast. Just say Gary Linneka. Yes, all right, Gary Linicka. People who swear because they can on podcasts. Yeah. Meena. People who hate AC. I just, honestly, I know. Air conditioning. Yes, I'm sorry. I didn't realize I had to actually say that. I just feel like a lot of people just think, because I'm a woman, that I'm going to get cold all the time. And I'm the other way. I actually plan my days with how hot I'm going to get. So I start off with wearing something small than something bigger, and then I can just layer up so that I can take it off. And then I come home or I go to the office and people have got it in ridiculous levels of heat. I don't understand. There's country's obsession with heat. And then you go into a shop to shop and you're so hot, you're sweating. I'm on TV or I'm doing something like punditry, which I know, according to Ned, I must be awful. And I'm just, and I'm sweating so much to the extent that I actually have a droplet on the end of my nose falling and they've got to come and powder it. Just put the AC on. I couldn't agree more. Ivo. I was chatting to a chess tutor outside the Alexandra Palace on Wednesday night. You're absolutely welcome to. And I believe that we should try to. It's like an AI generation, Ivo. No, he was, listen, he was trying to convince me to have chess lessons. And I was very tempted, but unfortunately he told me a lie, which I'm now here to correct. I didn't get out my phone to check at the time because I thought I would respect that. But we were talking about Paul Merton, the improviser and TV panelist. And he told me that Paul Merton's name isn't actually Paul Merton. It's Paul Merson. But they had to change his name because obviously, you know, there was already a Paul Merson. And I was absolutely thrilled that Gabriel, the chess instructor, had brought this to my attention. And it was the first thing I googled when I got in the car. And that's just not true. I've essentially here to call out my own gullibility. He did change his name. He did change his name. From Paul Martin. But that's a, Paul Martin was a juggler in Leeds. Conflict of interest. Let's have the final scores. Okay, Dougie, it's an age thing, but I can't, I can't give the wind to someone who goes to see gigs at the barbacons. 33 points for Dougie. Mina, 34. You're your own worst enemy, I'm afraid. You could have been far in front. But Ned, you've held on to that second place from last time. I have. You dismissed the possibility of me winning already. No, no, no. No, okay, all right. You're in the top two. And Ivo, 36. So Ivo, you lead going into that,end the Indefensible. Ned and Ivo, DTI, it's now called, because we've, that's happened in the last eight years, DTI, yeah. Well, it was called DT earlier. Yeah, no, that was a typo. Yeah, it felt weird. Yeah. I'm saying it, sorry. As the U.S. Goodbye days. It's a defendant. It's meant a save time. I feel it hasn't. It's a ridiculous statement that you have to answer however much it hurts. If I say, I mean you. Either you've scored the most points. Do you want to go first or second? I'll go first, please. Okay. I'd happily pay more tax so Kirstama can get better arson. Yeah. I mean, ideally, he should have the emirates to himself. I, uh, I, I, I, I, God. Um, I, um, I, I, you've really thrown me with this tax business, Josh, to be honest. Um, I, oh, um, it's the worst B TIE. And let's be honest, it wasn't the keyest time of it, it's paying more tax on the Dino. Ned, my intake of PEDs at the Tour de France puts Lance Armstrong to shame. PEDs, DTIs, whatever, three letter acronyms, I'd pump them all full of... Whatever I can get my hands on just to get myself over the line in the Tour de France. It's the only way of getting it done. I want to get my hands on just to get myself over the line in the Tour de France. It's the only way of getting it done. I want to get my hands on that half million quid and then hand it out to all my mates who were trying to get the better of me for three weeks of hell in France. Don't watch it. It's crap. Watch rugby them instead. Ned, obviously you've won. There's no competition. Obviously. Obviously you've won. Goodbye. Fighting Talk is a world's end production for BBC Radio 5 Live. Your afternoon on Five Live Sport with Mark Chapman. Start straight after this. Speak to you all again in eight years' time. Okay, podcast extra time. Ivo's gone because he's got to go to a corporate event in Manchester. He has 20 minutes to get to Houston. His train leaves Houston in 20 minutes. That's tight, isn't it? Would you be able to fancy that? I hate to say it, but it's a bicycle, isn't it? Get you down a bicycle? We really would. Do you think? Yeah. Yeah, especially with the tailwind. It's a westerly today, so that would hold. Worse, Defend the End Defense, where you've ever seen live, Dougie? Live. Was that the one? I know. You have to live, Dougie? In 120 was that, was that the one? You have to say, you have to say, yeah, to watch some of that live. It was, we'll always remember where we were. Now, Rick has been doing rankings, uh, for the podcast extra. So let's, uh, have a go at that and seeing as Wayne Rooney as Plymouth Argyll manager at the time of broadcast. I need some hope for Wayne's time. He's doing actually quite well. We're 16th. Yeah. And you'd say, you'd take that, wouldn't you? 16th, yeah. Is that good? 16th? Yes, very good. It is in the championship for Plymouth. Oh, I don't know. I'm not a football camp to live. No, yeah, yeah. You can't all be winners. I need some hope for Wayne's time in our dug out. So, it could go either way. So what I want is the most talented footballers that went on to be the best managers. One each, please. We've got Ivo's written down here. So I'll say it and you guys can have a bit of debate on that one. So, Mina. Sinitin Zadhan, obviously. Sorry, that's just ended the debate. We're talking about one of the world's greatest midfielders. What do you mean, do I think? Any one three Champions League's in a row? Yeah, but is he been proven at more than one club? Is that, wait, hold on, so now we're saying that. A little pause about we thought there was any sense in that. Yeah. And then we realize there was what I'd say Guardiolas. Well, we'll come to that. But I think is it in the hands a good one. I mean, I'll be ranking. Oh, okay. So then, you know, like, let's say, I'll be honest with you, Real Madrid, during that. But I think it's a good one. Guadiola. Oh, okay. So then, you know, like, let's say, I'll be honest with you. Real Madrid during that period spent less money than Leeds United. I can't see the same for Manchester City in Bad Guala, can I? No. So you're going to go with Leeds, Howard, David O'Leary. Ned. Well, I was going to go Ian Holloway. Oh, yes. Because I just simply wanted to mention from a Plymouth Argyll perspective, Josh, in all my years of broadcasting and making, you know, little films about sport, the most memorable day I ever had was filming with Ian Holloway when he was at Plymouth, Argyll. Was it? A day in the life of Ian Holloway. Oh. It got stranger and stranger and stranger as the day went on, cruising around Plymouth. And it ended with him turning on the Christmas tree lights in the middle of Plymouth City Centre on a stage with Linda Lusadi and SpongeBob Square Pants. Amazing. Square Pants Holloway and Lusadi. To give you an idea, he was there in the mid-2000s. Championship, you're in the championship. But what I mean is, Linda Lus Hardy was still taking on the Plymouth Christmas Lights in what's that? 2008, something like that. I've got a serious answer though, it's Brian Clough. Brian Clough. Yeah. The stats... That's a great answer. It stacks up, doesn't it? Because he scored... Had to double-check. Playing for Sunderland. No, I haven't ranked them yet. Middletfield Sunderland in 274 matches because he was injured beyond repair at the age of 29. He scored 251 goals in 274 matches. Brilliant. Dougie. On the subject of... Also, proved it at more than one club as a man. That's very important. Just going back to Christmas Lights for a second, I still can't get my head around the fact that Nicholas Cage turned on the Christmas lights in Bath with the opening line, Good Citizens of Bath. Genuinely happened. He literally, he's got a house there there? Yes, yes. Really? Yeah. Okay, but Ned, did he win the World Cup? Nicholas Cage? In all the way. Well, we're all come. Interesting, you say that, I mean. We're talking about great players who become great managers. Now we're not even caring about whether or not they're great players. Okay. Okay. Well, you know, here comes a serious answer. I'll give you the name. Mario Zagallo. Oh. Obviously. Obviously, first ever to win the World Cup as a player and a manager for Brazil in 58, 62 and of course as manager in 1970. I think a lot of people think the first person who did it in 74 then 1990. But that would be wrong to say, although when it comes to greatest ever sporting nickname, the answer would be Franz Beckenbauer with the Kaiser. Yeah, of course. So I sound a bit like I'm dotting eyes and crossing teas and in Merries I am. And Ivo's gone with Paolo de Canio. Oh, I see that coming. As a Swindon fan. So I think we can discount that. Yeah. Wait, do you think that's the best nickname? Yes, absolutely. What about Divine Ponytail? I quite like that. That's good. But the Kaiser just, and also Adidas had a boot, I think, called the Adidas Kaiser. Oh, I bet. That was nice. Yes. You know, your classic black and white boots. beautiful tongue in it as well, a lovely tongue. What's the divine ponytail in Italian? How does that say? I don't know. So is that originally an Italian? That's what I was going to ask. Is that a British translation? Sorry, we asked the same question. I don't know. No, it's definitely, the Italians, I think, christened them, the Divine Ponytail in Italian. And it would be great if I knew what it was just now, but I don't. But that's not going to stop me ending this sentence in a confident manner. It just reveals how awful my Italian is. Everyone expects it to be great. So, fourth, Paolo de Canio. Third, Mario Zagallo. Yeah. Because I think winning the World Cup with Brazil, anyone could do that, right? Fourth, Paolo de Canio. Third, Mario Zagallo. Because I think winning the World Cup with Brazil, anyone could do that, right? Yeah, yes. I'd say, anyone if they were in Brazil, winning the World Cup with Brazil, isn't as impressive as winning two European Cups with Nottingham Forest. Yeah. And the league with Derby County. This is doing something with like a, you know, with a British... But Sudan I've got first. I've got Zadam first. So there we go. We've got Zadam first. Derby County. This is doing something with like a, you know, with a British god. But Sudan I've got first. I've got Zadam first. So there we go. We've got Zadam first. Is it? Is it? What is it? Oh. Devine Cordino. Devine Cordino. Is that Divine Pocatello or a manager I haven't heard of that you? Currently boss at Yudanese. Yeah. Great player though Zadan, Clough Zagallo De Cania I thought Guadioa would be up there But there we go He wasn't a great Like he was a good player He wasn't a great player But he wasn't France back in Beller He wasn't Zadant He'll be an even better manager When he ditches the stupid hoodies I tell you that But he's a very good player It's just not on the level of like that Kenny Dalglish Yeah Kenny Dalglish? Yeah, Kenny Dalglish. I mean, yeah, Dalglish would have to be in that top bracket. Absolutely. But there we go. It's not, it's all done. Again, I go back to this. How did I not win this? You just, you just, you just out. No, I didn't. How did I not with the entire thing? Oh, we see. All right, yeah. Well, there we go back and listen to the tapes. It's all there. It's all there. It's all there. All evidence. All right. Let's do the rankings. Fourth, Paolo de Kaniya. I think we can all agree on that. Third, we're going with Mary Zagallo. Clough second. Zedam first. I think that feels. I think that feels fair enough to have a wrong. I'm telling you, I win all the things. And one from me, I'd go Gaudiola and I'd put him third between Clough and Zagala. You think Clough? Right, okay. I think Clough. We all think Clough. You're not a fan of Clough? No, I'm saying I think he's a better player than PEP, yeah? Yeah. Okay. And a better manager. I don't know. I'm not a fan of Clough? No, I'm saying I think he's a better player than Pep, yeah? Yeah. Okay. And a better manager. I don't know. I'm not sure about that, but yes. I mean, well, yes. No, he is. Better Pundit. Better Pundit. Better Pundit. But is PEP a pundit? Not yet. He will be. He will be. Right. He's on next week. Join Rick and PEP next week. Hello there.
