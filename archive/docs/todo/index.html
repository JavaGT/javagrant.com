<p>If I take an apple, the last item from a bowl, we would now say the bowl is empty. If I were to ask you what is in the bowl, you would say nothing. This language presents a certian understanding of the world, and reflects the construction of the world we have in our heads. Despite the absolute fullness of the bowl–of whichever transparent gas has taken the place of the apple I removed we say that nothing is in the bowl. This is practical for communicating the meaning you assume I am questioning (what items are in the bowl at this moment), but is clearly imprecise.</p>
<ul>
<li>This communication assumes and makes use of theory of minds</li>
<li>Assumuming the one saying the bowl is empty understands that, if they considered it from a more detailed, science-informed perspective, the bowl is not empty.</li>
<li>However if we just say the bowl is empoty, those without the understanding of gasses and matter, and the worlds we can't see may learn from the literal statement that was said that the bowl simply contains nothing.</li>
<li>Every moment of communication is an opportunity for learning about the world, but learning accurate models of the world requires precise language which gums up the works of communicating practically.</li>
<li>Is there a happy medium?</li>
<li>What happens when we apply this to more important contexts? What happens when the language we use is imprecise? Miscommunication? Misinterpretation? Bad models of the world? Worse?</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>I am genuinely very privileged
<ul>
<li>Always had food</li>
<li>Always had decent shelter</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>My thoughts on luck, including luck as an attitude.</li>
<li>Collected ideas on luck e.g. from Swix.io &amp; Eric Barker
<ul>
<li>Specific focus on networking–understanding others, having them understand you (and want to work with you) and how opportunities flow through networks.
<ul>
<li>Networks are just a shitty form of community. 'Networking' seems to be just the commodified 'social capital' interpretation of knowing people, engaging with people. Networking is capitalism's warped view of community. Some economist's wet dream grounded in game-theory and perceiving every human as a little robot capable of producing n* units of commodity per minute. *scaled by average follower-count of linkedin connections.</li>
<li>The more diverse your community–the more it intersects with other communities vastly different to your own and the larger it is, the more opportunity there is to engage with ideas and people the interest you.</li>

<ul>
<li>There is no 'real world'</li>
<li>School is the opportunity to try things. Jump into sports teams, try out different fields of research, (hopefully) learn about our social systems and why they exist and are shaped how they are, learn to challenge things(?), make friends and resolve conflicts. It teaches us how to interact with people that might not reach our social circles without external forces. Oh people have different diets? Some people use wheelchairs? Some people look or act different to us and our families? These are things not everyone would learn if it weren't for the school system.
<ul>
<li>When people say school didn't prepare them for the real world, often it seems they are reffering to money. Newsflash, money isn't the 'real world' it is one factor in life and it is entirely a social construct. They are just too deep in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalist_Realism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Capitalist Realism</a> to imagine any other purpose to life than hoarding resources.</li>

<p>Beginning my degree, I was surprised by many aspects of the academic system. I was unfamiliar with even simple elements, for example, correctly referencing sources in my essays. While I may not have had access to experienced family members, I substituted for another resource — my friends. I’m proud of my success at university, much of it due to my ability to engage with students and faculty to problem-solve and overcome difficulties in the new environment.</p>

<p>I despise these expressions. They are used to cover vauge, often ideological ideas that are being presented as truth.</p>
<p>So-called common-sense and chiché are used as replacements for thought.</p>
